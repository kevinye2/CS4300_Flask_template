All fees and other charges for such\\ntreatment and services shall be limited to such charges as prevail in\\nthe same community for similar treatment of injured persons of a like\\nstandard of living.\\n  The chair shall prepare and establish a schedule for the state, or\\nschedules limited to defined localities, of charges and fees for such\\nmedical treatment and care, and including all medical, dental, surgical,\\noptometric or other attendance or treatment, nurse and hospital service,\\nmedicine, optometric services, crutches, eye-glasses, false teeth,\\nartificial eyes, orthotics, prosthetic devices, functional assistive and\\nadaptive devices and apparatus in accordance with and to be subject to\\nchange pursuant to rules promulgated by the chair. Before preparing such\\nschedule for the state or schedules for limited localities the chair\\nshall request the president of the medical society of the state of New\\nYork and the president of the New York state osteopathic medical society\\nto submit to him or her a report on the amount of remuneration deemed by\\nsuch society to be fair and adequate for the types of medical care to be\\nrendered under this chapter, but consideration shall be given to the\\nview of other interested parties. In the case of physical therapy fees\\nschedules the chair shall request the president of a recognized\\nprofessional association representing physical therapists in the state\\nof New York to submit to him or her a report on the amount of\\nremuneration deemed by such association to be fair and reasonable for\\nthe type of physical therapy services rendered under this chapter, but\\nconsideration shall be given to the views of other interested parties.\\nThe chair shall also prepare and establish a schedule for the state, or\\nschedules limited to defined localities, of charges and fees for\\noutpatient hospital services not covered under the medical fee schedule\\npreviously referred to in this subdivision, to be determined in\\naccordance with and to be subject to change pursuant to rules\\npromulgated by the chair. Before preparing such schedule for the state\\nor schedules for limited localities the chair shall request the\\npresident of the hospital association of New York state to submit to him\\nor her a report on the amount of remuneration deemed by such association\\nto be fair and adequate for the types of hospital outpatient care to be\\nrendered under this chapter, but consideration shall be given to the\\nviews of other interested parties.

The amounts payable by the employer for such treatment and\\nservices shall be the fees and charges established by such schedule.\\nNothing in this schedule, however, shall prevent voluntary payment of\\namounts higher or lower than the fees and charges fixed therein, but no\\nphysician rendering medical treatment or care, and no physical or\\noccupational therapist rendering their respective physical or\\noccupational therapy services may receive payment in any higher amount\\nunless such increased amount has been authorized by the employer, or by\\ndecision as provided in section thirteen-g of this article. Nothing in\\nthis section shall be construed as preventing the employment of a duly\\nauthorized physician on a salary basis by an authorized compensation\\nmedical bureau or laboratory.\\n  (b) In the case of persons, injured outside of this state, but\\nentitled to compensation or benefits under this chapter, the provisions\\nas to selection of authorized physicians shall be inapplicable. In such\\ncases the employer shall promptly provide all necessary medical\\ntreatment and care but if the employer fail to provide the same, after\\nrequest by the injured employee such injured employee may do so at the\\nexpense of the employer. The employee shall not be entitled to recover\\nany amount expended by him for such treatment or services unless he\\nshall have requested the employer to furnish the same and the employer\\nshall have refused or neglected to do so, or unless the nature of the\\ninjury required such treatment and services and the employer or his\\nsuperintendent or foreman having knowledge of such injury shall have\\nneglected to provide the same; nor shall any claim for medical or\\nsurgical treatment be valid and enforceable, as against such employer,\\nunless within twenty days following the first treatment, the physician\\ngiving such treatment, furnish to the employer and the chairman a report\\nof such injury and treatment, on a form prescribed by the chairman. The\\nboard may, however, by the unanimous vote of a panel of not less than\\nthree members qualified to act, excuse the failure to give such notice\\nwithin twenty days when it finds it to be in the interest of justice to\\ndo so, and may, subject to the limitations contained in section\\ntwenty-eight of this chapter, make an award for the reasonable value of\\nsuch medical or surgical treatment. All fees and other charges for such\\ntreatment and services, whether furnished by the employer or otherwise,\\nshall be subject to regulation by the board as provided in section\\ntwenty-four of this chapter, and shall be limited to such charges as\\nprevail in the same community for similar treatment of injured persons\\nof a like standard of living.\\n  (c) The liability of an employer for medical treatment as herein\\nprovided shall not be affected by the fact that his employee was injured\\nthrough the fault or negligence of a third party, not in the same\\nemploy. The employer shall, however, have an additional cause of action\\nagainst such third party to recover any amounts paid by him for such\\nmedical treatment, in like manner as provided in section twenty-nine of\\nthis chapter.\\n  (d) (1) In the event that an insurer or health benefits plan makes\\npayments for medical and/or hospital services for or on behalf of an\\ninjured employee they shall be entitled to be reimbursed for such\\npayments by the carrier or employer within the limits of the medical and\\nhospital fee schedules if the board determines that the claim is\\ncompensable. For the purposes of this section, an insurer or health\\nbenefits plan includes a medical expense indemnity corporation, a health\\nor hospital service corporation, a commercial insurance company licensed\\nto write accident and health insurance in the state of New York, a\\nhealth maintenance organization operating in accordance with article\\nforty-three of the insurance law or article forty-four of the public\\nhealth law, or a self-insured or self-funded health care benefits plan\\noperated by, or on behalf of, any business, municipality or other entity\\n(including an employee welfare fund as defined in article forty-four of\\nthe insurance law or any other union trust fund or union health benefits\\nplan). Notwithstanding any other provision of law, in no event shall the\\ncarrier or employer be required to reimburse the insurer or health\\nbenefits plan in an amount greater than the amount paid for medical and\\nhospital services for or on behalf of the injured employer by such\\ncorporation or company; provided, however, if the carrier or employer\\ndoes not reimburse the insurer or health benefits plan within thirty\\ndays after the board determines that the claim is compensable, the\\ncarrier or employer shall reimburse the insurer or health benefits plan\\nat the amount the carrier or employer would be obligated to reimburse\\nthe hospital or other provider of medical services if the carrier or\\nemployer made payment directly to the provider of medical and/or\\nhospital services pursuant to this chapter (or, in the case of inpatient\\nhospital services, pursuant to paragraphs (b) and (b-1) of subdivision\\none of section twenty-eight hundred seven-c of the public health law).\\nUpon reimbursement to the insurer or health benefits plan pursuant to\\nthis subdivision, the carrier or employer shall be relieved of liability\\nfor the medical and/or hospital services for which payment has been made\\nby the insurer or health benefits plan.\\n  (2) An insurer or health benefits plan entitled to reimbursement\\npursuant to paragraph one of this subdivision shall receive copies of\\nthe hearing and decision notices and shall develop with the carrier or\\nemployer its own mechanisms and standard operating procedures for\\npayment of undisputed claims for reimbursement. In cases of disputed\\nclaims for reimbursement that are filed with the board within three\\nyears of the date of payment for services rendered by the health care\\nprovider or within ninety days of the effective date of a chapter of the\\nlaws of nineteen hundred ninety-two, entitled \"AN ACT to amend the\\nworkers' compensation law, in relation to reimbursement of insurers and\\nhealth benefit plans\", whichever is later, the sole remedy of the\\ninsurer or health benefit plan to recover on a claim arising pursuant to\\nthis subdivision shall be the submission of the controversy to mandatory\\narbitration or other alternative dispute resolution procedures as\\ndefined by rules and regulations promulgated by the chair in accordance\\nwith subdivision (h) of this section.\\n  (e) The board, on its own motion, or a referee, upon the\\nrecommendation of the compensation medical director for the board,\\nhearing a claim for compensation may require examination of any\\nclaimant, or of the testimony, reports and exhibits, or both, by a\\nphysician especially qualified with respect to the diagnosis or\\ntreatment of the disability for which compensation is claimed; and may\\nrequire a report from such physician on the diagnosis, the causal\\nrelationship between the alleged injury and subsequent disability or\\ndeath, proper treatment, and the extent of the disability of such\\nclaimant. The employer or his or her insurance carrier shall pay for\\nsuch examination in an amount to be directed by the chairman.\\n  The chairman may in his discretion designate physicians of outstanding\\nqualifications in such fields of medicine as he deems essential in order\\nto ascertain the diagnosis, the causal relationship between the alleged\\ninjury and subsequent disability, the type of medical care and operative\\nprocedure requisite in particular cases where such matters are not\\nreadily determinable by the regularly employed medical examiners of the\\nboard. Each of such physicians shall have had, prior to his or her\\ndesignation, at least five years of practice in the field with respect\\nto which he or she is designated, and shall receive a fee for each case,\\nor shall be paid on a per diem basis, as determined by the chairman.\\nClaimants maybe required to submit to examination by such physicians in\\nthe manner hereinbefore specified. The contents of reports of designated\\nphysicians when introduced in evidence shall constitute prima facie\\nevidence of fact as to the matter contained therein, and the makers of\\nsuch reports shall be subject to examination upon demand and shall be\\npaid an additional fee, as determined by the chairman, for testifying in\\neach case.\\n  (f) Copies of medical reports of claimant's attending physician or\\nmedical consultant, made pursuant to this chapter subsequent to the date\\nof the request provided for in this subdivision and antedating not more\\nthan thirty days, shall be transmitted by the physician or consultant to\\nthe claimant's licensed representative or attorney representing the\\nclaimant before the board upon his written request therefor accompanied\\nby a notice of his retainer and consent to such transmittal signed by\\nthe claimant.\\n  (g) Every hospital operating in the state shall, within twenty days of\\nreceiving a written request by a claimant, claimant's representative,\\nemployer, carrier or special fund created under this chapter, provide to\\nsuch claimant, claimant's representative, employer, carrier or special\\nfund for use in board proceedings the medical records of an employee who\\nhas received treatment in such hospital and who is claiming benefits\\nunder this chapter. Each hospital shall designate at least one officer\\nor employee who shall be responsible for provision of such records on\\nwritten request, and to whom the board, claimant, claimant's, employer,\\ncarrier representative or special fund may address informal inquiries\\nregarding provision of such records.\\n  No hospital shall be required to produce the records of any claimant\\npursuant to this section without receiving the cost of copying such\\nrecords as determined by the chair. Such cost shall be paid by the\\nrequesting party except that the employer or carrier or special fund\\nshall reimburse a claimant or claimant's representative the cost of an\\ninitial set of such records where the request is made by a claimant or\\nclaimant's representative. Should the hospital not be able to provide\\nthe requested records within twenty days, they shall notify in writing\\nthe party requesting the records of the reason why the records were not\\nprovided and the date on which they will be provided. Such date shall be\\nwithin a reasonable period of time, but shall not exceed thirty days.\\nFailure to either provide the records within twenty days or to provide a\\nreason why the records have not been provided shall subject the hospital\\nto a fine of two hundred dollars which shall be imposed by the chair\\npayable to the board upon finding that this subdivision has not been\\ncomplied with. No hospital shall be required to produce the records of\\nany claimant without receiving its customary fees or charges for\\nreproduction of such records.\\n  (h) (1) The chair shall require the performance of computer searches\\nto identify injured employees who, with respect to the same injury or\\nillness, have filed claims under the provisions of this chapter and made\\nclaims to, or on their behalf with, a payor of medical payments eligible\\nfor reimbursement pursuant to this section. Such searches shall be done\\nat least quarterly upon request of payors and upon submission to the\\nboard of computer tapes containing the information the chair shall need\\nto identify injured employees who file dual claims under this section.\\nAt least quarterly, the chair shall identify injured employees who have\\nfiled dual claims by social security number and workers' compensation\\nboard number and shall notify the payor of such results.\\n  (2) Such payor shall use the information of dual filings solely for\\nthe purpose of reimbursement from the carrier or employer. The chair,\\nupon a finding that such entity has used the information for purposes\\nother than reimbursement from the carrier or employer, may, after\\nhearing, impose a penalty of not more than ten thousand dollars and may\\nprohibit such entity from receiving information under this subdivision\\nfor up to three years.\\n  (3) The chair shall adopt rules and regulations to carry out the\\nprovisions of this section, which rules and regulations shall provide\\nfor alternative dispute resolution procedures for settlement of disputed\\nclaims for reimbursement under subdivision (d) of this section including\\nbut not limited to referral and submission of disputed claims to\\nmandatory arbitration with private arbitration associations. Such rules\\nand regulations may provide for a reasonable fee to be charged to payors\\nfor computer searches. Claims for computer searches submitted to the\\nboard prior to March thirty-first, nineteen hundred ninety-two, may be\\nsubmitted with a payment date on or after April first, nineteen hundred\\neighty-eight. Claims for reimbursement submitted after March\\nthirty-first, nineteen hundred ninety-two, shall have a payment date\\nthat is no later than three years prior to the date of submission of the\\nclaim for matching purposes to the board. If disputed, these claims\\nshall be resolved through the dispute resolution procedures set forth in\\nthis section. Upon resolution of the reimbursement dispute in accordance\\nwith this section, the amount paid to the prevailing party shall be\\nincreased by the amount of any fee paid to the arbitrator or incurred by\\nreason of any other alternate dispute resolution procedure.\\n  (i) (1) When a claimant or pharmacy submits a claim to the employer or\\nits carrier for payment of prescribed medicine or for reimbursement of\\nthe cost of prescribed medicine which the employer is required to\\nprovide under this section, the employer or carrier shall pay the amount\\nprescribed by the fee schedule adopted under section thirteen-o of this\\narticle, or if the prescribed medicine is not included on the current\\nfee schedule, the usual and customary charges for such prescribed\\nmedicine, within forty-five days of receipt of the claim, unless the\\nliability of the employer or carrier on the claim for which the claimant\\nseeks payment or reimbursement of payment for the prescribed medicine is\\nnot established, or the prescribed medicine is not for a causally\\nrelated condition.\\n  (2) Where the liability of the employer or carrier on the claim for\\nwhich the claimant seeks payment or reimbursement of payment for the\\nprescribed medicine or reimbursement for payment of prescribed medicine\\nis not established, or is not for a causally related condition, the\\nemployer or carrier shall pay any undisputed portion of the claim in\\naccordance with this section and notify the claimant or pharmacy, as\\nappropriate, in writing within forty-five days of receipt of the claim:\\n  (i) that the claim is not being paid and explaining the reasons for\\nnonpayment; or\\n  (ii) to request all additional information reasonably needed to\\ndetermine the employer's or carrier's liability for the claim. Upon\\nreceipt of the information requested in this subparagraph, the employer\\nor carrier shall comply with paragraph one of this subdivision.\\n  (3) Each claim for payment of prescribed medicine or reimbursement for\\npayment of prescribed medicine that is processed in violation of this\\nsection shall constitute a separate violation. In addition to the other\\npenalties provided in this chapter, any employer or carrier that fails\\nto reimburse the claimant or pay the pharmacy, as appropriate and as\\nrequired in this section shall be obligated to pay to the claimant or\\npharmacy the amount prescribed on the fee schedule adopted under section\\nthirteen-o of this article, or if the prescribed medicine is not\\nincluded on the current fee schedule, the usual and customary charges\\nfor the prescribed medicine plus simple interest at the rate set forth\\nin section five thousand four of the civil practice law and rules.\\n  (4) Nothing in this subdivision shall prohibit employers or carriers\\nfrom agreeing to or arranging for direct billing by the pharmacy to the\\nemployer or carrier for the cost of prescribed medicine, in order for\\nclaimants to more promptly receive prescribed medicine for which\\nemployers and carriers are liable under this section.\\n  (5) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, if an\\nemployer or carrier has contracted with a pharmacy to provide prescribed\\nmedicine to claimants, then such employer or carrier may require\\nclaimants to obtain all prescribed medicines from the pharmacy with\\nwhich it has contracted, except if a medical emergency occurs and it\\nwould not be reasonably possible to obtain immediately required\\nprescribed medicine from the pharmacy with which the employer or carrier\\nhas a contract. An employer or carrier that requires claimants to obtain\\nprescribed medicines from a pharmacy with which it has a contract must\\nnotify claimants of the pharmacy or pharmacies with which it has a\\ncontract, the locations and addresses of the pharmacy or pharmacies, if\\napplicable, how to initially fill and refill prescriptions through the\\nmail, internet, telephone or other means, and any other required\\ninformation that must be supplied to the pharmacy or pharmacies. If the\\npharmacy or pharmacies with which the employer or carrier contracts does\\nnot offer mail order service and does not have a physical location\\nwithin a reasonable distance from the claimant, as defined by regulation\\nof the board, the claimant may obtain prescribed medicines at the\\npharmacy or pharmacies of his or her choice and the employer or carrier\\nwill be liable for such charges in accordance with the fee schedule\\nprescribed in section thirteen-o of this chapter.\\n",

The\\nboard, with the approval of the superintendent of financial services,\\nshall issue and maintain a list of pre-authorized procedures under this\\nsection. Such list of pre-authorized procedures shall be issued and\\nmaintained for the purpose of expediting authorization of treatment of\\ninjured workers. Such list of pre-authorized procedures shall not\\nprohibit varied treatment when the treating provider demonstrates the\\nappropriateness and medical necessity of such treatment.\\n  (6) (a) Any interference by any person with the selection by an\\ninjured employee of an authorized physician to treat him, except when\\nthe selection is made pursuant to article ten-A of this chapter, and the\\nimproper influencing or attempt by any person improperly to influence\\nthe medical opinion of any physician who has treated or examined an\\ninjured employee, shall be a misdemeanor; provided, however, that it\\nshall not constitute interference or improper influence if, in the\\npresence of such injured employee's physician, an employer, his carrier\\nor agent should recommend or provide information concerning\\nrehabilitation services or the availability thereof to an injured\\nemployee or his family.\\n  (b) Except as otherwise permitted by law, an employer, carrier, or\\nthird-party administrator shall not interfere or attempt to interfere\\nwith the selection by an injured employee of, or treatment by, an\\nauthorized medical provider, including by directing or attempting to\\ndirect that the injured employee seek treatment from a specific provider\\nor type of provider selected by the employer, carrier, or third-party\\nadministrator. It shall not constitute improper interference under this\\nparagraph if the direction or attempt to direct the injured employee to\\nreceive treatment from a specific provider or type of provider\\noriginates from the authorized medical provider while in the course of\\nproviding treatment to the injured employee.\\n  (i) Notwithstanding any other provision in this chapter, the chair\\nshall by regulation establish a performance standard concerning the\\nsubject of any penalty imposed under this paragraph against an employer,\\ncarrier or third-party administrator. The performance standard\\nestablished by the chair shall be used to measure compliance with this\\nparagraph by employers, carriers and third-party administrators. The\\nchair shall apply the performance standard based on multiple factors,\\nincluding but not limited to, findings of improper interference\\nsubmitted as complaints to the board's monitoring unit, unreasonable\\nobjections to medical care, unwarranted objections to variances, medical\\nbilling disputes, case delays brought about by employers, carriers and\\nthird-party administrators, and the unreasonable denial of medical care.\\n  (ii) Upon validating an allegation that the employer, carrier or\\nthird-party administrator has failed to meet the promulgated performance\\nstandard, a penalty shall be assessed by the board upon notice to the\\nemployer, carrier or third-party administrator. The board shall impose\\nsuch penalty against the carrier, employer or third-party administrator\\nin the amount of fifty dollars per violation identified in subparagraph\\n(i) of this paragraph. The penalties for violations identified in\\nsubparagraph (i) of this paragraph, may be aggregated into a single\\npenalty upon a finding that an employer, carrier or third-party\\nadministrator has interfered with an injured employee's necessary\\nmedical treatment and care. Such aggregate penalty or assessment shall\\nbe based upon the number of violations as multiplied against the\\napplicable penalty or assessment, but may be negotiated by the chair's\\ndesignee in full satisfaction of the penalty or assessment. Any\\naggregate penalty or assessment issued under this paragraph shall be\\nissued administratively, and the chair shall, by regulation, specify the\\nmethod of review or redetermination, and the presentment of evidence and\\nobjections shall occur solely upon the documentation. Any final\\ndetermination shall be subject to review under section twenty-three of\\nthis article but penalties may not be subject to a stay. A final\\ndetermination that an employer, carrier or third-party administrator has\\nengaged in a pattern of interference with an injured worker's access to\\nmedically necessary medical care shall result in the imposition of an\\naggregate penalty and publication of notice of such finding on the\\nboard's web page.\\n  (7)(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter to the\\ncontrary, any insurance carrier authorized to transact the business of\\nworkers' compensation insurance in this state, self-insurer or the state\\ninsurance fund may contract with a network or networks, legally and\\nproperly organized, to perform diagnostic tests, x-ray examinations,\\nmagnetic resonance imaging, or other radiological examinations or tests\\nof claimants and may require claimant to obtain or undergo such\\ndiagnostic test, x-ray examinations, magnetic resonance imaging or other\\nradiological examinations or tests with a provider or at a facility that\\nis affiliated with the network or networks with which the carrier\\ncontracts, except if a medical emergency occurs requiring an immediate\\ndiagnostic test, x-ray examination, magnetic resonance imaging or other\\nradiological examination or test or if the network with which the\\ninsurance carrier, self-insurer or the state insurance fund contracts\\ndoes not have a provider or facility able to perform the examination or\\ntest within a reasonable distance from the claimant's residence or place\\nof employment, as defined by regulation of the board.\\n  (b) Any insurance carrier, self-insurer or the state insurance fund\\nwhich requires claimants to obtain or undergo diagnostic tests, x-ray\\nexaminations, magnetic resonance imaging or other radiological\\nexaminations or tests with a provider or at a facility affiliated with a\\nnetwork or networks with which it contracts, must notify the claimant of\\nthe name and contact information for the network or networks at the same\\ntime the written statement of the claimant's rights as required by\\nsubdivision two of section one hundred ten of this chapter or\\nimmediately after imposing such requirement if the time period within\\nwhich the written statement of the claimant's rights as required by\\nsubdivision two of section one hundred ten of this chapter has expired.\\n  (c) At the time a request for authorization for special diagnostic\\ntests, x-ray examinations, magnetic resonance imaging or other\\nradiological examinations or tests costing more than one thousand\\ndollars as required by subdivision five of this section is approved, the\\ninsurance carrier, self-insurer or state insurance fund, or if so\\ndelegated the network with which the insurance carrier, self-insurer or\\nstate insurance fund has contracted, shall notify the physician\\nrequesting authorization of the requirement that the claimant obtain or\\nundergo the special diagnostic test, x-ray examination, magnetic\\nresonance imaging or other radiological examination or test with a\\nprovider or at a facility affiliated with the network or networks with\\nwhich it has contracted, the contact information for the network and a\\nlist of the providers and facilities within the claimant's geographic\\nlocation, as defined by regulation of the board. The claimant, in\\nconsultation with the provider who requested the special diagnostic\\ntest, x-ray examination, magnetic resonance imaging or other\\nradiological test or exam, will determine the provider or facility from\\nwithin the network which will perform such diagnostic test, x-ray\\nexamination, magnetic resonance imaging or other radiological\\nexamination or test.\\n  (d) The results of the special diagnostic test, x-ray examination,\\nmagnetic resonance imaging or other radiological test or exam must be\\nsent to the physician who requested the test or exam immediately upon\\ncompletion of the report detailing the results.\\n",

Except as otherwise provided\\nin this chapter, the average weekly wages of the injured employee at the\\ntime of the injury shall be taken as the basis upon which to compute\\ncompensation or death benefits, and shall be determined as follows:\\n  1. If the injured employee shall have worked in the employment in\\nwhich he was working at the time of the accident, whether for the same\\nemployer or not, during substantially the whole of the year immediately\\npreceding his injury, his average annual earnings shall consist of three\\nhundred times the average daily wage or salary for a six-day worker, and\\ntwo hundred sixty times the average daily wage or salary for a five-day\\nworker, which he shall have earned in such employment during the days\\nwhen so employed;\\n  2. If the injured employee shall not have worked in such employment\\nduring substantially the whole of such year, his average annual\\nearnings, if a six-day worker, shall consist of three hundred times the\\naverage daily wage or salary, and, if a five-day worker, two hundred and\\nsixty times the average daily wage or salary, which an employee of the\\nsame class working substantially the whole of such immediately preceding\\nyear in the same or in a similar employment in the same or a neighboring\\nplace shall have earned in such employment during the days when so\\nemployed;\\n  3. If either of the foregoing methods of arriving at the annual\\naverage earnings of an injured employee cannot reasonably and fairly be\\napplied, such annual average earnings shall be such sum as, having\\nregard to the previous earnings of the injured employee and of other\\nemployees of the same or most similar class, working in the same or most\\nsimilar employment, or other employment as defined in this chapter, in\\nthe same or neighboring locality, shall reasonably represent the annual\\nearning capacity of the injured employee in the employment in which he\\nwas working at the time of the accident, provided, however, his average\\nannual earnings shall consist of not less than two hundred times the\\naverage daily wage or salary which he shall have earned in such\\nemployment during the days when so employed, further provided, however,\\nthat if the injured employee shall have been in the military or naval\\nservice of the United States or of the state of New York within twelve\\nmonths prior to his injury, and his average annual earnings cannot be\\nfairly determined under subdivisions one and two, then the average\\nannual earnings shall be determined by multiplying his average daily\\nwage during the days so employed by not less than two hundred and forty;\\n  4. The average weekly wages of an employee shall be one-fifty-second\\npart of his average annual earnings;\\n  5. If it be established that the injured employee was under the age of\\ntwenty-five when injured, and that under normal conditions his wages\\nwould be expected to increase, that fact may be considered in arriving\\nat his average weekly wages.\\n  6. If the injured employee is concurrently engaged in more than one\\nemployment at the time of injury, the employee's average weekly wages\\nshall be calculated upon the basis of wages earned from all concurrent\\nemployments covered under this chapter. The employer in whose employment\\nthe employee was injured shall be liable for the benefits that would\\nhave been payable if the employee had had no other employment.

In all other cases of permanent partial disability,\\nthe compensation shall be sixty-six and two-thirds percent of the\\ndifference between the injured employee's average weekly wages and his\\nor her wage-earning capacity thereafter in the same employment or\\notherwise.  Compensation under this paragraph shall be payable during\\nthe continuance of such permanent partial disability, without the\\nnecessity for the claimant who is entitled to benefits at the time of\\nclassification to demonstrate ongoing attachment to the labor market,\\nbut subject to reconsideration of the degree of such impairment by the\\nboard on its own motion or upon application of any party in interest\\nhowever, all compensation payable under this paragraph shall not exceed\\n(i) five hundred twenty-five weeks in cases in which the loss of\\nwage-earning capacity is greater than ninety-five percent; (ii) five\\nhundred weeks in cases in which the loss of wage-earning capacity is\\ngreater than ninety percent but not more than ninety-five percent; (iii)\\nfour hundred seventy-five weeks in cases in which the loss of\\nwage-earning capacity is greater than eighty-five percent but not more\\nthan ninety percent; (iv) four hundred fifty weeks in cases in which the\\nloss of wage-earning capacity is greater than eighty percent but not\\nmore than eighty-five percent; (v) four hundred twenty-five weeks in\\ncases in which the loss of wage-earning capacity is greater than\\nseventy-five percent but not more than eighty percent; (vi) four hundred\\nweeks in cases in which the loss of wage-earning capacity is greater\\nthan seventy percent but not more than seventy-five percent; (vii) three\\nhundred seventy-five weeks in cases in which the loss of wage-earning\\ncapacity is greater than sixty percent but not more than seventy\\npercent; (viii) three hundred fifty weeks in cases in which the loss of\\nwage-earning capacity is greater than fifty percent but not more than\\nsixty percent; (ix) three hundred weeks in cases in which the loss of\\nwage-earning capacity is greater than forty percent but not more than\\nfifty percent; (x) two hundred seventy-five weeks in cases in which the\\nloss of wage-earning capacity is greater than thirty percent but not\\nmore than forty percent; (xi) two hundred fifty weeks in cases in which\\nthe loss of wage-earning capacity is greater than fifteen percent but\\nnot more than thirty percent; and (xii) two hundred twenty-five weeks in\\ncases in which the loss of wage-earning capacity is fifteen percent or\\nless. For a claimant with a date of accident or disablement after the\\neffective date of the chapter of the laws of two thousand seventeen that\\namended this subdivision, where the carrier or employer has provided\\ncompensation pursuant to subdivision five of this section beyond one\\nhundred thirty weeks from the date of accident or disablement, all\\nsubsequent weeks in which compensation was paid shall be considered to\\nbe benefit weeks for purposes of this section, with the carrier or\\nemployer receiving credit for all such subsequent weeks against the\\namount of maximum benefit weeks when permanent partial disability under\\nthis section is determined. In the event of payment for intermittent\\ntemporary partial disability paid after one hundred thirty weeks from\\nthe date of accident or disablement, such time shall be reduced to a\\nnumber of weeks, for which the carrier will receive a credit against the\\nmaximum benefit weeks. For a claimant with a date of accident or\\ndisablement after the effective date of the chapter of the laws of two\\nthousand seventeen that amended this subdivision, when permanency is at\\nissue, and a claimant has submitted medical evidence that he or she is\\nnot at maximum medical improvement, and the carrier has produced or has\\nhad a reasonable opportunity to produce an independent medical\\nexamination concerning maximum medical improvement, and the board has\\ndetermined that the claimant is not yet at maximum medical improvement,\\nthe carrier shall not receive a credit for benefit weeks prior to a\\nfinding that the claimant has reached maximum medical improvement, at\\nwhich time the carrier shall receive credit for any weeks of temporary\\ndisability paid to claimant after such finding against the maximum\\nbenefit weeks awarded under this subdivision. For those claimants\\nclassified as permanently partially disabled who no longer receive\\nindemnity payments because they have surpassed their number of maximum\\nbenefit weeks, the following provisions will apply:\\n  (1) There will be a presumption that medical services shall continue\\nnotwithstanding the completion of the time period for compensation set\\nforth in this section and the burden of going forward and the burden of\\nproof will lie with the carrier, self-insured employer or state\\ninsurance fund in any application before the board to discontinue or\\nsuspend such services. Medical services will continue during the\\npendency of any such application and any appeals thereto.\\n  (2) The board is directed to promulgate regulations that establish an\\nindependent review and appeal by an outside agent or entity of the\\nboard's choosing of any administrative law judge's determination to\\ndiscontinue or suspend medical services before a final determination of\\nthe board.\\n  x. Impairment guidelines. The chair shall consult with representatives\\nof labor, business, medical providers, insurance carriers, and\\nself-insured employers regarding revisions to permanency impairment\\nguidelines, including permitting review and comment by such\\nrepresentatives' chosen medical advisors, and after consultation shall,\\nin accordance with the state administrative procedure act, propose for\\npublic comment revised permanency guidelines concerning medical\\nevaluation of impairment and the determination of permanency as set\\nforth in paragraphs a through v of this subdivision by September first,\\ntwo thousand seventeen, with such guidelines to be adopted by the chair\\nby January first, two thousand eighteen. The permanency impairment\\nguidelines shall be reflective of advances in modern medicine that\\nenhance healing and result in better outcomes. In the event the chair\\nfails to adopt such permanency guidelines to be effective by January\\nfirst, two thousand eighteen, the chair shall adopt, by emergency\\nregulation, permanency impairment guidelines. The permanency impairment\\nguidelines adopted by emergency regulation shall be either the\\nimpairment guidelines proposed by the chair on September first, two\\nthousand seventeen or the permanency impairment guidelines created by\\nthe consultant to the board and submitted to representatives of labor,\\nbusiness, medical providers, insurance carriers, and self-insured\\nemployers, as voted on in an emergency meeting of the board to be held\\non December twenty-ninth, two thousand seventeen. In the event the board\\nis unable to reach a decision at such meeting, the chair shall select\\nthe permanency guidelines to be adopted by emergency regulations.\\nEmergency regulations shall be in effect for ninety days or until such\\ntime as permanent regulations are adopted by the chair. As of January\\nfirst, two thousand eighteen the 2012 permanency impairment guidelines\\npertaining to paragraphs a through v of subdivision three of section\\nfifteen of this article are repealed, and shall have no effect. The\\nboard shall train adjudication and other staff to ensure timely and\\neffective implementation.\\n  4. Effect of award. An award made to a claimant under subdivision\\nthree shall in case of death arising from causes other than the injury\\nbe payable to and for the benefit of the persons following:\\n  a. If there be a surviving spouse and no child of the deceased under\\nthe age of eighteen years, to such spouse.\\n  b. If there be a surviving spouse and surviving child or children of\\nthe deceased under the age of eighteen years, one-half shall be payable\\nto the surviving spouse and the other half to the surviving child or\\nchildren.\\n  The board may in its discretion require the appointment of a guardian\\nfor the purpose of receiving the compensation of the minor child. In the\\nabsence of such a requirement by the board the appointment for such a\\npurpose shall not be necessary.\\n  c. If there be a surviving child or children of the deceased under the\\nage of eighteen years, but no surviving spouse then to such child or\\nchildren.\\n  d. If there be no surviving spouse and no surviving child or children\\nof the deceased under the age of eighteen years, then to such dependent\\nor dependents as defined in section sixteen of this chapter, as directed\\nby the board; and if there be no such dependents, then to the estate of\\nsuch deceased in an amount not exceeding reasonable funeral expenses as\\nprovided in subdivision one of section sixteen of this chapter, or, if\\nthere be no estate, to the person or persons paying the funeral expenses\\nof such deceased in an amount not exceeding reasonable funeral expenses\\nas provided in subdivision one of section sixteen of this chapter.\\n  An award for disability may be made after the death of the injured\\nemployee.\\n  4-a. Protracted temporary total disability in connection with\\npermanent partial disability. In case of temporary total disability and\\npermanent partial disability both resulting from the same injury, if the\\ntemporary total disability continues for a longer period than the number\\nof weeks set forth in the following schedule, the period of temporary\\ntotal disability in excess of such number of weeks shall be added to the\\ncompensation period provided in subdivision three of this section: Arm,\\nthirty-two weeks; leg, forty weeks; hand, thirty-two weeks; foot,\\nthirty-two weeks; ear, twenty-five weeks; eye, twenty weeks; thumb,\\ntwenty-four weeks; first finger, eighteen weeks; great toe, twelve\\nweeks; second finger, twelve weeks; third finger, eight weeks; fourth\\nfinger, eight weeks; toe other than great toe, eight weeks.\\n  In any case resulting in loss or partial loss of use of arm, leg,\\nhand, foot, ear, eye, thumb, finger or toe, where the temporary total\\ndisability does not extend beyond the periods above mentioned for such\\ninjury, compensation shall be limited to the schedule contained in\\nsubdivision three.\\n  5. Temporary partial disability. In case of temporary partial\\ndisability resulting in decrease of earning capacity, the compensation\\nshall be two-thirds of the difference between the injured employee's\\naverage weekly wages before the accident and his wage earning capacity\\nafter the accident in the same or other employment.\\n  5-a. Determination of wage earning capacity. The wage earning capacity\\nof an injured employee in cases of partial disability shall be\\ndetermined by his actual earnings, provided, however, that if he has no\\nsuch actual earnings the board may in the interest of justice fix such\\nwage earning capacity as shall be reasonable, but not in excess of\\nseventy-five per centum of his former full time actual earnings, having\\ndue regard to the nature of his injury and his physical impairment.\\n  5-b. Non-schedule adjustments. Notwithstanding any other provision of\\nthis chapter, in any case coming within the provisions of subdivisions\\nthree or five of this section, in which the right to compensation has\\nbeen established and compensation has been paid for not less than three\\nmonths, in which the continuance of disability and of future earning\\ncapacity cannot be ascertained with reasonable certainty, the board may,\\nin the interest of justice, approve a non-schedule adjustment agreed to\\nbetween the claimant and the employer or his insurance carrier. The\\nboard shall require, before approving any such agreement, that there be\\nan examination of the claimant in accordance with section nineteen of\\nthis chapter, and such approval shall only be given when it is found\\nthat the adjustment is fair and in the best interest of the claimant.\\nThe board may, in such case, order all future compensation to be paid in\\none or more lump sums or periodically, and any such adjustment shall be\\nregarded as a closing of the claim unless the board find upon proof that\\nthere has been a change in condition or in the degree of disability of\\nclaimant not found in the medical evidence and, therefore, not\\ncontemplated at the time of the adjustment.\\n  6. Maximum and minimum compensation for disability.  (a) Compensation\\nfor permanent or temporary total disability due to an accident or\\ndisablement resulting from an occupational disease that occurs, (1) on\\nor after January first, nineteen hundred seventy-eight, shall not exceed\\none hundred twenty-five dollars per week, that occurs (2) on or after\\nJuly first, nineteen hundred seventy-eight, shall not exceed one hundred\\neighty dollars per week, that occurs (3) on or after January first,\\nnineteen hundred seventy-nine, shall not exceed two hundred fifteen\\ndollars per week, that occurs (4) on or after July first, nineteen\\nhundred eighty-three, shall not exceed two hundred fifty-five dollars\\nper week, that occurs (5) on or after July first, nineteen hundred\\neighty-four, shall not exceed two hundred seventy-five dollars per week,\\nthat occurs (6) on or after July first, nineteen hundred eighty-five,\\nshall not exceed three hundred dollars per week, that occurs (7) on or\\nafter July first, nineteen hundred ninety, shall not exceed three\\nhundred forty dollars per week; and in the case of temporary total\\ndisability shall not be less than thirty dollars per week and in the\\ncase of permanent total disability shall not be less than twenty dollars\\nper week except that if the employee's wages at the time of injury are\\nless than thirty or twenty dollars per week respectively, he or she\\nshall receive his or her full weekly wages.

Within thirty days of January first, two thousand sixteen, all\\nemployers who were members of a closed group self-insured trust that was\\ninsolvent at the time the group was closed shall be subject to an\\nassessment under this section, except for those employers that: (1) have\\nentered into a settlement agreement or payment plan with the board under\\nwhich they have agreed to resolve all liabilities from the membership in\\nsuch trust, and remain current in their payments; (2) are members of a\\ngroup self-insurer that has transferred all of its liabilities\\ntransferred via a loss portfolio transfer; or (3) have paid all moneys\\nbilled them by the board at the time such assessment is due. For\\npurposes of this section, insolvent means the inability of a private\\ngroup self-insured trust to pay its outstanding lawful obligations under\\nthis chapter as they mature in the regular course of business, as may be\\nshown by: (i) the self-insurer being underfunded as defined in\\nsubdivision three-a of section fifty of this chapter; and (ii) the sum\\nof the group self-insured trust's assets, as defined by regulation of\\nthe chair, plus the available security deposit held by the chair\\npursuant to subdivision three-a of section fifty of this chapter and\\nregulation of the chair, being less than the total cost of all of the\\ngroup self-insured trust's anticipated workers' compensation\\nliabilities, as defined by board regulations, that will accrue within\\nthe succeeding six months. The total of such assessment shall be\\ndetermined by the percentage of the assessment levied on all employers\\nunder subdivision eight of section fifteen of this article in two\\nthousand ten that was levied on group self-insured trusts multiplied by\\nthe total amount of the employer's unpaid pro rata share of any deficit\\nowed by the closed group self-insured employer of which such employer\\nwas a member, as determined by the chair. The amount received on such\\nassessment shall be used as an offset against the assessments imposed on\\nother employers under subdivision eight of section fifteen of this\\narticle and section one hundred fifty-one of this chapter in the\\ncalendar year following the year in which it was received.\\n",

Notwithstanding any\\nother provision of this chapter to the contrary, in any instance in\\nwhich an employer is unsure of the extent of its liability for a claim\\nfor compensation by an injured employee pursuant to this chapter, such\\nemployer may initiate compensation payments and payments for prescribed\\nmedicine and continue such payments for one year, without prejudice and\\nwithout admitting liability, in accordance with a notice of temporary\\npayment of compensation, on a form prescribed by the board.\\n  2. The notice of temporary payment of compensation authorized by\\nsubdivision one of this section shall be delivered to the injured\\nemployee and the board. Such notice shall notify the injured employee\\nthat the temporary payment of compensation and prescribed medicine shall\\nnot be deemed to be an admission of liability by the employer for the\\ninjury or injuries to the employee. The board, upon receipt of a notice\\nof temporary payment of compensation, shall send a notice to the injured\\nemployee stating that:\\n  (a) the board has received a notice of temporary payment of\\ncompensation relating to such injured employee;\\n  (b) the payment of temporary compensation and prescribed medicine and\\nthe injured employee's acceptance of such temporary compensation and\\nprescribed medicine shall not be an admission of liability by the\\nemployer, nor prejudice the claim of the injured employee;\\n  (c) the payment of temporary compensation and prescribed medicine\\nshall terminate on the elapse of: one year, or the employer's contesting\\nof the injured employee's claim for compensation and prescribed\\nmedicine, or the board determination of the injured employee's claim,\\nwhichever is first; and\\n  (d) the injured employee may be required to enter into an agreement\\nwith the employer to ensure the continuation of payments of temporary\\ncompensation and prescribed medicine.\\n  3. An employer may cease making temporary payments of compensation and\\nprescribed medicine if such employer delivers within five days after the\\nlast payment, to the injured employee and the board, a notice of\\ntermination of temporary payments of compensation on a form prescribed\\nby the board.

An award or decision of the board shall be final and\\nconclusive upon all questions within its jurisdiction, as against the\\nstate fund or between the parties, unless reversed or modified on appeal\\ntherefrom as hereinafter provided. Any party may within thirty days\\nafter notice of the filing of an award or decision of a referee, file\\nwith the board an application in writing for a modification or\\nrescission or review of such award or decision, as provided in this\\nchapter. The board shall render its decision upon such application in\\nwriting and shall include in such decision a statement of the facts\\nwhich formed the basis of its action on the issues raised before it on\\nsuch application. Within thirty days after notice of the decision of the\\nboard upon such application has been served upon the parties, or within\\nthirty days after notice of an administrative redetermination review\\ndecision by the chair pursuant to subdivision five of section fifty-two,\\nsection one hundred thirty-one or section one hundred forty-one-a of\\nthis chapter has been served upon any party in interest, an appeal may\\nbe taken therefrom to the appellate division of the supreme court, third\\ndepartment, by any party in interest, including an employer insured in\\nthe state fund; provided, however, that any party in interest may within\\nthirty days after notice of the filing of the board panel's decision\\nwith the secretary of the board, make application in writing for review\\nthereof by the full board. If the decision or determination was that of\\na panel of the board and there was a dissent from such decision or\\ndetermination other than a dissent the sole basis of which is to refer\\nthe case to an impartial specialist, or if there was a decision or\\ndetermination by the panel which reduced the loss of wage earning\\ncapacity finding made by a compensation claims referee pursuant to\\nsubparagraph w of subdivision three of section fifteen of this article\\nfrom a percentage at or above the percentage set forth in subdivision\\nthree of section thirty-five of this article whereby a claimant would be\\neligible to apply for an extreme hardship redetermination to a\\npercentage below the threshold, the full board shall review and affirm,\\nmodify or rescind such decision or determination in the same manner as\\nherein above provided for an award or decision of a referee. If the\\ndecision or determination was that of a unanimous panel of the board, or\\nthere was a dissent from such decision or determination the sole basis\\nof which is to refer the case to an impartial specialist, the board may\\nin its sole discretion review and affirm, modify or rescind such\\ndecision or determination in the same manner as herein above provided\\nfor an award or decision of a referee. Failure to apply for review by\\nthe full board shall not bar any party in interest from taking an appeal\\ndirectly to the court as above provided. The board may also, in its\\ndiscretion certify to such appellate division of the supreme court,\\nquestions of law involved in its decision. Such appeals and the question\\nso certified shall be heard in a summary manner and shall have\\nprecedence over all other civil cases in such court. The board shall be\\ndeemed a party to every such appeal from its decision upon such\\napplication, and the chair shall be deemed a party to every such appeal\\nfrom an administrative redetermination review decision pursuant to\\nsubdivision five of section fifty-two of this chapter. The attorney\\ngeneral shall represent the board and the chair thereon. An appeal may\\nalso be taken to the court of appeals in the same manner and subject to\\nthe same limitations not inconsistent herewith as is now provided in the\\ncivil practice law and rules. It shall not be necessary to file\\nexceptions to the rulings of the board. An appeal to the appellate\\ndivision of the supreme court, third department, or to the court of\\nappeals, shall not operate as a stay of the payment of compensation\\nrequired by the terms of the award or of the payment of the cost of such\\nmedical, dental, surgical, optometric or other attendance, treatment,\\ndevices, apparatus or other necessary items the employer is required to\\nprovide pursuant to section thirteen of this article which are found to\\nbe fair and reasonable. Where such award is modified or rescinded upon\\nappeal, the appellant shall be entitled to reimbursement in a sum equal\\nto the compensation in dispute paid to the respondent in addition to a\\nsum equal to the cost of such medical, dental, surgical, optometric or\\nother attendance, treatment, devices, apparatus or other necessary items\\nthe employer is required to provide pursuant to section thirteen of this\\narticle paid by the appellant pending adjudication of the appeal. Such\\nreimbursement shall be paid from administration expenses as provided in\\nsection one hundred fifty-one of this chapter upon audit and warrant of\\nthe comptroller upon vouchers approved by the chair. Where such award is\\nsubject to the provisions of section twenty-seven of this article, the\\nappellant shall pay directly to the claimant all compensation as it\\nbecomes due during the pendency of the appeal, and upon affirmance shall\\nbe entitled to credit for such payments. Neither the chair, the board,\\nthe commissioners of the state insurance fund nor the claimant shall be\\nrequired to file a bond upon an appeal to the court of appeals. Upon\\nfinal determination of such an appeal, the board or chair, as the case\\nmay be, shall enter an order in accordance therewith. Whenever a notice\\nof appeal is served or an application made to the board by the employer\\nor insurance carrier for a modification or rescission or review of an\\naward or decision, and the board shall find that such notice of appeal\\nwas served or such application was made for the purpose of delay or upon\\nfrivolous grounds, the board shall impose a penalty in the amount of\\nfive hundred dollars upon the employer or insurance carrier, which\\npenalty shall be added to the compensation and paid to the claimant. The\\npenalties provided herein shall be collected in like manner as\\ncompensation. A party against whom an award of compensation shall be\\nmade may appeal from a part of such award. In such a case the payment of\\nsuch part of the award as is not appealed from shall not prejudice any\\nrights of such party on appeal, nor be taken as an admission against\\nsuch party. Any appeal by an employer from an administrative\\nredetermination review decision pursuant to subdivision five of section\\nfifty-two of this chapter shall in no way serve to relieve the employer\\nfrom the obligation to timely pay compensation and benefits otherwise\\npayable in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.\\n  Nothing contained in this section shall be construed to inhibit the\\ncontinuing jurisdiction of the board as provided in section one hundred\\ntwenty-three of this chapter.\\n",

When no controversy; penalties:\\nfailure to notify of cessation of payment; late payment of installment.\\n(a) The compensation herein provided for shall be paid periodically and\\npromptly in like manner as wages, and as it accrues, and directly to the\\nperson entitled thereto without waiting for an award by the board,\\nincluding those cases previously established and closed by the board\\nupon receipt of an application to reopen such case, except in those\\ncases in which the right to compensation is controverted by the\\nemployer.\\n  (b) The first payment of compensation shall become due on the\\nfourteenth day of disability on which date or within four days\\nthereafter all compensation then due shall be paid, and the compensation\\npayable bi-weekly thereafter; but the board may determine that any\\npayments may be made monthly or at any other period, as it may deem\\nadvisable. An award of compensation payable for permanent partial\\ndisability under paragraphs a through t, inclusive, of subdivision three\\nof section fifteen of this article, shall be payable in one lump sum,\\nwithout commutation to present value upon the request of the injured\\nemployee.\\n  (c) If the employer or insurance carrier does not controvert the\\ninjured worker's right to compensation such employer or insurance\\ncarrier shall, either on or before the eighteenth day after disability,\\nor within ten days after the employer first has knowledge of the alleged\\naccident, whichever period is the greater, begin paying compensation and\\nshall immediately notify the chair in accordance with a form to be\\nprescribed by him, that the payment of compensation has begun,\\naccompanied by the further statement that the employer or insurance\\ncarrier, as the case may be, will notify the chair when the payment of\\ncompensation has been stopped.\\n  (d) Whenever for any reason compensation payments cease, the employer\\nor its insurance carrier shall within sixteen days thereafter, send to\\nthe chair a notice on a form prescribed by the chair that such payment\\nhas been stopped, which notice shall contain the name of the injured\\nemployee or his or her principle dependent, the date of accident, the\\ndate to which compensation has been paid and the whole amount of\\ncompensation paid. In case the employer or its insurance carrier fails\\nso to notify the chair of the cessation of payments within sixteen days\\nafter the date on which compensation has been paid, the board may impose\\na penalty upon such employer or its insurance carrier in the amount of\\nthree hundred dollars, which shall be paid to the claimant. Such penalty\\nshall be collected in like manner as an award of compensation.\\n  (e) If the employer or insurance carrier shall fail to pay any\\ninstallments of compensation within twenty-five days after the same\\nbecome due, there shall be paid by the employer or, if insured, its\\ninsurance carrier, an additional amount of twenty percent of the\\ncompensation then due which shall accrue for the benefit of the injured\\nworker or his or her dependents and shall be paid to him or her or them\\nwith the compensation, unless such delay or default is excused by the\\nboard upon the application of the employer or insurance carrier upon the\\nground that owing to conditions over which the employer or insurance\\ncarrier had no control, such payment could not be made. The employer in\\neach such instance shall also be assessed the sum of three hundred\\ndollars, which shall be paid to the claimant.\\n  (f) Whenever compensation is withheld solely because a controversy\\nexists on the question of liability as between insurance carriers,\\nsurety companies, the special disability fund, the special fund for\\nreopened cases, or an employer, the board may direct that any carrier,\\nsurety company, the special disability fund, the special fund for\\nreopened cases shall immediately pay compensation and bills for medical\\ncare to the extent payable in accordance with sections thirteen-g,\\nthirteen-k, thirteen-l and thirteen-m of this chapter, pending\\ndetermination of such issue. Any such payment or payments shall not be\\ndeemed an admission against interest by the carrier, surety company,\\nspecial disability fund or the special fund for reopened cases. After\\nfinal determination, the parties shall make the necessary and proper\\nreimbursement including the payment of simple interest at the rate\\nestablished by section five thousand four of the civil practice law and\\nrules in conformity with such determination.\\n  2. Procedure when compensation controverted; penalties: late filing;\\ncontroversy without just cause.  (a) In case the employer decides to\\ncontrovert the right to compensation, it shall, either on or before the\\neighteenth day after disability or within ten days after it has\\nknowledge of the alleged accident, whichever period is the greater, file\\na notice with the chair, on a form prescribed by the chair, that\\ncompensation is not being paid, giving the name of the claimant, name of\\nthe employer, date of the alleged accident and the reason why\\ncompensation is not being paid. When a claim for compensation is filed\\nwith medical evidence of work related injury or illness, and the\\nclaimant is disabled and not working, and the claimant is otherwise\\nentitled to compensation, and the employer is not making payment to the\\nclaimant as required herein, and the employer has not controverted the\\nclaim, and the efforts to resolve the issue with the carrier have not\\nbeen successful, the claimant may request, in the format prescribed by\\nthe chair, a hearing to be held within forty-five days of the board's\\nreceipt of such request.\\n  If the insurance carrier shall fail either to file notice of\\ncontroversy or begin payment of compensation within the prescribed\\nperiod or within ten days after receipt of a copy of the notice required\\nin section one hundred ten of this chapter, whichever period is the\\ngreater, the board may impose a penalty in the amount of three hundred\\ndollars, which shall be in addition to all other penalties provided for\\nin this chapter and shall be paid to the claimant. Such penalty shall be\\ncollected in like manner as an award of compensation.\\n  (b) In the event the board shall notify an employer or his insurance\\ncarrier that a workers' compensation case has been indexed against such\\nemployer, and the employer or insurance carrier decides to controvert\\nthe right to compensation, a notice of controversy shall be filed with\\nthe chair within twenty-five days from the date of mailing of a notice\\nthat the case has been indexed. Failure to file the notice of\\ncontroversy within the prescribed twenty-five day time limit shall bar\\nthe employer and its insurance carrier from pleading that the injured\\nperson was not at the time of the accident an employee of the employer,\\nor that the employee did not sustain an accidental injury, or that the\\ninjury did not arise out of and in the course of the employment.\\nHowever, the board, in the interest of justice, shall, upon the showing\\nof good cause therefor, permit the filing or the amendment of a notice\\nof controversy to raise an issue not theretofore raised because of\\nmistake, inadvertence, omission, irregularity, defect or surprise, or\\nbased upon newly discovered evidence.\\n  (c) If the board shall upon a hearing determine that objections to an\\naward of compensation by the employer or insurance carrier were\\ninterposed without just cause, it shall state the grounds for such\\ndetermination and shall require the employer or the insurance carrier to\\npay to the claimant, in addition to the amount presently due under the\\naward, the sum of three hundred dollars.\\n  2-a. Pre-hearing conference.  (a) In any controverted case, upon\\nreceipt of the notice of controversy, the board shall schedule a\\npre-hearing conference before a referee or conciliator as soon as\\npracticable but not to exceed forty-five days after receipt of notice of\\ncontroversy and a medical report referencing an injury. The board shall\\ngive notice of the pre-hearing conference to all parties. A party may\\nappear at such conference pro se, or by an attorney or licensed\\nrepresentative or other representative authorized by the board to appear\\non behalf of such party.\\n  (b) The purpose of the conference shall be to consider the following:\\n  (i) confirmation that all appropriate forms, including medical\\nreports, have been submitted and a verification that all information on\\nthe forms is accurate;\\n  (ii) addition of any other necessary parties, where appropriate;\\n  (iii) simplification and limitation of factual and legal issues, where\\nappropriate;\\n  (iv) presentation of a list of proposed witnesses, where appropriate;\\n  (v) scheduling the case for a hearing; and\\n  (vi) entering into a stipulation.\\n  (c) The referee or conciliator may continue the conference and order\\nthe production of any necessary reports, including, where appropriate,\\nan examination by a carrier's consultant. At the conclusion of the\\nconference, the referee or conciliator may issue a written order. The\\nreferee or conciliator may, upon agreement of all parties, issue a\\ndecision which shall constitute a decision of the board for all\\npurposes. If a claimant shall be unrepresented, a decision issued by a\\nreferee upon agreement of all parties at a pre-hearing conference shall\\nnot become final until it shall have reviewed and approved by the chair\\nor a referee of the board designated by the chair. Such review by the\\nchair or an employee of the board so designated shall occur no later\\nthan fourteen days from the date the proposed decision is submitted for\\nreview and approval. The unrepresented claimant shall have ten days from\\nreceipt of notice of such approval to withdraw from the agreement. If\\nnot withdrawn, such agreement shall constitute an award of the board for\\nall purposes. Upon receipt of written notification of such withdrawal by\\nthe unrepresented claimant, the board shall rescind the decision made by\\nthe referee and restore the case to the regular hearing calendar\\nprocess. Such decision shall constitute a decision of the board for the\\npurposes of section twenty-three of this article.\\n  (d) In cases where the claimant is represented by an attorney or a\\nlicensed representative, ten days before the conference, each party\\nshall file a conference statement noting the specific issues in dispute,\\nincluding the information required in paragraph (b) of this subdivision.\\nDiscovery shall close at the end of the pre-hearing conference. Evidence\\nnot disclosed or obtained thereafter shall not be admissible unless the\\nproponent of the evidence can demonstrate that it was not available or\\ncould not have been discovered by the exercise of due diligence prior to\\nthe conference. If a claimant is unrepresented, the carrier shall file\\nsuch a statement.\\n  (e) Proceedings in the pre-hearing part shall be conducted in\\naccordance with the rules promulgated by the chair or the board.\\n  2-b. Conciliation. (a) 1. There is hereby created within the board a\\nconciliation process. The conciliation process will permit claims to be\\nhandled on a more expeditious and informal basis and provide a mechanism\\nfor claims to be addressed without undue controversy.\\n  2. Conciliation may also address requests by hospitals, physicians or\\nother health care providers for payment of bills rendered by them in any\\ncase, regardless of the expected duration of benefits, pursuant to\\nsections thirteen-g, thirteen-k, thirteen-l and thirteen-m of this\\narticle, and regardless of the dollar amount of the bill.\\n  (b) Each claim that is filed shall be reviewed for possible transfer\\nfor conciliation. Claims where the expected duration of benefits is\\nfifty-two weeks or less shall be transferred for conciliation within\\nthirty days of receipt of a carrier's response to notice of index\\nrequired under this section, except uncontested claims where there have\\nbeen only temporary or minor injuries and where board appearance by the\\nclaimant is unnecessary. Such minor and uncontested claims shall be\\nhandled through a motion calendar as prescribed by the rules and\\nregulations promulgated pursuant to this section.\\n  (c) Upon receipt of a claim for conciliation, a meeting shall be\\nscheduled, if necessary, within thirty days with all concerned parties\\nbefore a conciliation counsel.\\n  (d) All information relative to the claim shall be made available to\\nall parties no later than five days before the meeting. This information\\nshall include, but not be limited to medical records, wage information,\\ndate of accident or injury and the amount of time lost from work as a\\nresult of such accident or injury.\\n  (e) At such meeting the conciliation counsel shall promptly and prior\\nto any other proceeding authorized under this section inform any\\nclaimant participating in the meeting without benefit of a counsel or\\nlicensed representative of their right to have representation present,\\ntheir right to a reasonable adjournment to procure representation, of\\ntheir right to withdraw from any agreement at such meeting in accordance\\nwith subdivision (g) of this section and such other and further\\ninformation as the chair may require to insure that an uncounselled\\nclaimant fully understands the conciliation process. After informing\\nclaimant in accordance with this subdivision, conciliation counsel shall\\nrequest a written consent to participate in the conciliation process\\nfrom claimant, and if such claimant declines to continue, shall\\nimmediately cease the conciliation process and cause the claim to be\\nrestored to the regular hearing calendar process.\\n  (f) After reviewing all relevant information, conciliation counsel\\nshall prepare a proposed decision which shall be sent to all parties.\\nAny party may object to the proposed decision and request a hearing\\nwithin thirty days of the receipt of the proposed decision. If no\\nobjection is made during such thirty day period the proposed decision\\nshall constitute a final award of the board for all purposes except that\\nit shall not be reviewable under sections twenty-two and twenty-three of\\nthis article. If any party objects to the proposed decision, the case\\nshall be transferred to the regular hearing calendar process.\\n  (g) If a claimant shall be unrepresented, the case shall not be agreed\\nto until it shall have been reviewed and approved by the chair or a\\nreferee of the board designated by the chair. Such decision shall be\\nrendered within fifteen days of receipt of the agreement from the\\nconciliation bureau; provided, however, that a claimant shall have ten\\ndays from receipt of notice of such approval to withdraw from the\\nagreement. If approved, such agreement shall constitute an award of the\\nboard for all purposes except that it shall not be reviewable under\\nsections twenty-two and twenty-three of this article. Should the\\nagreement be disapproved or should the claimant withdraw from the\\nagreement as provided herein, the case shall be transferred to the\\nregular hearing calendar process.\\n  (h) After the proposed decision has become final, the carrier shall\\nmake payments of any award as required in the decision within ten days.\\nIf, however, the carrier does not make the payments as required in the\\ndecision within ten days of the date in which the proposed decision\\nbecomes final, the chair shall impose of a fine of five hundred dollars\\nfor failure to live up to the terms of the decision upon verification\\nthat payment has not been timely made. Of that amount, three hundred\\ndollars shall be made payable to the claimant and two hundred dollars\\nshall be payable to the board for the operation and administration of\\nthis chapter.\\n  (i) If, in any case which has been addressed by conciliation, the\\nclaimant requires additional medical care beyond that agreed to or\\nrequires benefit payments beyond that agreed to, the meeting, if\\nnecessary, shall be reconvened within thirty days from the receipt of\\ninformation demonstrating the need for additional medical care or\\nbenefit payments. If it is determined that the claimant's condition may\\ncontinue for a period of time which is more than six months, such case\\nshall be reopened and transferred to the regular hearing calendar. If,\\nhowever, it is determined, based on medical evidence, that the\\nclaimant's condition will improve in less than six months, the case\\nshall remain in conciliation.\\n  2-c. Collective bargaining; alternative dispute resolution. (a) For\\nthe purposes of employments classified under sections two hundred\\ntwenty, two hundred forty and two hundred forty-one of the labor law, an\\nemployer and a recognized or certified exclusive bargaining\\nrepresentative of its employees may include within their collective\\nbargaining agreement provisions to establish an alternative dispute\\nresolution system to resolve claims arising under this chapter.\\n  Any collective bargaining agreement or agreement entered into by the\\nemployee and an employer which purports to preempt any provision of this\\nchapter or in any way diminishes or changes rights and benefits provided\\nunder this chapter, except as expressly provided herein, shall be null,\\nvoid and unenforceable.\\n  (b) Except as specifically provided in this subdivision, nothing in\\nthis section or any collective bargaining agreement providing for an\\nalternative dispute resolution system for the resolution of claims\\narising under this chapter shall preempt any provision of this chapter\\nor in any way diminish or change any benefits to which an employee, or\\nhis or her dependents, or survivors may be entitled pursuant to the\\nprovisions of this chapter.\\n  (c) The collective bargaining agreement may establish the following\\nobligations and procedures:\\n  (i) an alternative dispute resolution process to resolve claims\\narising under this chapter, which may include but is not limited to\\nmediation or arbitration;\\n  (ii) the use of an agreed managed care organization as defined in\\nsection one hundred twenty-six of this chapter or a list of authorized\\nproviders for medical treatment, which may be the exclusive source of\\nall medical and related treatment provided under this chapter;\\n  (iii) the use of an agreed list of authorized providers for the\\npurpose of providing medical opinions and testimony, which may be the\\nexclusive source of all such medical opinions and testimony under this\\nchapter;\\n  (iv) benefits for injured workers, their dependents or their survivors\\nsupplemental to those provided under this chapter;\\n  (v) a light duty, modified job, or return to work program;\\n  (vi) a vocational rehabilitation or retraining program; and\\n  (vii) worker injury and illness prevention programs and procedures.\\n  (d) The determination of an arbitrator or mediator pursuant to an\\nalternative dispute resolution procedure pertaining to the resolution of\\nclaims arising under this chapter shall not be reviewable by the\\nworkers' compensation board, and the venue for any appeal shall be to a\\ncourt of competent jurisdiction in accordance with section twenty-three\\nof this chapter.\\n  (e) (i) Determinations rendered as a result of an alternative dispute\\nresolution procedure shall remain in force during a period in which the\\nemployer and a recognized or certified exclusive bargaining\\nrepresentative are renegotiating a collective bargaining agreement.\\n  (ii) Upon the expiration of a collective bargaining agreement which\\ncontains a provision for an alternative dispute resolution procedure for\\nworkers' compensation claims, the resolution of claims relating to\\ninjuries sustained as a result of a work-related accident or\\noccupational disease may, if the collective bargaining agreement so\\nprovides, be subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the\\nexpired collective bargaining agreement until the employer and a\\nrecognized or certified exclusive bargaining representative negotiate a\\nnew collective bargaining agreement.\\n  (iii) Upon the termination of a collective bargaining agreement which\\nis not subject to renegotiation, the employer and its employees shall\\nbecome fully subject to the provisions of this chapter to the same\\nextent as they were prior to the implementation of the collective\\nbargaining agreement provided, however, that when a claim has been\\nadjudicated under the alternative dispute resolution procedure, the\\nclaimant or employer to such claim or matter shall be estopped from\\nraising identical issues before the board.\\n  (f) Commencing January first, nineteen hundred ninety-six, and\\nannually thereafter, a copy of the collective bargaining agreement shall\\nbe filed with the chair. The employer shall report the number of\\nemployees subject to the collective bargaining agreement. The chair or\\nthe chair's designee shall review the collective bargaining agreements\\nfor compliance with the provisions of this section, shall notify the\\nparties to the agreement if the agreement is not in compliance, and\\nshall recommend appropriate action to bring the agreement into\\ncompliance.\\n  3.

(a) The chairman may in the interest of justice at any time\\nrefer a case in which payments are being made as above to the board for\\na hearing, and shall immediately upon receipt of notice from the injured\\nworker, from the employer, or from the insurance carrier that the\\nemployee's right to compensation is controverted, or that payments of\\ncompensation have stopped or been suspended, make such investigations,\\nor cause such medical examinations to be made, or refer the case for\\nsuch hearings, as will properly protect the rights of both parties,\\neither as to any compensation then due or as to any compensation that\\nmay become due in the future for temporary or permanent disability, and\\nshall promptly cause the resumption of payments in case the injured\\nperson is entitled thereto.\\n  (b) Nothing herein shall limit the right of the board in a particular\\ncase to hold a hearing and make an award in accordance with other\\nprovisions of this chapter. No case shall be closed without notice to\\nall parties interested and without giving to all such parties an\\nopportunity to be heard.\\n  (c) The board shall keep an accurate record of all hearings held.\\nWhenever a hearing must be continued or adjourned because the carrier or\\nemployer has engaged in dilatory tactics or exhibited unjustified lack\\nof preparedness, the board shall impose a penalty of twenty-five dollars\\nto be paid to the fund created by subdivision two of section one hundred\\nfifty-one of this chapter and shall in addition make an award of\\nseventy-five dollars payable to the injured worker or his or her\\ndependants.

An adjourned case shall be rescheduled as soon as\\npracticable, but no later than thirty days following such adjournment.\\n  If a request for an adjournment is made by a carrier or employer which\\nis not an emergency and is deemed to be frivolous by the chair, a\\npenalty of one thousand dollars shall be imposed by the chair. If such\\nemployer or carrier is represented by an attorney or licensed\\nrepresentative who is not an employee of the carrier or employer, the\\nattorney or licensed representative shall be responsible for the payment\\nof such penalty. If a request for an adjournment is made by a claimant\\nwho is represented by an attorney or a licensed representative which is\\nnot an emergency and is deemed to be frivolous by the chair, a penalty\\nof five hundred dollars shall be imposed by the chair on the attorney or\\nlicensed representative.

The penalty or\\nassessment imposed in the aggregate shall be payable to the chair. Such\\naggregate penalty or assessment shall be based upon the number of\\nviolations as multiplied against the applicable penalty or assessment,\\nbut may be negotiated by the chair's designee in full satisfaction of\\nthe penalty or assessment.

Any aggregate penalty or assessment issued herein shall\\nbe issued administratively, and the board, and the chair may, by\\nregulation, specify the method of review or redetermination, and the\\npresentment of evidence and objections shall occur solely upon the\\ndocumentation. The carrier or self-insured employer shall receive credit\\nfor any instances in which the aggregate penalty or assessment is\\ninclusive of a penalty or assessment previously issued and paid in an\\nindividual claim or proceeding. A final determination is subject to\\nreview under section twenty-three of this article, except that no stay\\nin payment of the penalty or assessment shall apply pending the outcome\\nof the application for administrative review. Failure to pay the finally\\ndetermined penalty or assessment, or the penalty or assessment agreed\\nupon pursuant to section thirty-two of this article, within ten days of\\nfiling, shall result in the imposition of a twenty-percent penalty,\\npayable to the chair. In the event of the carrier or self-insured\\nemployer instituting or continuing an issue without reasonable grounds,\\nthe provisions of subdivision three of section one hundred fourteen-a of\\nthis chapter shall be applicable. Aggregate penalties shall be borne\\nexclusively by insurance carriers and licensed representatives pursuant\\nto subdivision three-b of section fifty of this article and the costs\\nshall not be passed to insured employers.\\n  4.

Where such award is\\nreduced or rescinded upon appeal, the uninsured employer or the fund,\\nwhichever made payment, shall be entitled to reimbursement in a sum\\nequal to the compensation in dispute paid by such party to the\\nrespondent pending adjudication of the appeal, and, if the claim for\\nworkers' compensation is disallowed, to a sum equal to the amount of the\\ndoctor's bills paid by such party pending adjudication of the appeal.\\nSuch reimbursement shall be paid from administration expenses as\\nprovided in section one hundred fifty-one of this chapter upon vouchers\\napproved by the chair. To the extent of any reimbursement to the fund,\\nthe uninsured employer shall be entitled to reimbursement from the fund\\nfor payments made into the fund in accordance with subdivision one of\\nthis section.\\n  7.

If the employer has also paid compensation to or on behalf of\\nthe injured employee or his dependents in such case any recovery by the\\nfund pursuant to subdivision one of section twenty-nine shall first be\\napplied to repayment of any awards paid by the fund to or on behalf of\\nthe injured employee or his dependents in such case, the balance then\\napplied to any outstanding unsatisfied demand for security in said case\\nand assessments imposed against the employer pursuant to the provisions\\nof this section, the remainder, if any, to be returned to the employer.\\nIf the employer has also paid compensation to or on behalf of the\\ninjured employee or his dependents in such case, that portion, if any,\\nof a recovery by the fund pursuant to subdivision two of section\\ntwenty-nine which is in excess of the total amount of compensation\\nawarded to or on behalf of such injured employee or his dependents and\\nthe reasonable and necessary expenditures incurred in effecting such\\nrecovery shall be apportioned between the injured employee or his\\ndependents and the fund in the manner provided in said subdivision two.\\nThe balance of said recovery shall first be applied to reimburse the\\nfund for its reasonable and necessary expenditures in effecting such\\nrecovery and the remainder shall be applied to repayment of any award\\npaid by the fund to or on behalf of the injured employee or his\\ndependents in such case. If there still remains a balance it shall first\\nbe applied to the outstanding unsatisfied demand for security, if any,\\nin said case and assessments, if any, imposed against the employer\\npursuant to the provisions of this section; the remainder, if any, to be\\nreturned to the employer.\\n  7-a. Notwithstanding any other provision of section twenty-nine of\\nthis article to the contrary, a compromise by the claimant of his or her\\ncause of action as set forth in said section twenty-nine of this\\narticle, in an amount less than the sum paid to or on behalf of the\\nclaimant from the uninsured employers' fund, shall be made only with the\\nwritten consent of the chair.\\n  8.

The liability of the chairman, the commissioner of taxation and\\nfinance, the fund and the state of New York with respect to payment of\\nany compensation, benefits, expenses, fees or disbursements properly\\nchargeable against the uninsured employers' fund shall be limited to the\\nassets in said fund and they shall not otherwise in any way or manner be\\nliable for the making of any such payment.\\n  11. All assessments payable pursuant to the provisions of this section\\nshall be liens against the assets of the employer liable therefor\\nwithout limit of amount, subordinate, however, to claims for unpaid\\nwages and prior recorded liens.\\n  12.

All\\npayments made into the fund pursuant to the provisions of this section\\nshall constitute an indivisible and aggregate trust fund except as\\nhereinafter provided.\\n  2. If an award under this chapter requires payment of death benefits\\nor other compensation by an insurance carrier or employer in periodical\\npayments, the board may, in its discretion, at any time, any provision\\nof this chapter to the contrary notwithstanding, compute and permit or\\nrequire to be paid into the aggregate trust fund an amount equal to the\\npresent value of all unpaid death benefits or other compensation in\\ncases in which awards are made for total permanent or permanent partial\\ndisability for a period of one hundred and four weeks or more, for which\\nliability exists, together with such additional sum as the board may\\ndeem necessary for a proportionate payment of expenses of administering\\nthe fund so created, including the cost of the actuarial computation by\\nor on behalf of the board of the present value of the award, and for the\\npurposes of this section such cases shall be known as discretionary type\\ncases. If any such award made on or after July first, nineteen hundred\\nthirty-five, requires payment for total permanent disability resulting\\nfrom the loss of both hands, or both arms, or both feet, or both legs,\\nor both eyes, or of any two thereof, or for permanent partial disability\\nresulting from loss of an arm, leg, hand, foot or eye, or of death\\nbenefits by an insurance carrier which is a stock corporation or mutual\\nassociation, or if any such award made on or after July first, two\\nthousand seven requires payment for permanent partial disability under\\nparagraph w of subdivision three of section fifteen of this article by\\nan insurance carrier which is a stock corporation or mutual association,\\nwhich for the purposes of this section shall be known as mandatory type\\ncases, the board shall immediately compute the present value thereof and\\nrequire payment of such amount into the aggregate trust fund, together\\nwith such additional sum as the board may deem necessary for a\\nproportionate payment of expenses of administering such trust fund\\nincluding the cost of the actuarial computation by or on behalf of the\\nboard of the present value of the award provided, however, that where an\\nemployer or his insurance carrier is found to be entitled to\\nreimbursement from the special disability fund of subdivision eight of\\nsection fifteen, the computation of the present value of the award and\\nthe requirement for payment of such amount into the said trust fund\\nshall not be mandatory and such cases shall be deemed to be\\ndiscretionary type cases; further provided that where an employee\\nentitled to compensation under this chapter be injured or killed by the\\nnegligence or wrong of another not in the same employ, the computation\\nof the present value and the requirement for payment of such amount into\\nthe said trust fund shall be held in abeyance until (1) six months have\\nelapsed from the award of compensation, or in any event not more than\\none year after the date of the accident, if the injured employee, or in\\ncase of death, his personal representatives, spouse, parents, dependents\\nor next of kin, or anyone otherwise entitled to recover damages at\\ncommon law or otherwise, on account of such injury or death, have failed\\nto commence such action, (2) the termination of any such action brought\\nby the injured employee, or in case of death, his personal\\nrepresentatives, spouse, parents, dependents or next of kin, or anyone\\notherwise entitled to recover damages, at common law or otherwise, on\\naccount of such injury or death, under the provisions of section\\ntwenty-nine of this article.\\n  3. Upon payment by an employer or insurance carrier into the aggregate\\ntrust fund of an amount equal to the present value of all unpaid death\\nbenefits or other compensation under any such award together with such\\nadditional sum as the board may deem necessary for a proportionate\\npayment of expenses of administering such trust fund including the cost\\nof the actuarial computation by or on behalf of the board of the present\\nvalue of the award, such employer or insurance carrier shall be\\ndischarged from any further liability for payment of such death benefits\\nor other compensation, and payment of the same as provided by this\\nchapter shall be assumed by the fund so created.\\n  4. In the event of a review or appeal of any such award the value of\\nwhich has not been paid into the aggregate trust fund, if the amount of\\naward is modified or changed, the employer or insurance carrier shall\\npay directly to the claimant compensation due to the date as of which\\nthe present value of future benefits is payable into such fund, and to\\nthe said fund the present value of future benefits, but if the original\\naward is affirmed, the employer or insurance carrier shall pay to such\\nfund the present value of the award computed as of the effective date of\\nthe original award and simple interest on such amount at the industry\\nstandard rate, as determined by the superintendent of financial services\\nby regulation, computed from the date of the original award to the date\\nthat payment is made into such fund, plus simple interest at the rate\\nprovided in section five thousand four of the civil practice law and\\nrules, on past due payments of compensation to the date of the\\naffirmance of such award, which past due payment and interest shall be\\nmade directly to the claimant. The foregoing provision shall apply in\\nthe event of such review or appeal regardless of whether the widow or\\nwidower or other parties in interest have died or the widow or widower\\nremarried subsequent to the date as of which the present value of the\\noriginal award was computed. If any award, the present value of which\\nhas been paid into the aggregate trust fund, is subsequently modified or\\nchanged by the board for any reason other than because of subsequent\\ndeath or remarriage, the amount equal to the present value of the unpaid\\ndeath benefits or other compensation at the effective date of such\\nmodification or change shall be computed on the basis both of the\\noriginal award and of the modified or changed award. If such amount is\\ngreater on the basis of the original award, the difference shall be paid\\nby said trust fund to the employer or insurance carrier minus the cost,\\nif any, of the actuarial computation made by or on behalf of the board.\\nIf such amount is greater on the basis of the modified or changed award,\\nthe difference shall be paid to said trust fund by such employer or\\ninsurance carrier in addition to the cost, if any, of the actuarial\\ncomputation made by or on behalf of the board. In the case of an\\naccident, occurring on or subsequent to July first, nineteen hundred\\nthirty-nine, where the present value of an award for permanent total or\\npermanent partial disability other than award for a definite number of\\nweeks has been paid into the aggregate trust fund, if an award is made\\nfor death resulting from the injury causing the said disability, the\\nemployer or insurance carrier which paid the present value of said\\ndisability award into such fund shall be entitled to the difference\\nbetween the amount paid into such fund and the sum disbursed from such\\nfund to the injured employee prior to his or her death, plus simple\\ninterest on such difference at the industry standard rate. In the case\\nof an accident occurring on or subsequent to July first, nineteen\\nhundred thirty-nine, where the present value of an award for permanent\\npartial disability for a definite number of weeks has been paid into the\\naggregate trust fund, if the injured employee dies prior to the end of\\nsuch definite number of weeks, the employer or insurance carrier which\\nmade the said payment into such fund shall be entitled to the present\\nvalue of the unexpended disability benefits not payable to beneficiaries\\ncomputed on the basis of annuities certain with interest at the industry\\nstandard rate, minus however the cost, if any, of the actuarial\\ncomputation made by or on behalf of the board. In the case of a claim\\nfor the death of an employee resulting from an accident occurring on or\\nsubsequent to January first, two thousand one, the present value of an\\naward paid into the aggregate trust fund shall be calculated based on\\nthe assumption that any child while under the age of twenty-three years\\nwill be enrolled and attending as a full time student in an accredited\\neducational institution and would thereby be entitled to benefits for\\nall periods while under the age of twenty-three years. After all such\\nchildren reach the age of twenty-three, the aggregate trust fund shall\\nrefund to the carrier which paid such present value into such fund the\\nportion of such present value representing benefits for which such\\nchildren were not actually entitled because they were not enrolled and\\nattending as a full time student in an accredited educational\\ninstitution plus simple interest on such difference at the industry\\nstandard rate.\\n  5. All computations made by the board shall be upon the basis of the\\nsurvivorship annuitants table of mortality, the remarriage tables of the\\nDutch Royal Insurance Institution and interest at three and one-half per\\ncentum per annum on claims based on accidents occurring up to and\\nincluding June thirtieth, nineteen hundred thirty-nine, at three per\\ncentum per annum on claims based on accidents occurring from July first,\\nnineteen hundred thirty-nine up to and including August thirty-first,\\nnineteen hundred eighty-three, at six per centum per annum on claims\\nbased on accidents occurring from September first, nineteen hundred\\neighty-three up to and including December thirty-first, two thousand and\\nat the industry standard rate on claims based on accidents occurring\\nthereafter, except (a) that computations of present values of death\\nbenefits required to be paid into the aggregate trust fund by an\\ninsurance carrier which is a stock corporation or a mutual association\\nshall be based, in the case of a dependent parent, grandparent, blind or\\nphysically disabled child or spouse, upon said table of mortality\\ndisregarding possible change in or termination of dependency, with\\ninterest at three and one-half per centum per annum on claims based on\\naccidents occurring up to and including June thirtieth, nineteen hundred\\nthirty-nine, at three per centum per annum on claims based on accidents\\noccurring from July first, nineteen hundred thirty-nine up to and\\nincluding August thirty-first, nineteen hundred eighty-three, at six per\\ncentum per annum on claims based on accidents occurring from September\\nfirst, nineteen hundred eighty-three up to and including December\\nthirty-first, two thousand and at the industry standard rate on claims\\nbased on accidents occurring thereafter and (b) that computations of\\npresent values of permanent partial disability benefits awarded for a\\ndefinite number of weeks shall be on the basis of annuities certain with\\ninterest at three and one-half per centum per annum on claims based on\\naccidents occurring up to and including June thirtieth, nineteen hundred\\nthirty-nine, at three per centum per annum on claims based on accidents\\noccurring from July first, nineteen hundred thirty-nine up to and\\nincluding August thirty-first, nineteen hundred eighty-three, at six per\\ncentum per annum on claims based on accidents occurring from September\\nfirst, nineteen hundred eighty-three up to and including December\\nthirty-first, two thousand and at the industry standard rate on claims\\nbased on accidents occurring thereafter.\\n  6. Such aggregate trust fund shall be kept separate and apart from all\\nother moneys of the state insurance fund, and shall not be liable for\\nany losses or expenses of administration of the state insurance fund\\nother than the expenses involved in the administration of such trust\\nfund including the cost, if any, of the actuarial computations made on\\nbehalf of the board, nor shall the state insurance fund be charged with\\nthe losses or expenses of the aggregate trust fund beyond the amount of\\nsuch trust fund. Any portion of such aggregate trust fund may, by order\\nof the commissioners of the state insurance fund, approved by the\\nsuperintendent of financial services, be invested in or loaned on the\\npledge of the same securities as provided in section eighty-seven of\\nthis chapter for the investment of the state insurance fund, and the\\ncommissioners may, upon like approval of the superintendent of financial\\nservices, also sell any such securities. Any securities belonging to the\\naggregate trust fund may be loaned by the commissioners of the state\\ninsurance fund, with the approval of the superintendent of financial\\nservices, under a security loan agreement as provided by section\\neighty-seven of this chapter for securities belonging to the state\\ninsurance fund.\\n  7. For the purpose of securing the solvency of the aggregate trust\\nfund, there shall be required, in addition to the payments hereinbefore\\nprovided for, a payment on each award, as follows:\\n  (a) In the mandatory type cases based on an accident occurring on or\\nsubsequent to July first, nineteen hundred forty-one up to and including\\nJune thirtieth, nineteen hundred forty-three an amount equal to six per\\ncentum of the present value of each such case paid into such fund;\\n  (b) In the mandatory type cases based on an accident occurring on or\\nsubsequent to July first, nineteen hundred forty-three an amount equal\\nto ten per centum of the present value of each such case paid into such\\nfund;\\n  (c) In the discretionary type cases based on an accident occurring up\\nto and including June thirtieth, nineteen hundred thirty-nine an amount\\nequal to sixteen per centum of the present value of each such case paid\\ninto such fund;\\n  (d) In the discretionary type cases based on an accident occurring on\\nor subsequent to July first, nineteen hundred thirty-nine an amount\\nequal to ten per centum of the present value of each such case paid into\\nsuch fund.\\n  Such additional payments shall be required until the surplus of the\\nfund equals or exceeds one per centum of the total outstanding loss\\nreserves as shown by three successive annual reports of the fund to the\\nsuperintendent of financial services and such additional payment shall\\nbe required as a payment upon each award based on an accident occurring\\nprior to July first next succeeding the third such annual report, but\\nnot as a payment upon any award based on an accident occurring on or\\nafter said July first; provided, however, that if and when the surplus\\nof the fund as shown by any annual report thereafter shall be less than\\none per centum of the total outstanding loss reserves, then the\\nadditional payments as provided in paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (d) of\\nthis subdivision shall be resumed and shall be payable upon any award\\nbased on an accident occurring on or after July first next succeeding\\nthe close of the year for which such annual report is made. Thereafter,\\nthe suspension or resumption of additional payments as required by this\\nsubdivision shall be governed by the foregoing provisions. Such loss\\nreserves shall be computed based upon the tables specified in\\nsubdivision five of this section and interest at a standard to be\\ndetermined by the superintendent of financial services by regulation.\\n  8. In the case of a claim concerning which the aggregate trust fund\\nenters a waiver agreement pursuant to section thirty-two of this\\narticle, the insurance carrier, as defined in subdivision twelve of\\nsection two of this chapter, which paid the present value of the award\\nfor such claim, shall not be entitled to a refund of any portion of the\\npresent value of such award.\\n",

If an employee entitled\\nto compensation under this chapter be injured or killed by the\\nnegligence or wrong of another not in the same employ, such injured\\nemployee, or in case of death, his dependents, need not elect whether to\\ntake compensation and medical benefits under this chapter or to pursue\\nhis remedy against such other but may take such compensation and medical\\nbenefits and at any time either prior thereto or within six months after\\nthe awarding of compensation or within nine months after the enactment\\nof a law or laws creating, establishing or affording a new or additional\\nremedy or remedies, pursue his remedy against such other subject to the\\nprovisions of this chapter. If such injured employee, or in case of\\ndeath, his dependents, take or intend to take compensation, and medical\\nbenefits in the case of an employee, under this chapter and desire to\\nbring action against such other, such action must be commenced not later\\nthan six months after the awarding of compensation or not later than\\nnine months after the enactment of such law or laws creating,\\nestablishing or affording a new or additional remedy or remedies and in\\nany event before the expiration of one year from the date such action\\naccrues. In such case, the state insurance fund, if compensation be\\npayable therefrom, and otherwise the person, association, corporation or\\ninsurance carrier liable for the payment of such compensation, as the\\ncase may be, shall have a lien on the proceeds of any recovery from such\\nother, whether by judgment, settlement or otherwise, after the deduction\\nof the reasonable and necessary expenditures, including attorney's fees,\\nincurred in effecting such recovery, to the extent of the total amount\\nof compensation awarded under or provided or estimated by this chapter\\nfor such case and the expenses for medical treatment paid or to be paid\\nby it and to such extent such recovery shall be deemed for the benefit\\nof such fund, person, association, corporation or carrier. Should the\\nemployee or his dependents secure a recovery from such other, whether by\\njudgment, settlement or otherwise, such employee or dependents may apply\\non notice to such lienor to the court in which the third party action\\nwas instituted, or to a court of competent jurisdiction if no action was\\ninstituted, for an order apportioning the reasonable and necessary\\nexpenditures, including attorneys' fees, incurred in effecting such\\nrecovery. Such expenditures shall be equitably apportioned by the court\\nbetween the employee or his dependents and the lienor. Notice of the\\ncommencement of such action shall be given within thirty days thereafter\\nto the chairman, the employer and the insurance carrier upon a form\\nprescribed by the chairman. Any of the foregoing providers of\\ncompensation and/or medical benefits which has recovered a lien pursuant\\nto the provisions hereof against the recovery of a person injured on or\\nafter February first, nineteen hundred seventy-four and before July\\nfirst, nineteen hundred seventy-eight, through the use or operation of a\\nmotor vehicle in this state, shall notify such person by certified mail\\nin a manner to be approved by the chairman and the superintendent of\\nfinancial services of the responsibility of an \"insurer\" (as defined in\\nsubsection (g) of section five thousand one hundred two of the insurance\\nlaw), to reimburse such person under such circumstances to the extent\\nthat the recovered lien represent first party benefits as defined in\\narticle fifty-one of the insurance law.\\n  1-a. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the state\\ninsurance fund, if compensation and/or medical benefits be payable\\ntherefrom, or otherwise the person, association, corporation, insurance\\ncarrier or statutory fund liable for the payment of such compensation\\nand/or medical benefits shall not have a lien on the proceeds of any\\nrecovery received pursuant to subsection (a) of section five thousand\\none hundred four of the insurance law, whether by judgment, settlement\\nor otherwise for compensation and/or medical benefits paid which were in\\nlieu of first party benefits which another insurer would have otherwise\\nbeen obligated to pay under article fifty-one of the insurance law. The\\nsole remedy of any of the foregoing providers to recover the payments\\nspecified in the preceding sentence shall be pursuant to the settlement\\nprocedures contained in section five thousand one hundred five of the\\ninsurance law.\\n  1-b. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter to the\\ncontrary, the state insurance fund, if compensation and/or medical\\nbenefits be payable therefrom, or otherwise the person, association,\\ncorporation, insurance carrier or statutory fund liable for the payment\\nof such compensation and/or medical benefits: (a) shall not have a lien\\non the proceeds of any award from the September eleventh victim\\ncompensation fund of two thousand one established pursuant to title IV\\nof the federal air transportation safety and system stabilization act,\\npublic law 107-42, as amended; and (b) shall not terminate or reduce\\nsuch compensation and/or medical benefits based upon the submission of a\\nclaim for an award from such federal fund, and/or the waiver or\\ncompromise of any cause of action resulting from such submission.\\n  2. If such injured employee, or in case of death, his dependents, has\\ntaken compensation under this chapter but has failed to commence action\\nagainst such other within the time limited therefor by subdivision one,\\nsuch failure shall operate as an assignment of the cause of action\\nagainst such other to the state for the benefit of the state insurance\\nfund, if compensation be payable therefrom, and otherwise to the person,\\nassociation, corporation, or insurance carrier liable for the payment of\\nsuch compensation. Except as hereinafter provided, the failure of the\\ninjured employee or his dependents to commence an action pursuant to the\\nprovisions of subdivision one of this section, shall not operate as an\\nassignment of the cause of action as provided herein, unless the\\ninsurance carrier shall have notified the claimant in writing by\\npersonal service or by certified or registered mail, return receipt\\nrequested, at least thirty days prior to the expiration of the time\\nlimited for the commencement of an action by subdivision one, that such\\nfailure to commence such action shall operate as an assignment of\\nwhatever cause of action may exist to such insurance carrier. If the\\ninsurance carrier shall fail to give such notice, the time limited for\\nthe commencement of an action by subdivision one shall be extended until\\nthirty days after the insurance carrier shall have notified the claimant\\nin writing that failure to commence an action within thirty days after\\nthe mailing of such notice shall operate as an assignment of the cause\\nof action to such carrier, and in the event the claimant fails to\\ncommence such action within thirty days after the mailing of such\\nnotice, such failure shall operate as an assignment of such cause of\\naction to such carrier. If such fund, person, association, corporation\\nor carrier, as such an assignee, recover from such other, either by\\njudgment, settlement or otherwise, a sum in excess of the total amount\\nof compensation awarded to such injured employee or his dependents and\\nthe expenses for medical treatment paid by it, together with the\\nreasonable and necessary expenditures incurred in effecting such\\nrecovery, it shall forthwith pay to such injured employee or his\\ndependents, as the case may be, two-thirds of such excess, and to the\\nextent of two-thirds of any such excess such recovery shall be deemed\\nfor the benefit of such employee or his dependents. When the\\ncompensation awarded requires periodical payments the number of which\\ncannot be determined at the time of such award, the board shall, when\\nthe injury or death was caused by the negligence or wrong of another not\\nin the same employ, estimate the probable total amount thereof upon the\\nbasis of the survivorship annuitants table of mortality, the remarriage\\ntables of the Dutch Royal Insurance Institution and such facts as it may\\ndeem pertinent, and such estimate shall be deemed the amount of the\\ncompensation awarded in such case, for the purpose of computing the\\namount of such excess recovery, subject to the modification thereof as\\nhereinafter provided. If any of the foregoing providers, having paid\\nbenefits under this chapter to an injured employee, who is also a\\n\"covered person\" (as defined in subsection (j) of section five thousand\\none hundred two of the insurance law), and who was injured in a motor\\nvehicle accident in this state on and after February first, nineteen\\nhundred seventy-four and before July first, nineteen hundred\\nseventy-eight, maintains an action, as assignee, against such third\\nparty, who is also a \"covered person\", and recovers, whether by\\njudgment, settlement or otherwise, it shall advise the injured employee,\\nby certified mail, in a manner to be approved by the chairman and the\\nsuperintendent of financial services, of the responsibility of an\\n\"insurer\" (as defined in subsection (g) of section five thousand one\\nhundred two of the insurance law) to further compensate such injured\\nemployee.\\n  2-a. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, the failure\\nof a \"covered person\" (as defined in subsection (j) of section five\\nthousand one hundred two of the insurance law), who has taken\\ncompensation and/or medical benefits under this chapter for injuries\\narising out of the use or operation of a motor vehicle in this state, to\\ncommence an action against such other within the time limited therefor\\nby subdivision one of this section shall not operate as an assignment of\\nthe cause of action to the provider thereof for their recovery when such\\nbenefits were paid in lieu of first party benefits which another insurer\\nwould have otherwise been obligated to pay under article fifty-one of\\nthe insurance law, unless such other is not a \"covered person\". The sole\\nremedy of any of the foregoing providers to recover the payments\\nspecified in the preceding sentence when the other party is a \"covered\\nperson\" shall be pursuant to the settlement procedures contained in\\nsection five thousand one hundred five of the insurance law.\\n  3. In the event of a modification of an award increasing the\\ncompensation previously awarded or in the event that the total amount of\\nperiodical payments made pursuant to an award under which the number of\\nsuch payments could not be determined at the time of the award, shall\\nexceed the total thereof as estimated by the board, the principal of any\\nof such excess recovery theretofore paid to such injured employee or his\\ndependents shall be credited against such increase or such excess. In\\nthe event of a modification of an award ending or diminishing the\\ncompensation previously awarded or in the event that the total amount of\\nperiodical payments made pursuant to an award under which the number of\\nsuch payments could not be determined at the time of the award, shall be\\nless than the total thereof as estimated by the board, such fund,\\nperson, association, corporation or carrier shall forthwith pay to such\\ninjured employee or his dependents, as the case may be, any additional\\namount of such excess recovery to which such injured employee or his\\ndependents may be entitled by reason of such modification or such\\ndeficiency, determined as hereinbefore provided.\\n  4. If such injured employee, or in case of death, his dependents,\\nproceed against such other, the state insurance fund, person,\\nassociation, corporation, or insurance carrier, as the case may be,\\nshall contribute only the deficiency, if any, between the amount of the\\nrecovery against such other person actually collected, and the\\ncompensation provided or estimated by this chapter for such case.\\n  5. In case of the payment of an award to the commissioner of taxation\\nand finance in accordance with subdivisions eight and nine of section\\nfifteen and in accordance with section twenty-five-a such payment shall\\noperate to give to the employer or insurance carrier liable for the\\naward a cause of action for the amount of such payment together with the\\nreasonable funeral expenses and the expense of medical treatment which\\nshall be in addition to any cause of action by the legal representatives\\nof the deceased. Such a cause of action assigned to the state may be\\nprosecuted or compromised in the name of the state insurance fund by the\\ncommissioners of the state insurance fund. A compromise of any such\\ncause of action by the employee or his dependents at an amount less than\\nthe compensation provided for by this chapter shall be made only with\\nthe written approval of the commissioners of the state insurance fund or\\nsuch officer thereof designated by them, if the deficiency of\\ncompensation would be payable from the state insurance fund, and\\notherwise with the written approval of the person, association,\\ncorporation, or insurance carrier liable to pay the same. However,\\nwritten approval of the commissioners of the state insurance fund or\\nsuch officer thereof designated by them or written approval of the\\nperson, association, corporation, or the insurance carrier need not be\\nobtained if the employee or his dependents obtain a compromise order\\nfrom a justice of the court in which the third-party action was pending.\\nThe papers upon an application to compromise and settle such a claim\\nshall consist of the petition, the affidavit of the attorney, and the\\naffidavit of one or more physicians.\\n  The petition shall contain the following:\\n  a. The name and residence of the petitioner if the employee, or\\npetitioner's relationship to the deceased;\\n  b. The date of accident and a general description thereof;\\n  c. The nature and extent of the damages sustained, including the name\\nof the physician or physicians attending or consulting in the treatment\\nand the medical expenses incurred, the period of disability resulting\\nfrom the accident, the total amount of wages lost thereby, and the\\npresent physical condition;\\n  d. The terms of the attorney's retainer and of the proposed settlement\\nand petitioner's approval thereof; and\\n  e. Whether any previous application for the settlement of the claim\\nhas been made, and if so, the time and the court or justice thereof and\\nthe disposition made of same.\\n  The affidavit of the attorney shall set forth by whom, on what date\\nand under what terms he was retained, the services rendered by him, his\\nfee if the settlement is approved, the acts complained of, the terms of\\nthe proposed settlement with a statement of his reasons for recommending\\nthe same, and shall state that he has not become concerned in the\\napplication or its subject matter at the instance of such defendant\\ndirectly or indirectly and that he has not received and is not to\\nreceive any compensation from such defendant directly or indirectly.\\n  The affidavit of the physician in a claim arising from personal injury\\nto the employee, shall set forth his connection with the case; the\\nperiod covered by the treatment and the nature, duration and extent of\\nthe injuries; the date of his last examination and the condition of the\\nemployee at that time; whether or not the employee is still suffering\\nany disability or inconvenience as the result of the injury, giving the\\ndetails thereof; whether or not the accident has left the employee with\\nany permanent disability, defect, scar or impairment; the cost of the\\ntreatment and whether or not he expects to be paid or has been paid by\\nthe defendant or by anyone acting on the defendant's behalf. Where the\\naffidavit as to the present condition is not made by the attending\\nphysician, the latter's affidavit setting forth the character of the\\ninjuries and treatment should also be attached, or the failure to obtain\\nit explained. Where the employee was confined to a hospital, the court\\nmay require the production of hospital records.\\n  A copy of the papers to be used on the application to compromise and\\nsettle the claim must be served as directed by the court or in the same\\nmanner as provided in the civil practice law and rules for a notice of\\nmotion upon the commissioners of the state insurance fund or such\\nofficer thereof designated by them or upon the person, association,\\ncorporation, or insurance carrier, whose written approval would have\\nbeen required to compromise such cause of action by the employee or his\\ndependents. This notice shall afford them the opportunity to submit\\naffidavits and to be heard by the court on the application.\\n  If the third-party action is on trial at the time the offer of\\nsettlement which is acceptable to the plaintiff, is made and either such\\nwritten approval or order as provided in this subdivision is required,\\nthe action may be marked settled subject to the securing of such written\\napproval or such order. If such written approval or such order is not\\nsubsequently secured within three months the action shall be restored to\\nthe head of the trial day calendar.\\n  6. The right to compensation or benefits under this chapter, shall be\\nthe exclusive remedy to an employee, or in case of death his or her\\ndependents, when such employee is injured or killed by the negligence or\\nwrong of another in the same employ, the employer's insurer or any\\ncollective bargaining agent of the employer's employees or any employee,\\nof such insurer or such collective bargaining agent (while acting within\\nthe scope of his or her employment). The limitation of liability of an\\nemployer set forth in section eleven of this article for the injury or\\ndeath of an employee shall be applicable to another in the same employ,\\nthe employer's insurer, any collective bargaining agent of the\\nemployer's employees or any employee of the employer's insurer or such\\ncollective bargaining agent (while acting within the scope of his or her\\nemployment). The option to maintain an action in the courts for damages\\nbased on the employer's failure to secure compensation for injured\\nemployees and their dependents as set forth in section eleven of this\\narticle shall not be construed to include the right to maintain an\\naction against another in the same employ, the employer's insurer, any\\ncollective bargaining agent of the employer's employees or any employee\\nof the employer's insurer or such collective bargaining agent (while\\nacting within the scope of his or her employment).\\n",

              "text" : "  § 32. Waiver agreements. No agreement or release except as otherwise\\nprovided in this chapter by an employee to waive his right to\\ncompensation under this chapter shall be valid.\\n  (a) Whenever a claim has been filed, the claimant or the deceased\\nclaimant's dependents and the employer, its carrier, the special\\ndisability fund as set forth in subdivision (e) of this section, or the\\naggregate trust fund, if the board has directed that the present value\\nof any unpaid compensation be paid into such fund pursuant to section\\ntwenty-seven of this article, may enter into an agreement settling upon\\nand determining the compensation and other benefits due to the claimant\\nor his or her dependents. The agreement shall not bind the parties to\\nit, unless it is approved by the board. Such agreements, when so\\napproved, notwithstanding any other provisions, shall be final and\\nconclusive upon the claimant, the claimant's dependents, the employer,\\nits insurance carrier, the aggregate trust fund and the special\\ndisability fund. Every insurance carrier as defined in subdivision\\ntwelve of section two of this chapter shall offer each claimant the\\nopportunity to enter into an agreement settling upon and determining the\\ncompensation and other benefits due, in the case of disability, within\\ntwo years after the date the claim was indexed by the board or six\\nmonths after the claimant is classified with a permanent disability,\\nwhichever is later, and in the case of death, within six months after\\nentitlement to benefits is established for all beneficiaries. The offer\\nmade by the insurance carrier shall clearly state what portion of the\\noffer is (i) for compensation as defined in subdivision six of section\\ntwo of this chapter, if any; (ii) for medical benefits, including\\nprescription medicine, if any; and (iii) for the fee of the attorney or\\nlicensed representative, if any. If a claimant is represented by an\\nattorney or licensed representative, the insurance carrier shall present\\nsuch offer to such legal representative. If a claimant is not\\nrepresented by an attorney or a licensed representative, the insurance\\ncarrier shall, in addition to the offer to enter into a settlement\\nagreement, provide the claimant with a statement of his or her rights,\\nobligations and potential liability if the offer is accepted.\\n  (b) The agreement shall be approved by the board in a decision duly\\nfiled and served unless:\\n  (1) the board finds the proposed agreement unfair, unconscionable, or\\nimproper as a matter of law;\\n  (2) the board finds that the proposed agreement is the result of an\\nintentional misrepresentation of material fact; or,\\n  (3) within ten days of submitting the agreement one of the interested\\nparties requests that the board disapprove the agreement.\\n  (c) A decision duly filed and served approving an agreement submitted\\nto the board shall not be subject to review pursuant to section\\ntwenty-three of this article. However, a decision duly filed and served\\ndisapproving an agreement submitted to the board is subject to review\\npursuant to section twenty-three of this article. If the board\\ndisapproves of an agreement it shall duly file and serve a notice of\\ndecision setting aside the proposed agreement.\\n  (d) An agreement for compensation and other benefits covered by this\\nchapter may be modified at anytime by agreement of all interested\\nparties provided it is approved by the board.\\n  (e) The chair shall establish an office under his or her supervision\\nto be known as the \"waiver agreement management office,\" to negotiate\\nand seek board approval for waiver agreements on behalf of the special\\ndisability fund. The office shall operate in accordance with guidelines\\nor directives that the chair may issue, as approved by the special\\ndisability fund advisory committee, or in the absence of such guidelines\\nor directives, using such discounting factors as the office determines\\nare in the financial interest of the special disability fund. The waiver\\nagreement management office on behalf of the special disability fund may\\nenter into a waiver agreement with a claimant only when the special\\ndisability fund has been found liable by the board to reimburse the\\nclaimant's employer, insurance carrier or the state insurance fund.\\nNotwithstanding any other provisions of law, no consultation or approval\\nof any employer, insurance carrier, self-insurer or the state insurance\\nfund shall be required before such office may enter into any waiver\\nagreement, or before the board may approve such waiver agreement. The\\nchair may, in his or her discretion, and as approved by the special\\ndisability fund advisory committee, terminate the operation of the\\nwaiver agreement management office, if he or she believes it no longer\\nserves the interest of the special disability fund.\\n  (f) A claimant's executed waiver agreement with the waiver agreement\\nmanagement office shall be final and conclusive upon the claimant, the\\nclaimant's dependents, and any employer, self-insurer, insurance\\ncarrier, the state insurance fund and the special disability fund as to\\nall claims by the claimant, and as to any claim or request for\\nreimbursement from the special disability fund for payments not yet\\nmade. The waiver agreement management office shall give written notice\\nto any employer, insurance carrier or the state insurance fund entitled\\nto receive reimbursement from the special disability fund in regard to\\nany claimant, of any waiver agreement signed by the office with such\\nclaimant within fourteen days of submitting the waiver agreement to the\\nboard for approval.\\n  (g) Nothing in this section shall prohibit any insurance carrier,\\nemployer, the state insurance fund, or the waiver agreement management\\noffice on behalf of the special disability fund from jointly entering\\ninto a waiver agreement with a claimant, by which the joint signatories\\nmay apportion responsibility for making any payments required under the\\nagreement. The agreement shall set forth the obligations of the\\nsignatories to make such payments, and shall identify, as to each\\nobligation thereunder: (1) the signatory that has the legal obligation\\nto carry out that provision, or (2) that all signatories are jointly and\\nseverally liable under the provision.\\n  (h) Neither the establishment of the waiver agreement management\\noffice, nor any action taken by that office, shall serve as grounds for\\nthe board's disapproval of any waiver agreement to which the office is\\nnot a party, or otherwise permit any party to withdraw from such a\\nwaiver agreement.\\n  (i) (1) The waiver agreement management office may contract with an\\ninsurance carrier, self-insured employer, state insurance fund or any\\nthird party to assume liability for, manage, administer, or settle\\nclaims on its behalf, so long as (A) such contract is approved by the\\nspecial disability fund advisory committee and (B) such party shall\\nagree to be subject to any guidelines or directives as the chair may\\nissue.\\n  (2) The chair may, with approval of the special disability fund\\nadvisory committee and on such terms as the committee deems appropriate,\\nprocure one or more private entities to assume the liability for and\\nmanage, administer, or settle all or a portion of the claims in the\\nspecial disability fund including, without limitation, by obtaining \"an\\nassumption of workers' compensation liability insurance policy\" as\\ndefined in subdivision three of section fifty of this chapter. Any such\\npolicy shall expressly provide and, notwithstanding any other provision\\nof law, operate to release from any further liability (i) the special\\ndisability fund and (ii) the insurance carrier, including as the case\\nmay be the state insurance fund, originally liable for any claim covered\\nby the assumption of workers' compensation liability insurance policy\\nsecuring such further and future contingent liability as may arise from\\nany such claim, including from prior injuries to employees and be\\nincurred by reason of any change in the condition of such employees for\\npayment of additional compensation. Notwithstanding any other provisions\\nof law, no consultation or approval of any employer, insurance carrier,\\nself-insurer or the state insurance fund shall be required before such\\noffice may enter into any such policy of waiver agreement, or before the\\nboard may approve such waiver agreement. Any such procurement shall be\\nconducted in accordance with state finance law, except as otherwise set\\nforth below. The chair shall not award any contract that has not been\\napproved by the special disability fund advisory committee.\\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, the chair of the workers' compensation\\nboard may, if approved by the special disability fund advisory\\ncommittee, and on such terms as the committee deems appropriate:\\n  (A) waive any informality in a bid, and either reject all bids and\\nagain advertise for bids, or interview at least two responsible\\nqualified bidders and negotiate and enter into a contract with one or\\nmore of such bidders; or\\n  (B) group claims to be assigned, in whole or in part, based on the\\ninsurance carrier, self-insured employer or state insurance fund that is\\nreceiving or will receive reimbursement on those claims from the second\\ndisability fund. Such grouping shall be permissible notwithstanding that\\nany insurance carrier may have greater access to information, or may be\\nable to provide better terms, in regard to claims so grouped.\\n  (3) Any policy executed by the chair pursuant to this section shall be\\nin the form of an assumption of workers' compensation liability\\ninsurance policy securing such further and future contingent liability\\nas may arise from any claim covered by such policy, including prior\\ninjuries to workers and be incurred by reason of any change in the\\ncondition of such workers warranting the board making subsequent awards\\nfor payment of additional compensation. Such policy shall be in a form\\napproved by the superintendent of financial services and issued by the\\nstate insurance fund or any insurance company licensed to issue this\\nclass of insurance in this state, or deemed acceptable as an issuer upon\\napplication by the chair to the superintendent as specified in\\nsubdivision three of section fifty of this chapter. In the event that\\nsuch policy is issued by an insurance company other than the state\\ninsurance fund, then said policy shall be deemed of the kind specified\\nin paragraph fifteen of subsection (a) of section one thousand one\\nhundred thirteen of the insurance law and covered by the workers'\\ncompensation security fund as created and governed by article six-a of\\nthis chapter. Such policy shall only be issued for a single complete\\npremium paid in advance and in an amount deemed acceptable by the chair\\nand the superintendent of financial services. When issued such policy\\nshall be noncancellable without recourse for any cause during the\\ncontinuance of the liability secured and so covered.\\n  (4) Notwithstanding any other provision of this article, the waiver\\nagreement management office may request in writing any information\\nrelevant to its entry into or management of waiver agreements from (A)\\nany insurance carrier, employer, or the state insurance fund, if that\\nentity has submitted a claim for reimbursement from the special\\ndisability fund as to the claimant to whom the information relates; or\\n(B) the special funds conservation committee. The party to whom the\\nrequest is made shall provide the requested information within fourteen\\ndays of the request, unless before that date it files an objection with\\nthe board to any information which is subject to a recognized privilege\\nor whose production is otherwise barred by law. The objecting party\\nshall provide the requested information within five business days of the\\nboard's rejection of its objection.\\n  (5) No carrier, self-insured employer or the state insurance fund\\nshall assume the liability for, or management, administration or\\nsettlement of any claims under this section on which it holds reserves,\\nbeyond such reserves as are permitted by regulation of the\\nsuperintendent of financial services for purposes of this provision. No\\ncarrier may assume liability for any claims in the special disability\\nfund under this paragraph unless the carrier maintains, on a stand alone\\nbasis, separate from its parent or any affiliated entities, an\\ninteractive financial strength rating from a nationally recognized\\nstatistical rating organization that is considered secure or deemed\\nacceptable by the special disability fund advisory committee.\\n  (6) The director of the budget shall notify in writing the chairs of\\nthe senate finance committee and the assembly ways and means committee\\nof any plans to transfer all or a portion of the portfolio of claims\\ndetermined to be eligible for reimbursement from the special disability\\nfund or to enter into an assumption of workers' compensation liability\\ninsurance policy, not less than forty-five days prior to the\\ncommencement of such process. At any time borrowing is anticipated to\\nsettle claims, the chief executive officer of the dormitory authority of\\nthe state of New York and the director of the budget shall provide a\\nreport to the chairs of the senate finance committee and the assembly\\nways and means committee on a planned bond sale of the authority and\\nsuch report shall include, but not be limited to: (A) the maximum amount\\nof bonds expected to be sold by the authority in connection with a sale\\nagreement; (B) the expected maximum interest rate and maturity date of\\nsuch bonds; (C) the expected amount of the bonds that will be fixed\\nand/or variable interest rate; (D) the estimated costs of issuance; (E)\\nthe estimated level or levels of reserve fund or funds, if any; (F) the\\nestimated cost of bond issuance, if any; (G) the anticipated use or uses\\nof the proceeds; (H) the maximum expected net proceeds that will be paid\\nto the state as a result of the issuance of such bonds; and (I) the\\nprocess to be used to select parties to the transaction. Any such\\nexpectations and estimates in the report shall not be deemed a\\nsubstantive limitation on the authority of the dormitory authority of\\nthe state of New York.\\n",

By insuring and keeping insured the payment of such compensation\\nwith any stock corporation, mutual corporation or reciprocal insurer\\nauthorized to transact the business of workers' compensation insurance\\nin this state through a policy issued under the law of this state.\\n  3. By furnishing satisfactory proof to the chair of his financial\\nability to pay such compensation for himself, or to pay such\\ncompensation on behalf of a group of employers in accordance with\\nsubdivision ten of this section, in which case the chair shall require\\nthe deposit with the chair of such securities as the chair may deem\\nnecessary of the kind prescribed in subdivisions one, two, three, four\\nand five, and subparagraph (a) of paragraph three of subdivision seven\\nof section two hundred thirty-five of the banking law, or the deposit of\\ncash, or the filing of irrevocable letters of credit issued by a\\nqualified banking institution as defined by rules promulgated by the\\nchair or the filing of a bond of a surety company authorized to transact\\nbusiness in this state, in an amount to be determined by the chair, or\\nthe posting and filing as aforesaid of a combination of such securities,\\ncash, irrevocable letters of credit and surety bond in an amount to be\\ndetermined by the chair, to secure his liability to pay the compensation\\nprovided in this chapter. Any such surety bond must be approved as to\\nform by the chair. If an employer or group of employers posts and files\\na combination of securities, cash, irrevocable letters of credit and\\nsurety bond as aforesaid, and if it becomes necessary to use the same to\\npay the compensation provided in this chapter, the chair shall first use\\nsuch securities or cash or irrevocable letters of credit and, when the\\nfull amount thereof has been exhausted, he shall then require the surety\\nto pay forthwith to the chair all or any part of the penal sum of the\\nbond for that purpose. The chair may also require an agreement on the\\npart of the employer or group of employers to pay any awards commuted\\nunder section twenty-seven of this chapter, into the special fund of the\\nstate fund, as a condition of his being allowed to remain uninsured\\npursuant to this section. The chair shall have the authority to deny the\\napplication of an employer or group of employers to pay such\\ncompensation for himself or to revoke his consent furnished, under this\\nsection at any time, for good cause shown. The employer or group of\\nemployers qualifying under this subdivision shall be known as a\\nself-insurer.\\n  If for any reason the status of an employer or group of employers\\nunder this subdivision is terminated, the securities or the surety bond,\\nor the securities, cash, or irrevocable letters of credit and surety\\nbond, on deposit referred to herein shall remain in the custody of the\\nchair for such time as the chair may deem proper and warranted under the\\ncircumstances. In lieu thereof, and at the discretion of the chair, the\\nemployer, his or her heirs or assigns or others carrying on or\\nliquidating such business, may execute an assumption of workers'\\ncompensation liability insurance policy as described herein. Separately,\\nthe chair may execute an assumption of workers' compensation liability\\ninsurance policy as described herein on behalf of the special funds\\ncreated under the provisions of subdivisions eight and nine of section\\nfifteen and section twenty-five-a of this chapter, and notwithstanding\\nany provision to the contrary the chair may execute an assumption of\\nworkers' compensation liability insurance policy on behalf of the\\nuninsured employers' fund. An assumption of workers' compensation\\nliability policy referred to herein shall secure such further and future\\ncontingent liability as may directly or indirectly arise from prior\\ninjuries to workers and be incurred by reason of any change in condition\\nof such workers warranting the board making subsequent awards for\\npayment of additional compensation. Such policy shall be in a form\\napproved by the superintendent of financial services and issued by the\\nstate fund or any insurance company licensed to issue this class of\\ninsurance in this state or, upon application by the chair, any other\\ninsurance company deemed by the superintendent of financial services to\\nbe an acceptable issuer. In the event that such policy is issued by an\\ninsurance company other than the state fund, then said policy shall be\\ndeemed of the kind specified in paragraph fifteen of subsection (a) of\\nsection one thousand one hundred thirteen of the insurance law and\\ncovered by the workers' compensation security fund as created and\\ngoverned by article six-A of this chapter. It shall only be issued for a\\nsingle complete premium payment in advance and in an amount deemed\\nacceptable by the chair and the superintendent of financial services. In\\nlieu of the applicable premium charge ordinarily required to be imposed\\nby a carrier, said premium shall include a surcharge in an amount to be\\ndetermined by the chair to: (i) satisfy all assessment liability due and\\nowing to the board and/or the chair under this chapter; and (ii) satisfy\\nall future assessment liability under this section, and which surcharge\\nshall be adjusted from time to time to reflect any changes to the\\nassessment of group self-insured employers, including any changes\\nenacted by the chapter of the laws of two thousand eleven amending\\nsections fifteen and one hundred fifty-one of this chapter. Said\\nsurcharge shall be payable to the board simultaneous to the execution of\\nthe assumption of workers' compensation liability insurance policy.\\nHowever, the payment of said surcharge does not relieve the carrier from\\nany other liability, including liability owed to the superintendent of\\nfinancial services pursuant to article six-A of this chapter. When\\nissued such policy shall be non-cancellable without recourse for any\\ncause during the continuance of the liability secured and so covered.\\n  3-a. Group self-insurance. (1) Definitions. As used in this chapter\\nthe term \"employers\" shall include: (a) employers with related activity\\nin a given industry which shall include municipal corporations as that\\nterm is defined in sections two and six-n of the general municipal law,\\nemploying persons who perform work in connection with the given\\nindustry, (b) an incorporated or unincorporated association or\\nassociations consisting exclusively of such employers provided they\\nemploy persons who perform such related work in the given industry, and\\n(c) a combination of employers as described in subparagraph (a) hereof\\nand an association or associations of employers as described in\\nsubparagraph (b) hereof.\\n  (2) (a) Any group consisting exclusively of such employers may adopt a\\nplan for self-insurance, as a group, for the payment of compensation\\nunder this chapter to their employees, except that no new groups may\\nadopt such a plan, and no group not composed solely of public entities\\nset forth in paragraph a of subdivision four of this section may insure\\nany liabilities for any employers on and after January first, two\\nthousand twelve, except as provided for in paragraph ten of this\\nsubdivision. Under such plan the group shall assume the liability of all\\nthe employers within the group and pay all compensation for which the\\nsaid employers are liable under this chapter, except that in the case of\\nmunicipal corporations as herein defined no proof of financial ability\\nor deposit of securities or cash need be made in compliance with this\\nsubdivision. The group qualifying under this subdivision shall be known\\nas a group self-insurer and the employers participating therein and\\ncovered thereby shall be known as members.\\n  (b) Where such plan is adopted the group self-insurer shall furnish\\nsatisfactory proof to the chair of its financial ability to pay such\\ncompensation for the members in the industry covered by it, its\\nrevenues, their source and assurance of continuance. The chair shall\\nrequire the deposit with the chair of such securities as may be deemed\\nnecessary of the kind prescribed in subdivisions one, two, three, four\\nand five, and subparagraph (a) of paragraph three of subdivision seven\\nof section two hundred thirty-five of the banking law or the deposit of\\ncash or the filing of irrevocable letters of credit issued by a\\nqualified banking institution as defined by rules promulgated by the\\nchair or the filing of a bond of a surety company authorized to transact\\nbusiness in this state, in an amount to be determined to secure its\\nliability to pay the compensation of each employer as above provided.\\nSuch surety bond must be approved as to form by the chair. The chair\\nshall require each group self-insurer to provide regular reports no less\\nthan annually, which shall include but not be limited to audited\\nfinancial statements, actuarial opinions and payroll information\\ncontaining proof that it is fully funded. Such reports shall also\\ninclude a contribution year analysis detailing contributions and\\nexpenses associated with each specific contribution year. For purposes\\nof this paragraph, proof that a group self-insurer is fully funded shall\\nat a minimum include proof of unrestricted cash and investments\\npermitted by regulation of the chair of at least one hundred percent of\\nthe total liabilities, including the estimate presented in the actuarial\\nopinion submitted by the group self-insurer in accordance with this\\nchapter. The chair by regulation, may set further financial standards\\nfor group self-insurers. Any group self-insurer that fails to show that\\nit is fully funded shall be deemed underfunded, and must submit a plan\\nfor achieving fully funded status which may include a deficit assessment\\non members of such group self-insurer which shall be subject to approval\\nor modification by the chair. The amount of such under-funding, as\\nmeasured by the actuarial opinion or assumption of loss policy quotation\\nsubmitted by the group, shall be considered unfunded claims as set forth\\nin subdivision two of section sixteen hundred eighty-q of the public\\nauthorities law as added by section 35 of Part GG of chapter 57 of the\\nlaws of 2013.\\n  (c) The chair shall evaluate, no less than once every three years, a\\ngroup self-insurer's compliance with the financial and regulatory\\nrequirements for self-insurance. The chair may engage any qualified\\nperson or organization to assist with such evaluation and any costs\\nincurred by the chair shall be borne by the group self-insurer under\\nexamination. Failure to submit to such independent review or to pay such\\ncosts, upon demand of the chair, shall be sufficient grounds to\\nterminate coverage of the group self-insurer.\\n  (d) The chair may require reports to be prepared by an auditor,\\nactuary or other consultant, selected by the board or, at the chair's\\ndiscretion, by the group self-insurer from a list which shall be\\npre-approved by the chair to determine whether the group self-insurer\\nmeets the financial criteria for self-insurance. All actuaries so\\nselected shall be fellows or associates of the casualty actuarial\\nsociety.\\n  (e) The chair may also require that any and all agreements, contracts\\nand other pertinent documents relating to the organization of the\\nmembers in the group self-insurer shall be filed with the chair.\\n  (f) The chair shall have the authority to revoke consent furnished\\nunder this section at any time for good cause shown.\\n  (g) Prior to the requested effective date of the participating\\nagreement, a group self-insurer shall notify the chair on a prescribed\\nform of a new group self-insurer member and file (1) a member\\napplication and (2) a copy of the properly executed prescribed\\nparticipation agreement wherein the member acknowledges their joint and\\nseveral obligation for their period of membership. The board shall, on a\\nform promulgated by the chair, provide notice of the member's rights and\\nresponsibilities as a group self-insurer member, including the member's\\nassumption of joint and several liability, and require the member to\\nreturn a signed copy to the chair as a condition of membership.\\n  (h) Any member terminating membership in a group self-insurer after\\nless than four years in such group self-insurer, and any member in a\\ngroup self-insurer that has defaulted, shall be precluded from obtaining\\nprospective coverage from any group self-insurer for a period of at\\nleast three years from the effective date of termination.\\n  * (3) A member's participation in a group self-insurer shall not\\nrelieve it of its liability for compensation prescribed by this chapter\\nexcept by the payment thereof by the group self-insurer or by itself.\\nEach member shall be responsible, jointly and severally, for all\\nliabilities of the group self-insurer provided for by this chapter\\noccurring during its respective period of membership, and such liability\\nshall attach to any recipient of a conveyance of assets made in\\nviolation of section two hundred seventy-three of the debtor and\\ncreditor law. As between the employee and the group self-insurer, notice\\nto or knowledge of the occurrence of the injury on the part of the\\nmember shall be deemed notice or knowledge, as the case may be, on the\\npart of the group self-insurer; jurisdiction of the member shall, for\\nthe purpose of this chapter, be jurisdiction of the group self-insurer\\nand such group self-insurer shall in all things be bound by and subject\\nto the orders, findings, decisions or awards rendered against the\\nparticipating member for the payment of compensation under the\\nprovisions of this chapter.  The insolvency or bankruptcy of a\\nparticipating member shall not relieve the group self-insurer from the\\npayment of compensation for injuries or death sustained by an employee\\nduring the time the member was a participant in such group self-insurer.\\nNotice of termination of a participating member shall not be effective\\nuntil at least ten days after notice of such termination, on a\\nprescribed form, has been either filed in the office of the chair or\\nsent by certified or registered letter, return receipt requested, and\\nalso served in like manner upon the member. In the event such\\ntermination is due to a member's failure to pay required contributions,\\nsuch member's termination shall not be rescinded more than three times.\\n  * NB Effective until April 4, 2020\\n  * (3) A member's participation in a group self-insurer shall not\\nrelieve it of its liability for compensation prescribed by this chapter\\nexcept by the payment thereof by the group self-insurer or by itself.\\nEach member shall be responsible, jointly and severally, for all\\nliabilities of the group self-insurer provided for by this chapter\\noccurring during its respective period of membership, and such liability\\nshall attach to any recipient of a conveyance of assets made in\\nviolation of subdivision (a) of section two hundred seventy-four of the\\ndebtor and creditor law.

The insolvency or\\nbankruptcy of a participating member shall not relieve the group\\nself-insurer from the payment of compensation for injuries or death\\nsustained by an employee during the time the member was a participant in\\nsuch group self-insurer.  Notice of termination of a participating\\nmember shall not be effective until at least ten days after notice of\\nsuch termination, on a prescribed form, has been either filed in the\\noffice of the chair or sent by certified or registered letter, return\\nreceipt requested, and also served in like manner upon the member. In\\nthe event such termination is due to a member's failure to pay required\\ncontributions, such member's termination shall not be rescinded more\\nthan three times.\\n  * NB Effective April 4, 2020\\n  (4) Each group self-insurer, in its application for self-insurance,\\nshall set forth the names and addresses of each of its officers,\\ndirectors, trustees, third party administrator and group administrator.\\nNotice of any change in the officers, directors, trustees, third party\\nadministrator or group administrator shall be given to the chair within\\nten days thereof. No officer, director, trustee, employee, third party\\nadministrator or group administrator of the group self-insurer may\\nrepresent or participate directly or indirectly on behalf of an injured\\nworker or his dependents in any workers' compensation proceeding. All\\nemployees of members participating in group self-insurance shall be and\\nare deemed to be included under the group self-insurance plan.\\n  (5) (a) Each group self-insurer shall secure the services of a group\\nadministrator to be responsible for assisting the group self-insurer in\\ncomplying with the provisions of this section and the rules and\\nregulations promulgated hereunder, and for coordinating services\\nincluding but not limited to claims processing, loss control, legal,\\naccounting and actuarial services. No person, firm or corporation shall\\ncoordinate such services or otherwise carry out the tasks of a group\\nadministrator as provided in this subdivision or in the regulations\\nissued pursuant thereto on behalf of a group self-insurer unless such\\nperson shall have obtained from the chair a license authorizing it to\\nact as a group self-insurer administrator, which license may be revoked\\nfor good cause. The chair shall promulgate regulations setting forth any\\nadditional qualifications for such license, governing the conduct and\\ncompensation of group self-insurer administrators, and setting a license\\nfee in an amount not less than five thousand dollars per year for such\\nlicense for each group self-insurer the administrator administers. Each\\nadministrator shall post a bond in the amount of five hundred thousand\\ndollars for each group self-insurer administered or such other amount as\\nmay be set by the chair based on the cost and availability of such bond,\\nfrom which the chair may recover any recoveries or penalties against the\\nadministrator under this section.

The chair may impose a civil penalty of up to twenty thousand\\ndollars for each such violation. A second and subsequent violation of\\nthis paragraph shall be a class D felony. The chair may recover in a\\ncivil action any damages resulting from such misrepresentations,\\nincluding the value of any amount assessed against any entities that are\\nnot members of the defaulted self-insurer that resulted from any such\\nmisrepresentation.\\n  (d) (1) A group administrator shall provide an annual written report\\nto all members of the group self-insurer and to the board which shall\\ninclude:\\n  a. the members of the group self-insurer;\\n  b. the group administrator and trustees;\\n  c. the results of the most recent financial audit;\\n  d. the percentage of total liabilities held by the self-insurer in\\nunrestricted cash and investments permitted by regulation as determined\\nin accordance with subparagraph (b) of paragraph two of this\\nsubdivision;\\n  e. the number and amount of rate deviations provided to members during\\nthe prior year and whether the recipient of any such deviation was a\\ntrustee; and\\n  f. such other information as the chair may direct.\\n  The group administrator shall provide a copy of the most recent\\nfinancial audit to any group self-insurer member upon written request.\\n  (2) The chair shall make available to the public, on its website and\\nin writing upon request:\\n  a. the identity of all group self-insurers that have provided workers'\\ncompensation under this subdivision in the prior three years;\\n  b. the group administrator of each such group self-insurer;\\n  c. the financial condition of all group self-insurers as determined by\\nthe board in the last financial audit and the board's regulatory\\ndefinition of assets; and\\n  d. such other information as the chair may direct, but which shall not\\ninclude any confidential or proprietary information.\\n  The board may direct the disclosure of any non-proprietary information\\nregarding any group self-insurer, including whether a member is a member\\nthereof, to any claimant upon a showing of need.\\n  (e) (1) The chair may condition the issuance or continuation of a\\nlicense under this subdivision upon the presentation by a group\\nadministrator of such information as the board requests, at any time\\nchosen by the chair or at regular intervals, including but not limited\\nto the annual financial statements of the group administrator detailing\\nthe compensation the administrator and its substantially owned\\naffiliated entities, as defined in section two of this chapter, have\\nreceived or shall receive from the group self-insurer or its members,\\nand the method by which such compensation has been or will be\\ncalculated. The chair may issue regulations governing the method of\\ncalculating compensation which a group administrator may receive,\\nincluding restrictions on the process by which such compensation may be\\nset.\\n  (2) The chair may revoke the license of any group administrator that\\nreceives compensation in violation of such regulations, and may impose a\\npenalty of up to two times any compensation so received.\\n  (f) (1) No officer or director of, or person holding five percent or\\nmore ownership interest in, a group administrator shall within two years\\nof serving in such capacity or holding such ownership interest, serve in\\nany capacity or hold any ownership interest in a workers' compensation\\ncarrier that provides or solicits the provision of compensation under\\nthis title for any employer that is or was a member of such group\\nself-insurer. No officer or director of, or person holding five percent\\nor more ownership interest in a group administrator shall serve in such\\ncapacity or hold such ownership interest in a carrier that provides or\\nsolicits excess coverage for any group self-insurer administered by such\\nadministrator.\\n  (2) The chair may impose a civil penalty of up to ten thousand dollars\\nfor each violation of this paragraph.\\n  (g) Each group self-insurer shall submit to the chair copies of any\\nagreement or contract with an entity that serves or will serve as its\\ngroup administrator, accountant, actuary or third party administrator at\\nleast thirty days prior to becoming effective, and the effectiveness of\\nsuch contract shall be conditioned on the absence of an objection by the\\nboard during the thirty day period. Contracts that shall be subject to\\nsuch objection shall include any contract in violation of regulation;\\nand any contract that does not provide reasonable cancellation or\\nrenewal terms, including any contract that requires an affirmative act\\nby the trustees of the group self-insurer to prevent automatic renewal,\\nor that does not permit cancellation for negligence, violation of law,\\nor other good cause.\\n  (6) (a) Group self-insurers must file with the board, as soon as\\npracticable but no later than sixty days prior to the start of the fund\\nyear a rating plan which is supported by an actuarial rate study\\nprepared by an independent, qualified actuary that is a fellow or\\nassociate of the casualty actuarial society, that clearly identifies the\\nactuary's indicated rate assumptions therein. The rating plan must apply\\nconsistently to all members, and must provide for a common renewal date\\nfor all group self-insurer members. The rates filed can be adjusted\\nbased on an experience modification calculated for every member in\\naccordance with the experience rating plan promulgated by the workers'\\ncompensation rating board. Experience modification formulas must be\\napplied identically to all members. Other rate deviations may be\\npermissible provided a plan has been approved by the board. Such\\ndeviations shall not be in excess of ten percent of the actuary's\\nindicated rate unless otherwise approved by the board for a fully funded\\ngroup self-insurer, and shall in no event result in amounts less than\\nthe actuary's overall indicated rate. The chair by regulation may set\\nfurther rate plan and actuarial reporting standards.\\n  (b) If the chair has cause to believe that a group self-insurer's\\ncontribution rates including experience modifications do not conform to\\nthe requirements of this part then he or she may require the submission\\nof a report identifying the contributions paid by each of the members\\nfor the preceding year, the projected contributions for each group\\nself-insurer member for the current fiscal year, and the manner in which\\nsuch contributions were calculated. If, after review by the chair, the\\ngroup self-insurer's contribution rates are deemed to be detrimental to\\nits solvency, the chair may mandate that the group self-insurer modify\\nsuch rates as the chair directs. The chair may impose a penalty of up to\\nfive thousand dollars for each violation of this subparagraph. A group\\nself-insurer's failure to adhere to the rating structure determined by\\nthe board shall constitute good cause for termination.\\n  (7) (a) If for any reason, the status of a group self-insurer under\\nthis subdivision is terminated, including by operation of law on and\\nafter January first, two thousand twelve, the securities or cash or the\\nsurety bond on deposit referred to herein shall remain in the custody of\\nthe chair for such time as the chair may deem proper and warranted. In\\nlieu thereof, and at the discretion of the chair, the group\\nself-insurer, its heirs or assigns or others carrying on or liquidating\\nsuch group self-insurer, including the chair on the group self-insurer's\\nbehalf, may execute an assumption of workers' compensation liability\\ninsurance policy securing such further and future contingent liability\\nas may arise from prior injuries to workers and be incurred by reason of\\nany change in the condition of such workers warranting the board making\\nsubsequent awards for payment of additional compensation. Such policy\\nshall be in a form approved by the superintendent of financial services\\nand issued by the state fund or any insurance company licensed to issue\\nthis class of insurance in this state. In the event that such policy is\\nissued by an insurance company other than the state fund, then said\\npolicy shall be deemed of the kind specified in paragraph fifteen of\\nsubsection (a) of section one thousand one hundred thirteen of the\\ninsurance law and covered by the workers' compensation security fund as\\ncreated and governed by article six-A of this chapter. It shall only be\\nissued for a single complete premium payment in advance by the group\\nself-insurer and in an amount deemed acceptable by the chair and the\\nsuperintendent of financial services.  In lieu of the applicable premium\\ncharge ordinarily required to be imposed by a carrier, said premium\\nshall include a surcharge in an amount to be determined by the chair to:\\n(i) satisfy all assessment liability due and owing to the board and/or\\nthe chair under this chapter; and (ii) satisfy all future assessment\\nliability under this section, and which surcharge shall be adjusted from\\ntime to time to reflect any changes to the assessment of group\\nself-insured employers, including any changes enacted by the chapter of\\nthe laws of two thousand eleven amending sections fifteen and one\\nhundred fifty-one of this chapter. Said surcharge shall be payable to\\nthe board simultaneous to the execution of the assumption of workers'\\ncompensation liability insurance policy. However, the payment of said\\nsurcharge does not relieve the carrier from any other liability,\\nincluding liability owed to the superintendent of financial services\\npursuant to article six-A of this chapter. When issued such policy shall\\nbe noncancellable without recourse for any cause during the continuance\\nof the liability secured and so covered.\\n  (b) The chair shall levy an interim assessment on the members of a\\ndefaulted group self-insurer within one hundred twenty days of such\\ndefault or of the effective date of the chapter of the laws of two\\nthousand eight which amended this subdivision, whichever is later, and\\nagainst the members of any other terminated group self-insurer when\\nnecessary, for such an amount as he or she determines to be necessary to\\ndischarge all liabilities of the group self-insurer, including the\\nreasonable cost of liquidation such as claims administration costs,\\nactuarial and accounting services, and the value of future assessments\\non members of such group self-insurer as they are known at the time of\\nthe assessment. The chair may impose subsequent and further deficit\\nassessments, or return funds to members, to adjust the moneys collected\\nto reflect the time of participation, and percent of group self-insurer\\nliabilities for such time. The time limitations included in the first\\nsentence of this subparagraph do not apply to the imposition of any\\nsubsequent and further deficit assessments that exceed the interim\\nassessment made by the chair against members of a defaulted group\\ninsurer or members of any other terminated group self-insurer.\\nNotwithstanding any such action by the chair, each member of the group\\nself-insurer shall remain jointly and severally responsible for all\\nliabilities provided by this chapter including but not limited to\\noutstanding and estimated future liabilities and assessments. Further,\\nseparate and apart from, and in addition to a member's joint and several\\nliability and notwithstanding any payments made by any other members of\\nthe group self-insurer pursuant to this subparagraph, in the event that\\na member neglects or fails to pay an assessment levied pursuant to this\\nsubparagraph, the member shall be deemed in default in the payment of\\ncompensation. Such defaulting member is subject to the enforcement\\nprovisions of section twenty-six of this chapter for the payment of all\\ncompensation relative to awards due and owing on claims filed by the\\nemployees of such member that have neither been paid by the member or\\nthe group self-insurer. Nothing in this paragraph shall prevent the\\nchair from offering payment plans or settling claims against members of\\nany group self-insurer as necessary to facilitate collection.\\n  (c) Upon the assumption of the assets and liabilities of a group\\nself-insurer by the chair or his or her designee pursuant to regulation\\nof the chair, all records, documents and files of whatever nature,\\npertaining to the group self-insurer, be they in the possession of the\\ngroup self-insurer or a third party, and all remaining assets of the\\ngroup self-insurer, shall become the property of the chair. All\\ncustodians of such records and/or funds shall turn over to the chair or\\nhis designee all such original records upon demand.\\n  (8) All the provisions of this chapter relating to self-insurance and\\nthe rules and regulations promulgated thereunder shall be deemed\\napplicable to group self-insurance. The chair shall implement the\\nprovisions of this subdivision by promulgating rules and regulations but\\nno such rules or regulations shall be necessary for any provision of\\nthis subdivision to be effective. The chair may impose a civil penalty\\nof up to ten thousand dollars for each violation against any group\\nself-insurer that violates any provision of this subdivision or of any\\nregulation issued pursuant thereto for which a civil penalty is not\\nspecified.\\n  (10) (a) A non-municipal group of employers may make application to\\nthe chair to qualify jointly as a self-insurer, provided:\\n  (1) The members of the group secure the services of an administrator,\\nwho shall carry out the responsibilities of such an administrator as set\\nforth in subdivision five of this section, and who shall be subject to\\nthe restrictions and penalties applicable to an administrator under this\\nsection;\\n  (2) The members of the group, through the administrator, (a) jointly\\ndeposit sufficient securities in accordance with subdivision three of\\nthis section or in a trust governed in accordance with Part 126 of title\\n11 of the New York code of rules and regulations to secure the liability\\nof the members of the group to pay for all existing claims obligations,\\nprovided such deposit shall be made by November first, two thousand\\neleven, (b) jointly deposit sufficient securities in accordance with\\nsubdivision three of this section or in a trust governed in accordance\\nwith Part 126 of title 11 of the New York code of rules and regulations\\nto secure all anticipated present and future claims of the members of\\nthe group, by November first, two thousand fourteen, provided annual\\ndeposits are made in accordance with a schedule set by the chair on or\\nbefore November first of each year, and provided that the deposit shall\\nbe deemed an asset of the group for the purpose of determining its\\nfunding status, and (c) by November first, two thousand eleven and\\nthereafter, shall maintain funds sufficient for all other liabilities\\nbesides claims in a trust governed in accordance with Part 126 of title\\n11 of the New York code of rules and regulations, of which the board\\nshall be the sole beneficiary, and the terms of the trust agreement, and\\nthe trustee, shall be approved by the chair in his or her sole\\ndiscretion, and provided that any group self-insurer that does not hold\\nsuch funds in a trust that meets the terms of this paragraph shall post\\nthem with the board;\\n  (3) The group has been authorized by the chair to self-insure in\\naccordance with this subdivision prior to the effective date of this\\nparagraph;\\n  (4) The group's members or participant employers either (a) are\\nparties to collective bargaining agreements with the same unions; or (b)\\nfall within a limited number of payroll classifications, as set by the\\nchair, after giving due consideration to the risks associated with any\\ngroup of employers self-insuring. However, employers that were active\\nprior to the effective date of this section and whose classification\\ncodes do not meet the limitations on payroll classification codes or are\\nnot parties to collective bargaining agreements with the same unions\\nwill be permitted to remain in the trust provided (a) they continue to\\nmeet the other terms and conditions of the trust; and (b) any new\\nmembers shall be subject to the limitations on the number of payroll\\nclassifications; and provided further, the chair shall revoke such\\npermission in the event the trust violates paragraph six of this\\nsubdivision relating to filing of a rating plan;\\n  (5) The group was fully funded for three out of the previous five\\nyears and at least ninety percent funded for one other year out of the\\nprevious five years, as determined by the chair following a financial\\nreview, and the group self-insurer has sufficient funds to meet its\\nliabilities;\\n  (6) The group has a safety program acceptable to the chair; and\\n  (7) The group is subject to such other limitations and requirements of\\nthis subdivision unless waived by the chair and to regulations of the\\nchair.\\n  (b) The members of any such group shall enter into an agreement among\\nthemselves and with the group's administrator which shall, at a minimum:\\n  (1) Indicate that each of the members of the group is jointly and\\nseverally liable for any liabilities of the group; and\\n  (2) Provide for the collection of additional funds from group members\\nin the event the deposit with the board is insufficient to meet the\\nliabilities of the group.\\n  (11) Former group self-insurer. Any group self-insurer that has ceased\\nto self-insure, or has ceased to self-insure any new liabilities after\\nJanuary first, two thousand twelve in accordance with paragraph two of\\nthis subdivision, shall remain subject to all the provisions of this\\nsubdivision and the regulations issued pursuant thereto and any\\nassessments provided for by this section until such time as the group\\nself-insurer no longer possesses any liabilities.\\n  (12) Any non-municipal group of employers authorized to self-insure\\nunder paragraph ten of this section on or after January first, two\\nthousand twelve shall be deemed a \"private self-insurer\" for purposes of\\nthe assessments set forth in sections fifteen and one hundred fifty-one\\nof this chapter.\\n  3-b. (a) Except as provided in subdivision three-d of this section, no\\nperson, firm or corporation, other than an attorney and\\ncounsellor-at-law, shall solicit the business of representing, or engage\\nin representing self-insurers or group self-insurers, as defined in\\nsubdivisions three and three-a of this section, before the board or any\\nofficer, agent or employee of the board assigned to conduct any hearing,\\ninvestigation or inquiry relative to a claim for compensation or\\nbenefits under this chapter, unless he shall be a citizen of the United\\nStates or an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the\\nUnited States, or a corporation organized under the laws of the state of\\nNew York, and shall have obtained from the board a license authorizing\\nhim to appear in matters or proceedings before the board. Such license\\nshall be issued by the board in accordance with the rules established by\\nit. Any person, firm or corporation violating the aforesaid provisions\\nshall be guilty of a misdemeanor. The chair may impose a civil penalty\\nof up to one thousand dollars for each violation against any\\nrepresentative licensed in accordance with this section that violates\\nany provision of this section or of any regulation issued pursuant\\nthereto, in addition to any other sanctions provided for under this\\nchapter.\\n  (b) The board, in its rules, may provide for the issuance of licenses\\nto persons, firms or corporations, upon such proof of character and\\nfitness as it may deem necessary, without annual license fee, and for\\nthe giving of a bond running to the people of the state of New York,\\nconditioned upon the faithful performance of all duties required of such\\nperson, firm or corporation, and in an amount to be fixed by the board\\nin its rules. Such bond shall be approved by the board as to form and\\nsufficiency and shall be filed with it.\\n  (c) There shall be maintained in each office of the board a registry\\nor list of all persons to whom licenses have been issued, as provided\\nherein, which list shall be corrected as often as licenses are issued or\\nrevoked. Absence of record of the license issued, as herein provided,\\nshall be prima facie evidence that a person, firm or corporation is not\\nlicensed to represent self-insurers.\\n  (d) Any such license may be revoked by the board for cause after a\\nhearing before it.\\n  (e) No license shall be issued hereunder for a period longer than\\nthree years from the date of its issuance. The provisions of this\\nsection shall not apply to a regular employee of a self-insured employer\\nor to the state insurance fund acting in accordance with an insuring\\nagreement with the state as authorized pursuant to the provisions of\\nsection eighty-eight-c of this chapter.\\n  3-c.

The state insurance fund, an insurance company duly authorized or\\nlicensed to write workers' compensation insurance in this state, a\\nsubsidiary or an affiliate of such an insurance company, or a licensed\\nor authorized adjusting company or association may apply for a license\\nfrom the board to solicit the business of representing and engage in\\nrepresenting self-insurers, as defined in subdivision three of this\\nsection, before the board or any officer, agent or employee of the board\\nassigned to conduct any hearing, investigation or inquiry relative to a\\nclaim for compensation or benefits under this chapter. Any corporation\\nformed solely for the purpose of engaging in the activities described by\\nthis subdivision shall be formed under the laws of the state of New\\nYork.\\n  The state insurance fund, an insurance company, its subsidiary or\\naffiliate, or such adjusting company or association shall designate\\nthose employees who are to appear in matters or proceedings before the\\nboard on behalf of self-insurers. Such employees shall obtain an\\nauthorization from the board. Upon application to the board for such\\nauthorization all such employees who, on the effective date of this\\nsubdivision, have been appearing in matters or proceedings before the\\nboard on behalf of insurers for a period of at least two years shall\\nautomatically receive a temporary authorization from the board. Such\\ntemporary authorization shall remain in effect until the applicant\\nemployee has been granted or denied final authorization by the board.\\nThe board in its rules shall provide for the issuance of authorizations\\nto such employees and other designated employees. If the board, in its\\nrules, provides for the issuance of authorization to persons, firms or\\ncorporations under subdivision three-b of this section upon such proof\\nof character and fitness as it may deem necessary, the same proof of\\ncharacter and fitness shall be required for an authorization issued\\nunder this subdivision.\\n  The state insurance fund, an insurance company duly authorized or\\nlicensed to write workers' compensation insurance in this state, a\\nsubsidiary or an affiliate of such an insurance company, or a licensed\\nor authorized adjusting company or association shall apply to the board\\nfor the issuance of a license upon such proof of character and fitness\\nas the board may deem necessary. Such proof of character and fitness\\nshall be the same as that required by the board of persons, firms or\\ncorporations under subdivision three-b of this section.

No\\nauthorization or license shall be issued hereunder for a period longer\\nthan three years from the date of its issuance.\\n  The board shall make rules pertaining to when conflicts of interest\\narise in individual cases which shall apply to those who are licensed or\\nauthorized to represent self-insurers under subdivision three-b of this\\nsection or under this subdivision.\\n  The provisions of article twenty-four of the insurance law, insofar as\\napplicable, shall apply to the state insurance fund, insurance\\ncompanies, their subsidiaries and affiliates or adjusting companies or\\nassociations in their activities representing self-insurers before the\\nboard.\\n  3-e. (a) The state insurance fund and any other insurer that issues\\npolicies of workers' compensation insurance shall offer at the option of\\nthe policyholder a deductible for benefits payable under a workers'\\ncompensation policy with an annual premium of twelve thousand dollars or\\nmore, if in the opinion of the state insurance fund or such other\\ninsurer the policyholder meets the eligibility requirements of paragraph\\n(b) of this subdivision.\\n  (b) A policyholder is eligible for a policy deductible for any renewal\\nperiod of the policy if such policyholder has paid the entire billed\\npremium on the policy for all policy periods within forty-five days of\\neach billing for the past three years. A policyholder will continue to\\nbe eligible for a deductible provided that no part of any premium is\\nmore than forty-five days overdue from the date billed or reimbursement\\nfor any deductible amount is unpaid by the policyholder to such insurer.\\nThe state insurance fund or any other insurer that has issued a policy\\nwith a deductible may revoke the policyholder's entitlement to a\\ndeductible if the policyholder fails to reimburse any deductible\\namounts, or pay any billed premium, within forty-five days after such\\nreimbursement or premium payment has become due. Upon such revocation of\\na policyholder's entitlement to a deductible, the policyholder shall be\\nentitled to cancel such policy and such policyholder will forfeit\\neligibility for entitlement to a deductible as provided above.\\n  (c) Deductibles shall be offered by the state insurance fund or any\\nother insurer in writing to eligible policyholders at the beginning of\\npolicy periods, in the amounts of one hundred dollars, two hundred\\ndollars, three hundred dollars, four hundred dollars and five hundred\\ndollars, and thereafter, in increments of five hundred dollars up to a\\nmaximum of two thousand five hundred dollars per occurrence. The\\neligible policyholder shall select, in writing, only one deductible\\namount which shall be binding on such policyholder throughout the policy\\nperiod.\\n  (d) If the policyholder selects a deductible under paragraph (c) of\\nthis subdivision, workers' compensation benefits payable under the\\npolicy shall be paid by the state insurance fund or other insurer liable\\nunder the policy to the person or provider entitled to such benefits\\nwithout regard to any deductible applied to such policy. Upon payment of\\nbenefits on a claim up to or exceeding the deductible amount, the state\\ninsurance fund or other insurer shall be entitled to bill the\\npolicyholder for reimbursement up to the deductible amount. A\\npolicyholder's failure to pay billed deductible reimbursement amounts to\\nthe state insurance fund or other insurer under this paragraph shall be\\ntreated in the same manner as non-payment of premium and render the\\npolicy cancelable in accordance with the provisions of subdivision five\\nof section fifty-four of this article. The deductibles paid by the\\ninsured employer during any one year period of the policy of insurance\\nshall not exceed the annual premium for such policy of insurance.\\n  (e) Premium reductions, in accordance with methodology approved by the\\nsuperintendent of financial services shall be applied to any policy\\nwritten with a deductible. Such premium reductions shall be determined\\nbefore the application of any experience modification premium surcharge\\nor premium discount.\\n  (f) The New York workers' compensation rating board shall file for\\nappropriate premium discounts subject to the approval of the\\nsuperintendent of financial services.\\n  (g) The state insurance fund, any other insurer or any group\\nself-insurer for municipal corporations as defined in subdivision\\nthree-a of this section may, at its option, offer a deductible in an\\namount specified in paragraph (c) of this subdivision to any\\npolicyholder who is not otherwise eligible for a deductible under this\\nsubdivision.\\n  4. a.

If compensation is not so\\nsecured, a county, city, village, town, school district, fire district\\nor other political subdivision shall be deemed to have elected to secure\\ncompensation pursuant to subdivision three of this section and, in such\\ncase, no proof of financial ability or deposit of securities or cash\\nneed be made in compliance with such subdivision. All other requirements\\nprescribed by this chapter for employers so electing shall be complied\\nwith and notice of such election shall be filed with the chair. For\\nfailure to file such notice of election, prescribed in form by the\\nchair, within ten days after the election was made, the treasurer or\\nother financial officer shall be liable to pay to the chair the sum of\\none hundred dollars as a penalty, to be transferred to the state\\ntreasury.\\n  b. The treasurer or other fiscal officer of a self-insuring county,\\ncity, village, town, school district, fire district or other political\\nsubdivision shall, upon presentation of an award of compensation\\nforthwith begin payment of it to the person entitled thereto in\\naccordance with this chapter.\\n  c. The governing board of a county, city, village, town, school\\ndistrict, fire district or other political subdivision may authorize the\\ntreasurer or other fiscal officer of such municipal corporation,\\ndistrict or political subdivision, as the case may be, to pay the\\ncompensation provided for in this chapter to the person entitled thereto\\nwithout waiting for an award in any case in the manner provided in\\nsection twenty-five of this chapter. The amount of such compensation\\npayable prior to an award pursuant to such authorization shall\\nconstitute a settled claim within the meaning of the local finance law.\\n  d. A contract of insurance issued to a county or a town in accordance\\nwith subdivision one or two of this section and in force on or after the\\nfirst day of March, nineteen hundred sixty-three, in relation to fire\\ndistricts and on or after the first day of January, in the year in which\\nthis paragraph as hereby amended becomes effective in relation to\\nambulance districts shall contain a provision reading as follows: \"This\\ncontract does not provide (1) any coverage under the Workers'\\nCompensation Law or the Volunteer Firefighters' Benefit Law or the\\nVolunteer Ambulance Workers' Benefit Law for which any fire district or\\nambulance district would be liable under such laws, (2) any workers'\\ncompensation benefits for fire or ambulance district officers and\\nemployees for which any fire district or ambulance district would be\\nliable under the Workers' Compensation Law, or (3) any volunteer\\nfirefighters' or ambulance workers' benefits for any volunteer\\nfirefighters or volunteer ambulance workers under the Volunteer\\nFirefighters' Benefit Law or the Volunteer Ambulance Workers' Benefit\\nLaw\".\\n  e. If for any reason the status of a county, city, village, town,\\nschool district, fire district or other political subdivision of state\\nis terminated, at the discretion of the chair, the county, city,\\nvillage, town, school district, fire district or other political\\nsubdivision of state, may execute an assumption of workers' compensation\\nliability insurance policy securing such further and future contingent\\nliability as may arise from prior injuries to workers and be incurred by\\nreason of any change in the condition of such workers warranting the\\nboard making subsequent awards for payment of additional compensation.\\nSuch policy shall be in a form approved by the superintendent of\\nfinancial services and shall be issued by the state fund or any\\ninsurance company licensed to issue this class of policy in this state.\\nIn the event that such policy is issued by an insurance company other\\nthan the state fund, then said policy shall be deemed to be insurance of\\nthe kind specified in paragraph fifteen of subsection (a) of section one\\nthousand one hundred thirteen of the insurance law and covered by the\\nworkers' compensation security fund as created and governed by article\\nsix-A of this chapter.  It shall only be issued for a single complete\\npremium payment in advance by the county, city, village, town, school\\ndistrict, fire district or other political subdivision of state and in\\nan amount deemed acceptable by the chair and the superintendent of\\nfinancial services. In lieu of the applicable premium charge ordinarily\\nrequired to be imposed by a carrier, said premium shall include a\\nsurcharge in an amount to be determined by the chair to satisfy all\\nassessment liability due and owing to the board and/or the chair under\\nthis chapter. Said surcharge shall be payable to the board simultaneous\\nto the execution of the assumption of workers' compensation liability\\ninsurance policy. However, the payment of said surcharge does not\\nrelieve the carrier from any other liability, including liability owed\\nto the superintendent of financial services pursuant to article six-A of\\nthis chapter. When issued such policy shall be non-cancellable without\\nrecourse for any cause during the continuance of the liability secured\\nand so covered.\\n  5.

Three of such members shall be named from the\\nmanufacturing and trade group of self-insurance, three from the\\ntransportation, public utilities and construction group, and one member\\nshall be a self-insurer selected at large by the chairman, who shall be\\nvice-chairman of the advisory committee. The chair shall be chair of the\\nadvisory committee; the secretary of the board shall act as secretary of\\nthe advisory committee. Any member appointed to such advisory committee\\nshall be a self-insurer or an officer of a self-insurer or a person who\\non account of his or her employment or affiliation can be classed as a\\nmanagement representative of a self-insurer. The members of the advisory\\ncommittee for self-insurance in office at the time this subdivision\\ntakes effect, shall be and they are hereby continued in office as such\\nfor the remainder of the terms for which they were appointed\\nrespectively.\\n  The members of the advisory committee for self-insurance next\\nappointed, except to fill a vacancy created otherwise than by expiration\\nof term, shall be appointed for terms of three years, except that of the\\nthree additional members to be appointed after May first, two thousand\\neight, one such member shall be appointed for an initial term of one\\nyear, one such member shall be appointed for an initial term of two\\nyears, and one such member shall be appointed for an initial term of\\nthree years. No member shall be appointed to the advisory committee for\\nindividual self-insurance if he or she has been convicted of a crime\\nunder this chapter or has been subject to criminal or civil penalties\\nunder this subdivision. Vacancies shall be filled for the unexpired term\\nby appointment by the chair. Members shall continue in office until\\ntheir successors are appointed; in the event that no appointment is made\\nwithin three months after a vacancy exists or after the expiration of\\nthe term of a member, the remaining members may fill the vacancy by a\\nmajority vote. If a member shall be absent from two consecutive regular\\nmeetings without adequate excuse his or her place may be declared vacant\\nby the chair. Members of such advisory committee shall serve without\\npay, but shall be entitled to their reasonable and necessary traveling\\nand other expenses incurred in connection with their duties. Regular\\nmeetings of the advisory committee shall be held twice a year, on dates\\nto be fixed by the chair. In addition, special meetings shall be held if\\ncalled by the chair or any five members of the committee. Such advisory\\ncommittee shall have access to all self-insurance records except those\\nrestricted by the chair or those whose disclosure is restricted under\\nsection one hundred ten-a of this chapter, and shall have the power to\\nrequire the presence before it of any employee of the board or any\\nself-insurer as reasonable and related to matters within the purview of\\nthe committee. Information obtained by members of the advisory committee\\nshall be deemed confidential unless disclosed by order of the committee.\\nIt shall be the duty of the advisory committee to advise the chair on\\nall matters relating to self-insurance, particularly in respect to rules\\ngoverning self-insurance, the deposit or withdrawal of securities, the\\nstandards for permitting employers to self-insure under this section,\\nthe appropriate amount of security or payments that self-insured\\nemployers must provide, and on such other matters as the chair shall\\nrequest. The chair shall detail to such advisory committee such\\nstenographic or other assistance as may be necessary. Minutes shall be\\nkept of the meetings of the advisory committee and shall be provided\\nwithin forty-five days of such meeting to the governor and legislature,\\nincluding the chairs of the assembly and senate committees on insurance\\nand labor.\\n  c. (1) The chair and the department of audit and control as soon as\\npracticable after May first, nineteen hundred sixty, and annually\\nthereafter, as soon as practicable after April first in each succeeding\\nyear, shall ascertain the total amount of net expenses, including (a)\\nadministrative expenses, which shall include the direct costs of\\npersonal services, the cost of maintenance and operation, the cost of\\nretirement contributions made and workers' compensation premiums paid by\\nthe State for or on account of personnel, rentals for space occupied in\\nstate owned or state leased buildings, and (b) all direct or indirect\\ncosts incurred by the board during the preceding fiscal year in carrying\\nout the provisions of subdivision three and three-a of this section.\\nSuch expenses shall be adjusted annually to reflect any change in\\ncircumstances, and shall be assessed against all private self-insured\\nemployers, including for this purpose active and terminated group\\nself-insurers, active individual self-insured employers, and individual\\nself-insured employers who have ceased to exercise the privilege of\\nself-insurance.\\n  (2) Such expenses shall be assessed against all self-insurers\\nincluding for this purpose employers who have ceased to exercise the\\nprivilege of self-insurance. The basis of apportionment of the\\nassessment against each self-insurer shall be a sum equal to that\\nproportion of the amount which the indemnity payment for each\\nself-insurer bore to the total indemnity payments for all self-insurers\\nfor the calendar year which ended within the preceding state fiscal\\nyear. All such assessments when collected shall be deposited into a fund\\nwhich shall be used to reimburse the appropriations theretofore made by\\nthe state for the payment of the expenses of administering this chapter.\\n  (3) Pure premium for assessments made prior to January first, two\\nthousand nine against individual and group self-insurers who ceased to\\nself-insure shall be based on payroll at the time the individual or\\ngroup self-insurer has ceased to self-insure, reduced by a factor\\nreflecting the reduction in the group or individual self-insurer's\\nself-insurance liabilities since ceasing to self-insure.\\n  d. The chair may from time to time request the superintendent of\\nfinancial services for assistance, and the superintendent of financial\\nservices is hereby authorized to render such assistance upon request of\\nthe chair, as may be necessary to insure the financial ability of such\\ngroup self-insurers to pay all liabilities provided by this chapter.\\n  e. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph c of this subdivision,\\nthe chair shall require that partial payments for expenses of the fiscal\\nyear beginning April first, nineteen hundred eighty-three, and for each\\nfiscal year thereafter shall be made on March tenth of the preceding\\nfiscal year and on June tenth, September tenth, and December tenth of\\neach year, or on such other dates as the director of the budget may\\nprescribe, by each self-insurer. Provided, however, that the payment due\\nMarch tenth, nineteen hundred eighty-three for the fiscal year beginning\\nApril first, nineteen hundred eighty-three shall not be required to be\\npaid until June tenth, nineteen hundred eighty-three. Each such payment\\nshall be a sum equal to twenty-five per centum of the annual expenses\\nassessed upon each self-insurer, as estimated by the chair. The balance\\nof assessments for the fiscal year beginning April first, nineteen\\nhundred seventy-three and each fiscal year thereafter, shall be paid\\nupon determination of the actual amount due in accordance with the\\nprovisions of paragraph c of this subdivision. Any overpayment of annual\\nassessments resulting from the requirements of this paragraph shall be\\nrefunded or at the option of the chair shall be applied as a credit\\nagainst the assessment of the succeeding fiscal year. The requirements\\nof this subdivision shall not apply to those self-insurers whose\\nestimated annual assessment for the fiscal year is less than one hundred\\ndollars and such self-insurers shall make a single payment of the\\nestimated annual assessment on or before September thirtieth of the\\nfiscal year.\\n  f. Whenever the chair shall determine that the compensation and\\nbenefits provided by this chapter may be unpaid by reason of the default\\nof an insolvent private self-insured employer, including a private group\\nself-insurer, the chair shall pay such compensation and benefits from\\nadministration expenses as provided in section one hundred fifty-one of\\nthis chapter upon audit and warrant of the comptroller upon vouchers\\napproved by the chair. Such payments shall be considered expenses of\\nadministration. The chair shall be reimbursed therefor from the surety\\nbond, cash or securities held or, if such surety bond, securities or\\ncash is insufficient, by the employer, its receiver, liquidator,\\nrehabilitator or trustee in bankruptcy. All moneys reimbursed to the\\nchair or recovered by the chair in an action or proceeding to secure\\nsuch reimbursement shall forthwith be applied as a credit against the\\nexpenses on which the assessment levied upon all private self-insured\\nemployers, in accordance with paragraphs c and e of this subdivision, is\\ncalculated.\\n  g. Whenever the chair shall determine that the compensation and\\nbenefits provided by this chapter may be unpaid by reason of the default\\nof an insolvent private self-insured employer, including a private group\\nself-insurer, the chair shall levy an assessment against all private\\nself-insured employers, including private group self-insurers, in\\naccordance with paragraphs c and e of this subdivision to assure prompt\\npayment of such compensation and benefits. Whenever compensation and\\nbenefits are unpaid by reason of such default, the chair shall promptly\\npay such compensation and benefits from administration expenses as\\nprovided in section one hundred fifty-one of this chapter upon audit and\\nwarrant of the comptroller upon vouchers approved by the chair. Nothing\\nin this paragraph shall preclude the chair from recovering the moneys it\\nexpends from its administrative expenses against the defaulted\\nindividual self-insurer, or the members of the defaulted group\\nself-insurer, as otherwise permitted by this chapter.\\n  6. Any policy of insurance purchased pursuant to the provisions of\\nthis subdivision six as in effect prior to the first day of March,\\nnineteen hundred fifty-seven, shall be cancelled prior to, or as of, the\\ntwenty-eighth day of February, nineteen hundred fifty-seven.\\n  The cost of such insurance shall be apportioned by the clerk of the\\nboard of supervisors of the county to each such city, village, fire\\ndistrict, fire protection district, fire alarm district, and territory\\noutside such municipal corporations and districts, in the proportion\\nthat the agreed population bears to the entire population of the group.\\nRefunds, dividends and discounts in relation to such insurance shall be\\ndistributed or credited according to the same apportionment. Upon\\nnotification by the clerk of the board of supervisors, the chief fiscal\\nofficer of each such city, village or fire district shall pay to the\\ncounty treasurer, from moneys available or made available, the amount\\napportioned to such city, village or district. Upon like notification,\\nthe supervisor of each town in which a fire protection district or fire\\nalarm district is located in whole or in part, or in which outside\\nterritory is located, shall pay to the county treasurer the amount\\napportioned for such district, in whole or in part, or territory, as the\\ncase may be, using moneys raised or made available for the purposes of\\nfire protection in such district or outside territory, or if there be no\\nsuch moneys or insufficient moneys, using funds of the town available or\\nmade available, which funds shall be a charge upon such district or\\nterritory for which the town shall be reimbursed. The county treasurer\\nshall pay the cost of such insurance with such moneys, or if any\\napportioned share has not been paid, the county treasurer shall advance\\nthe amount necessary from moneys of the general fund upon resolution of\\nthe board of supervisors. Any such advance shall be repaid as soon as\\nmoneys are available therefor. If any apportioned share remains unpaid,\\nthe county may recover the same by action at law. If any member of the\\ngroup shall fail to pay its apportioned share within thirty days after\\nnotice that such amount has become due and payable, the chairman of the\\nboard of supervisors may terminate the participation of such member in\\nthe group by notice by mail to such member on a date specified in the\\nnotice, and a copy of such notice shall be filed by the chairman of the\\nboard of supervisors with the insurance carrier, who shall notify the\\nchairman of the workmen's compensation board of the termination of\\ncoverage in the same manner as provided for cancellation of policy under\\nsubdivision five of section fifty-four of this chapter.\\n  If any participating fire protection district or fire alarm district\\nincludes territory in more than one town, whether or not in more than\\none county, the amount of cost of insurance, refund, dividend or\\ndiscount apportioned to such district shall be apportioned in the\\nproportion that the population of the district within each such town\\nbears to the population of the entire district. The figure used for\\npopulation in such case shall be the one stated in the agreement.\\n  7. Any policy of insurance purchased pursuant to the provisions of\\nthis subdivision seven as in effect prior to the first day of March,\\nnineteen hundred fifty-seven, shall be cancelled prior to, or as of, the\\nclose of the twenty-eighth day of February, nineteen hundred\\nfifty-seven. The cost of such insurance shall be a town charge and shall\\nbe levied and collected in the same manner as other town charges only in\\nthe territory of such town outside of any villages and fire districts\\nnot covered by such a policy.\\n  8.

In the case of a\\npolicy with multiple insurers, such insurers shall share one hundred\\npercent of the liabilities by subscription, and one of the insurers\\nshall serve as the lead insurer for notice and cancellation purposes.\\nSuch a policy shall contain a provision setting forth the right of the\\nchair to enforce in the name of the people of the state of New York for\\nthe benefit of the person entitled to the compensation insured by the\\npolicy either by filing a separate application or by making the\\ninsurance carrier a party to the original application, the liability of\\nthe insurance carrier in whole or in part for the payment of such\\ncompensation; provided, however, that payment in whole or in part of\\nsuch compensation by either the employer or the insurance carrier shall\\nto the extent thereof be a bar to the recovery against the other of the\\namount so paid.\\n  2. Knowledge and jurisdiction of the employer extended to cover the\\ninsurance carrier. Every such policy shall contain a provision that, as\\nbetween the employee and the insurance carrier, the notice to or\\nknowledge of the occurrence of the injury on the part of the employer\\nshall be deemed notice or knowledge, as the case may be, on the part of\\nthe insurance carrier, or if more than one insurer, the lead carrier;\\nthat jurisdiction of the employer shall, for the purpose of this\\nchapter, be jurisdiction of the lead insurance carrier and that such\\ninsurance carrier shall in all things be bound by and subject to the\\norders, findings, decisions or awards rendered against the employer for\\nthe payment of compensation under the provisions of this chapter.\\n  3. Insolvency of employer does not release the insurance carrier.\\nEvery such policy shall contain a provision to the effect that the\\ninsolvency or bankruptcy of the employer shall not relieve the insurance\\ncarrier from the payment of compensation for injuries or death sustained\\nby an employee during the life of such policy.\\n  4. Limitation of indemnity agreements. Every contract or agreement of\\nan employer the purpose of which is to indemnify him from loss or damage\\non account of the injury of an employee by accidental means, or on\\naccount of the negligence of such employer or his officer, agent or\\nservant, shall be absolutely void unless it shall also cover liability\\nfor the payment of the compensation and for the payment into the special\\nfunds provided for by this chapter.

No insurer\\nshall refuse to renew any policy insuring against liability arising\\nunder this chapter unless at least thirty days prior to its expiration\\nnotice of intention not to renew has been filed in the office of the\\nchair and also served on the employer.\\n  Such notice shall be served on the employer by delivering it to him,\\nher or it or by sending it by mail, by certified or registered letter,\\nreturn receipt requested, addressed to the employer at his, her or its\\nlast known place of business; provided that, if the employer be a\\npartnership, then such notice may be so given to any of one of the\\npartners, and if the employer be a corporation then the notice may be\\ngiven to any agent or officer of the corporation upon whom legal process\\nmay be served; and further provided that an employer may designate any\\nperson or entity at any address to receive such notice including the\\ndesignation of one person or entity to receive notice on behalf of\\nmultiple entities insured under one insurance policy and that service of\\nnotice at the address so designated upon the person or entity so\\ndesignated by delivery or by mail, by certified or registered letter,\\nreturn receipt requested, shall satisfy the notice requirement of this\\nsection. Provided, however, the right to cancellation of a policy of\\ninsurance in the state fund shall be exercised only for non-payment of\\npremiums and assessments or as provided in section ninety-four of this\\nchapter.\\n  The provisions of this subdivision shall not apply with respect to\\npolicies containing coverage pursuant to subsection (j) of section three\\nthousand four hundred twenty of the insurance law relating to every\\npolicy providing comprehensive personal liability insurance on a one,\\ntwo, three or four family owner-occupied dwelling.\\n  In the event such cancellation or termination notice is not filed with\\nthe chair within the required time period, the chair shall impose a\\npenalty in the amount of up to five hundred dollars for each ten-day\\nperiod the insurance carrier or state insurance fund failed to file the\\nnotification. All penalties collected pursuant to this subdivision shall\\nbe deposited in the uninsured employers' fund.\\n  (b) Conditional renewal for carriers under common control. A contract\\nof insurance shall remain in full force and effect subject to the same\\nrates as the expiring contract of insurance rates, unless written notice\\nis mailed or delivered by the insurance carrier to the employer, at the\\naddress shown on the policy, and to such employer's authorized agent or\\nbroker, indicating the insurance carrier's intention to condition\\nrenewal upon issuance of a policy that supersedes a policy previously\\nissued by another insurance carrier under common control that will\\nresult in an increased premium in excess of ten percent (exclusive of\\nany premium increase generated as a result of increased loss costs filed\\nand approved in accordance with subsection (e) of section two thousand\\nthree hundred five of the insurance law, increased exposure units, or as\\na result of experience rating, contractor credit adjustment program,\\nmerit rating, retrospective rating or audit or removal or reduction of a\\ndrug free credit, managed care credit, or deductible.

Issuance, amendment, endorsement or reinstatement of insurance\\ncontracts. a. Any insurance carrier or the state insurance fund who\\nissues, reinstates, amends or endorses any contract of insurance or\\nrider thereto covering the liability of an employer for compensation\\nunder this chapter shall file notification in the office of the chair\\nwithin thirty days after such issuance, reinstatement, amendment, or\\nendorsement of the contract. Such notice shall be filed in the manner\\nand form prescribed by the chair.\\n  b.

All penalties collected pursuant\\nto this subdivision shall be deposited in the uninsured employers' fund.\\n  c. The provisions of this subdivision shall not apply with respect to\\ninsurance policies containing coverage pursuant to subsection (j) of\\nsection three thousand four hundred twenty of the insurance law relating\\nto every policy providing comprehensive personal liability insurance on\\na one, two, three or four family owner-occupied dwelling.\\n  6. a. Insurance of officers of corporations. Every executive officer\\nof a corporation shall be deemed to be included in the compensation\\ninsurance contract or covered under a certificate of self-insurance\\nunless that person is an unsalaried executive officer of a\\nnot-for-profit corporation or unincorporated association and such\\ncorporation or association elects to exclude that person from the\\ncoverage of this chapter.

It shall be unlawful for any\\nemployer or his or her duly authorized agent to discharge or fail to\\nreinstate pursuant to section two hundred three-b of this chapter, or in\\nany other manner discriminate against an employee as to his or her\\nemployment because such employee has claimed or attempted to claim\\ncompensation from such employer, requested a claim form for injuries\\nreceived in the course of employment, or claimed or attempted to claim\\nany benefits provided under this chapter or because he or she has\\ntestified or is about to testify in a proceeding under this chapter and\\nno other valid reason is shown to exist for such action by the employer.\\n  Any complaint alleging such an unlawful discriminatory practice must\\nbe filed within two years of the commission of such practice. Upon\\nfinding that an employer has violated this section, the board shall make\\nan order that any employee so discriminated against shall be restored to\\nemployment or otherwise restored to the position or privileges he or she\\nwould have had but for the discrimination and shall be compensated by\\nhis or her employer for any loss of compensation arising out of such\\ndiscrimination together with such fees or allowances for services\\nrendered by an attorney or licensed representative as fixed by the\\nboard.

Any and all records required by law to be kept by such\\nemployer upon which the employer makes or files a return concerning\\nwages paid to employees shall form part of the records described in this\\nsection and shall be open to inspection in the same manner as provided\\nin this section. Any employer who shall fail to keep such records, who\\nshall willfully fail to furnish such record as required in this section\\nor who shall falsify any such records, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor\\nand subject to a fine of not less than five nor more than ten thousand\\ndollars in addition to any other penalties otherwise provided by law,\\nexcept that any such employer that has previously been subject to\\ncriminal penalties under this section within the prior ten years shall\\nbe guilty of a class E felony, and subject to a fine of not less than\\nten nor more than twenty-five thousand dollars in addition to any\\npenalties otherwise provided by law.\\n  (2) Employers subject to subsection (e) of section two thousand three\\nhundred four of the insurance law and subdivision two of section\\neighty-nine of this chapter shall keep a true and accurate record of\\nhours worked for all construction classification employees.

Such subpoenas may be served without the\\nstate on any defendant over whom a New York court would have personal\\njurisdiction under the civil practice law and rules as to the subject\\nmatter under investigation, provided the information or testimony sought\\nbears a reasonable relationship to the subject matter under\\ninvestigation.\\n  2. The chair shall specify by rule the business records that employers\\nmust maintain and produce to comply with this section.\\n  3. If a person has refused to obey a subpoena, the chair may commence\\nan action in supreme court of any county where venue is proper for an\\norder requiring compliance with the subpoena. Costs, including\\nreasonable attorney's fees, incurred by the chair to obtain and enforce\\nan order granting, in whole or in part, a petition to enforce a subpoena\\nshall be taxed against the subpoenaed party.\\n  4. (a) Whenever the chair determines that an employer who is required\\nto secure compensation in accordance with this chapter has failed to\\nsecure such compensation, or where an employer has failed to pay\\npenalties assessed against it pursuant to this chapter, or failed to pay\\na judgment under section twenty-six of this chapter within ninety days\\nafter notice to the employer and has not moved to modify or vacate such\\njudgment, such failure shall be deemed an immediate serious danger to\\npublic health, safety, or welfare sufficient to justify service by the\\nchair of a stop-work order on the employer, requiring the cessation of\\nall business operations effective immediately, except where the\\nemployer's failure concerns only domestic or child care workers in his\\nor her own household. The chair may issue such order, which shall take\\neffect as to a particular employer worksite when served at that\\nworksite, or as to all employer worksites in the state for which the\\nemployer is not in compliance when served on the employer. A stop-work\\norder may be served with regard to an employer's worksite by posting a\\ncopy of the stop-work order in a conspicuous location at the worksite.\\nThe order shall remain in effect until the chair directs that the\\nstop-work order be removed, upon a determination that the employer has\\ncome into compliance with the coverage requirements of this chapter and\\nhas paid any penalty assessed under this chapter. If the employer shall\\nwithin thirty days after notice of the stop-work order make an\\napplication in affidavit form for a redetermination review of such order\\nthe chair shall make a decision in writing on the issues raised in such\\napplication. The chair may direct a conditional release from a stop-work\\norder upon a finding that the employer has complied with coverage\\nrequirements of this chapter and has agreed to remit periodic payments\\nof the penalty pursuant to a payment agreement schedule with the chair.\\nIf an agreement or order of conditional release is issued, failure by\\nthe employer to meet any term or condition of such payment agreement\\nshall result in the immediate reinstatement of the stop-work order and\\nthe entire unpaid balance of the penalty shall become immediately due.\\nThe chair may require an employer who is found to have failed to comply\\nwith the coverage requirements of this chapter to file with the board,\\nas a condition of release from a stop-work order, periodic reports for a\\nprobationary period that shall not exceed two years, and that\\ndemonstrate the employer's continued compliance with this chapter. The\\nboard shall by rule specify the reports required and the time for filing\\nunder this subdivision.\\n  (b) A stop-work order issued against an employer under this section\\nshall be in effect against any non-compliant substantially-owned\\naffiliated entity.\\n  5. The chair may file a complaint in the supreme court of any county\\nwhere venue is proper: (a) to enjoin any employer from violating a\\nstop-work order; or (b) to enjoin any other practice prohibited by\\nsection fifty-two or one hundred thirty-one of this chapter. In any\\naction brought by the chair pursuant to this section in which it\\nprevails, the court may award costs, including the reasonable costs of\\ninvestigation and reasonable attorneys' fees.\\n  6. Any judgment obtained by the chair and any penalty due under this\\nsection shall, until collected, constitute a lien upon the entire\\ninterest of the employer, legal or equitable, in any property, real or\\npersonal, tangible or intangible; however, such lien is subordinate to\\nclaims for unpaid wages and any prior recorded liens, and a lien created\\nby this section is not valid against any person who, subsequent to such\\nlien and in good faith and for value, purchases real or personal\\nproperty from such employer or becomes the mortgagee on real or personal\\nproperty of such employer, or against a subsequent attaching creditor,\\nunless, with respect to real estate of the employer, a notice of the\\nlien is recorded in the public records of the county where the real\\nestate is located, and with respect to personal property of the\\nemployer, the notice is recorded with the secretary of state.\\n  7.

An\\nemployee whose employment with a covered employer is terminated and who\\nwas in employment of one or more covered employers and was paid wages of\\nat least thirteen dollars in such employment in each of twenty calendar\\nweeks during the thirty calendar weeks immediately preceding the date he\\nlast worked for such covered employer, and who during a period of\\nunemployment within twenty-six weeks immediately following such\\ntermination of employment is not eligible to benefits under the\\nunemployment insurance law because of lack of qualifying wages but who\\nduring unemployment has evidenced his continued attachment to the labor\\nmarket, shall be eligible for benefits under the provisions of this\\nsubdivision for disability commencing after June thirtieth, nineteen\\nhundred fifty. If such employee becomes disabled and continues to be\\ndisabled for at least eight consecutive days during such twenty-six week\\nperiod and on the day such disability commences he is not employed or\\nworking for remuneration or profit and is not then otherwise eligible\\nfor benefits under this article, he shall be entitled to receive\\ndisability benefits, as herein provided, beginning with the eighth\\nconsecutive day of such disability, for each week of such disability\\nthereafter.

If an employee entitled to disability benefits under\\nthis article be disabled by injury caused by the negligence or wrong of\\na third party, such employee need not elect whether to take such\\ndisability benefits or to pursue his remedy against such third party,\\nbut may take his benefits under this article. The carrier liable for\\npayment of disability benefits under this article or the chairman in\\ncase of benefits paid under section two hundred seven or two hundred\\nthirteen shall have a lien on the proceeds of any recovery from such\\nthird party, whether by judgment, settlement or otherwise, after the\\ndeduction of reasonable and necessary expenditures, including attorneys'\\nfees, incurred in effecting such recovery, to the extent of the total\\namount of disability benefits provided by this article and paid, and to\\nsuch extent such recovery shall be deemed for the benefit of such\\ncarrier or the chairman. Should the employee secure a recovery from such\\nthird party, whether by judgment, settlement or otherwise, such employee\\nmay apply on notice to such lienor to the court in which the third party\\naction was instituted, or to a court of competent jurisdiction if no\\naction was instituted, for an order apportioning the reasonable and\\nnecessary expenditures, including attorneys' fees, incurred in effecting\\nsuch recovery. Such expenditures shall be equitably apportioned by the\\ncourt between the employee and the lienor. Notice of the commencement of\\nsuch action shall be given within ninety days thereafter to the employer\\nor carrier or to the chairman, as the case may be. The foregoing rights,\\nlimitations, and procedures shall also apply to actions and recoveries\\nunder the employers' liability act, and section six hundred\\neighty-eight, title forty-six, United States code, and under the\\nmaritime doctrine of wages, maintenance and cure.

The sole remedy of any of the foregoing providers to recover the\\npayments in the situation specified in the preceding sentence shall be\\npursuant to the settlement procedures contained in section five thousand\\none hundred five of the insurance law.\\n  2. If such disabled employee has been paid disability benefits under\\nthis article but has failed to commence action against such other within\\nsix months prior to the expiration of the statute of limitations, the\\ncarrier or the chairman, as the case may be, may maintain an action\\nagainst such third party. If the carrier or the chairman, as the case\\nmay be, having paid disability benefits to a disabled employee, who is\\nalso a \"covered person\" (as defined in subsection (j) of section five\\nthousand one hundred two of the insurance law), and who was injured in a\\nmotor vehicle accident in this state on and after December first,\\nnineteen hundred seventy-seven and before July first, nineteen hundred\\nseventy-eight, maintains an action against such third party, who is also\\na \"covered person\", and recovers, whether by judgment, settlement or\\notherwise, it shall advise the disabled employee, by certified mail, in\\na manner to be approved by the chairman and the superintendent of\\nfinancial services, of the responsibility of an \"insurer\" (as defined in\\nsubsection (g) of section five thousand one hundred two of the insurance\\nlaw) to further compensate such disabled employee.\\n  2-a.

The sole remedy of any of the foregoing\\nproviders to recover the payments in the situation specified in the\\npreceding sentence when the other party is a \"covered person\" shall be\\npursuant to the settlement procedures contained in section five thousand\\none hundred five of the insurance law.\\n  3.

The governor of this state, in\\na special message to the legislature on January eighth, nineteen hundred\\nfifty-one, recommended a program for the defense of the people of our\\nstate and the safeguarding of property against attack.  In order to make\\neffective necessary measures of civil defense, many of our citizens will\\nvoluntarily undertake to perform civil defense duties and may, in the\\nevent of attack, be exposed to injury in the performance of authorized\\ncivil defense duties they voluntarily assumed as a patriotic service for\\nthe common good.\\n  Those who volunteer to perform civil defense duties deserve some\\nprotection for themselves and their families in the event that\\ndisability or death should be incurred while they are performing these\\nduties. No such benefits have yet been provided by the federal\\ngovernment. Accordingly it is hereby declared to be the intent of the\\nlegislature that special workmen's compensation benefits, as provided in\\nthis article, should be made available for civil defense volunteers in\\nthis state.\\n",
