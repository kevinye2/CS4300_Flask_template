A reporting individual who knowingly and wilfully fails to file\\n    an annual statement of financial disclosure or who knowingly and\\n    wilfully with intent to deceive makes a false statement or gives\\n    information which such individual knows to be false on such\\n    statement of financial disclosure filed pursuant to this section\\n    shall be subject to a civil penalty in an amount not to exceed forty\\n    thousand dollars. Assessment of a civil penalty hereunder shall be\\n    made by the joint commission on public ethics or by the legislative\\n    ethics commission, as the case may be, with respect to persons\\n    subject to their respective jurisdictions.  The joint commission on\\n    public ethics acting pursuant to subdivision fourteen of section\\n    ninety-four of the executive law or the legislative ethics\\n    commission acting pursuant to subdivision eleven of section eighty\\n    of the legislative law, as the case may be, may, in lieu of or in\\n    addition to a civil penalty, refer a violation to the appropriate\\n    prosecutor and upon such conviction, but only after such referral,\\n    such violation shall be punishable as a class A misdemeanor. A civil\\n    penalty for false filing may not be imposed hereunder in the event a\\n    category of \"value\" or \"amount\" reported hereunder is incorrect\\n    unless such reported information is falsely understated.\\n    Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, no other\\n    penalty, civil or criminal may be imposed for a failure to file, or\\n    for a false filing, of such statement, except that the appointing\\n    authority may impose disciplinary action as otherwise provided by\\n    law. The joint commission on public ethics and the legislative\\n    ethics commission shall each be deemed to be an agency within the\\n    meaning of article three of the state administrative procedure act\\n    and shall adopt rules governing the conduct of adjudicatory\\n    proceedings and appeals relating to the assessment of the civil\\n    penalties herein authorized. Such rules, which shall not be subject\\n    to the approval requirements of the state administrative procedure\\n    act, shall provide for due process procedural mechanisms\\n    substantially similar to those set forth in such article three but\\n    such mechanisms need not be identical in terms or scope. Assessment\\n    of a civil penalty shall be final unless modified, suspended or\\n    vacated within thirty days of imposition and upon becoming final\\n    shall be subject to review at the instance of the affected reporting\\n    individual in a proceeding commenced against the joint commission on\\n    public ethics or the legislative ethics commission, pursuant to\\n    article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules.\\n      5. Nothing contained in this section shall be construed as\\n    precluding any public authority or public benefit corporation from\\n    exercising any authority or power now or hereafter existing to\\n    require any of its members, directors, officers or employees to file\\n    financial disclosure statements with such public authority or public\\n    benefit corporation that are the same as, different from or\\n    supplemental to any of the requirements contained herein and to\\n    provide only for internal employment discipline for any violation\\n    arising out of such internal filing.\\n      6. Notwithstanding any other provision of law or any professional\\n    disciplinary rule to the contrary, the disclosure of the identity of\\n    any client or customer on a reporting individual's annual statement\\n    of financial disclosure shall not constitute professional misconduct\\n    or a ground for disciplinary action of any kind, or form the basis\\n    for any civil or criminal cause of action or proceeding.\\n      7. With respect to an application to either the joint commission\\n    or the office of court administration for an exemption to disclosing\\n    the name of a client or customer in response to questions 8 (b-1), 8\\n    (b-2) and 8 (c), all information which is the subject of or a part\\n    of such application shall remain confidential. The name of the\\n    client need not be disclosed by the reporting individual unless and\\n    until the joint commission or the office of court administration\\n    formally advises the reporting individual that he or she must\\n    disclose such names and the reporting individual agrees to represent\\n    the client. Any commissioner or person employed by the joint\\n    commission or any person employed by the office of court\\n    administration who, intentionally and without authorization from a\\n    court of competent jurisdiction releases confidential information\\n    related to a request for an exemption received by the commission or\\n    the office of court administration shall be guilty of a class A\\n    misdemeanor.\\n",

The\\nmembers of the committee shall be entitled to reimbursement for actual\\nexpenses incurred in the discharge of their duties.\\n  (b) The committee shall:\\n  i. furnish to any agency advisory guidelines, opinions or other\\nappropriate information regarding this article;\\n  ii. furnish to any person advisory opinions or other appropriate\\ninformation regarding this article;\\n  iii. promulgate rules and regulations with respect to the\\nimplementation of subdivision one and paragraph (c) of subdivision three\\nof section eighty-seven of this article;\\n  iv. request from any agency such assistance, services and information\\nas will enable the committee to effectively carry out its powers and\\nduties;\\n  v. develop a form, which shall be made available on the internet, that\\nmay be used by the public to request a record; and\\n  vi. report on its activities and findings regarding this article and\\narticle seven of this chapter, including recommendations for changes in\\nthe law, to the governor and the legislature annually, on or before\\nDecember fifteenth.\\n  2. (a) The committee on public access to records may promulgate\\nguidelines regarding deletion of identifying details or withholding of\\nrecords otherwise available under this article to prevent unwarranted\\ninvasions of personal privacy. In the absence of such guidelines, an\\nagency may delete identifying details when it makes records available.\\n  (b) An unwarranted invasion of personal privacy includes, but shall\\nnot be limited to:\\n  i. disclosure of employment, medical or credit histories or personal\\nreferences of applicants for employment;\\n  ii. disclosure of items involving the medical or personal records of a\\nclient or patient in a medical facility;\\n  iii. sale or release of lists of names and addresses if such lists\\nwould be used for solicitation or fund-raising purposes;\\n  iv. disclosure of information of a personal nature when disclosure\\nwould result in economic or personal hardship to the subject party and\\nsuch information is not relevant to the work of the agency requesting or\\nmaintaining it;\\n  v. disclosure of information of a personal nature reported in\\nconfidence to an agency and not relevant to the ordinary work of such\\nagency;\\n  vi. information of a personal nature contained in a workers'\\ncompensation record, except as provided by section one hundred ten-a of\\nthe workers' compensation law;\\n  vii. disclosure of electronic contact information, such as an e-mail\\naddress or a social network username, that has been collected from a\\ntaxpayer under section one hundred four of the real property tax law; or\\n  viii. disclosure of law enforcement arrest or booking photographs of\\nan individual, unless public release of such photographs will serve a\\nspecific law enforcement purpose and disclosure is not precluded by any\\nstate or federal laws.\\n  (c) Unless otherwise provided by this article, disclosure shall not be\\nconstrued to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy\\npursuant to paragraphs (a) and (b) of this subdivision:\\n  i. when identifying details are deleted;\\n  ii. when the person to whom a record pertains consents in writing to\\ndisclosure;\\n  iii. when upon presenting reasonable proof of identity, a person seeks\\naccess to records pertaining to him or her; or\\n  iv. when a record or group of records relates to the right, title or\\ninterest in real property, or relates to the inventory, status or\\ncharacteristics of real property, in which case disclosure and providing\\ncopies of such record or group of records shall not be deemed an\\nunwarranted invasion of personal privacy, provided that nothing herein\\nshall be construed to authorize the disclosure of electronic contact\\ninformation, such as an e-mail address or a social network username,\\nthat has been collected from a taxpayer under section one hundred four\\nof the real property tax law.\\n  2-a. Nothing in this article shall permit disclosure which constitutes\\nan unwarranted invasion of personal privacy as defined in subdivision\\ntwo of this section if such disclosure is prohibited under section\\nninety-six of this chapter.\\n  3. (a) Each entity subject to the provisions of this article, within\\nfive business days of the receipt of a written request for a record\\nreasonably described, shall make such record available to the person\\nrequesting it, deny such request in writing or furnish a written\\nacknowledgement of the receipt of such request and a statement of the\\napproximate date, which shall be reasonable under the circumstances of\\nthe request, when such request will be granted or denied, including,\\nwhere appropriate, a statement that access to the record will be\\ndetermined in accordance with subdivision five of this section. An\\nagency shall not deny a request on the basis that the request is\\nvoluminous or that locating or reviewing the requested records or\\nproviding the requested copies is burdensome because the agency lacks\\nsufficient staffing or on any other basis if the agency may engage an\\noutside professional service to provide copying, programming or other\\nservices required to provide the copy, the costs of which the agency may\\nrecover pursuant to paragraph (c) of subdivision one of section\\neighty-seven of this article. An agency may require a person requesting\\nlists of names and addresses to provide a written certification that\\nsuch person will not use such lists of names and addresses for\\nsolicitation or fund-raising purposes and will not sell, give or\\notherwise make available such lists of names and addresses to any other\\nperson for the purpose of allowing that person to use such lists of\\nnames and addresses for solicitation or fund-raising purposes. If an\\nagency determines to grant a request in whole or in part, and if\\ncircumstances prevent disclosure to the person requesting the record or\\nrecords within twenty business days from the date of the acknowledgement\\nof the receipt of the request, the agency shall state, in writing, both\\nthe reason for the inability to grant the request within twenty business\\ndays and a date certain within a reasonable period, depending on the\\ncircumstances, when the request will be granted in whole or in part.\\nUpon payment of, or offer to pay, the fee prescribed therefor, the\\nentity shall provide a copy of such record and certify to the\\ncorrectness of such copy if so requested, or as the case may be, shall\\ncertify that it does not have possession of such record or that such\\nrecord cannot be found after diligent search. Nothing in this article\\nshall be construed to require any entity to prepare any record not\\npossessed or maintained by such entity except the records specified in\\nsubdivision three of section eighty-seven and subdivision three of\\nsection eighty-eight of this article. When an agency has the ability to\\nretrieve or extract a record or data maintained in a computer storage\\nsystem with reasonable effort, it shall be required to do so. When doing\\nso requires less employee time than engaging in manual retrieval or\\nredactions from non-electronic records, the agency shall be required to\\nretrieve or extract such record or data electronically. Any programming\\nnecessary to retrieve a record maintained in a computer storage system\\nand to transfer that record to the medium requested by a person or to\\nallow the transferred record to be read or printed shall not be deemed\\nto be the preparation or creation of a new record.\\n  (b) All entities shall, provided such entity has reasonable means\\navailable, accept requests for records submitted in the form of\\nelectronic mail and shall respond to such requests by electronic mail,\\nusing forms, to the extent practicable, consistent with the form or\\nforms developed by the committee on open government pursuant to\\nsubdivision one of this section and provided that the written requests\\ndo not seek a response in some other form.\\n  (c) Each state agency, as defined in subdivision five of this section,\\nthat maintains a website shall ensure its website provides for the\\nonline submission of a request for records pursuant to this article.\\n  4. (a) Except as provided in subdivision five of this section, any\\nperson denied access to a record may within thirty days appeal in\\nwriting such denial to the head, chief executive or governing body of\\nthe entity, or the person therefor designated by such head, chief\\nexecutive, or governing body, who shall within ten business days of the\\nreceipt of such appeal fully explain in writing to the person requesting\\nthe record the reasons for further denial, or provide access to the\\nrecord sought. In addition, each agency shall immediately forward to the\\ncommittee on open government a copy of such appeal when received by the\\nagency and the ensuing determination thereon. Failure by an agency to\\nconform to the provisions of subdivision three of this section shall\\nconstitute a denial.\\n  (b) Except as provided in subdivision five of this section, a person\\ndenied access to a record in an appeal determination under the\\nprovisions of paragraph (a) of this subdivision may bring a proceeding\\nfor review of such denial pursuant to article seventy-eight of the civil\\npractice law and rules. In the event that access to any record is denied\\npursuant to the provisions of subdivision two of section eighty-seven of\\nthis article, the agency involved shall have the burden of proving that\\nsuch record falls within the provisions of such subdivision two. Failure\\nby an agency to conform to the provisions of paragraph (a) of this\\nsubdivision shall constitute a denial.\\n  (c) The court in such a proceeding: (i) may assess, against such\\nagency involved, reasonable attorney's fees and other litigation costs\\nreasonably incurred by such person in any case under the provisions of\\nthis section in which such person has substantially prevailed, and when\\nthe agency failed to respond to a request or appeal within the statutory\\ntime; and (ii) shall assess, against such agency involved, reasonable\\nattorney's fees and other litigation costs reasonably incurred by such\\nperson in any case under the provisions of this section in which such\\nperson has substantially prevailed and the court finds that the agency\\nhad no reasonable basis for denying access.\\n  (d) (i) Appeal to the appellate division of the supreme court must be\\nmade in accordance with subdivision (a) of section fifty-five hundred\\nthirteen of the civil practice law and rules.\\n  (ii) An appeal from an agency taken from an order of the court\\nrequiring disclosure of any or all records sought:\\n  (A) shall be given preference;\\n  (B) shall be brought on for argument on such terms and conditions as\\nthe presiding justice may direct, upon application of any party to the\\nproceeding; and\\n  (C) shall be deemed abandoned if the agency fails to serve and file a\\nrecord and brief within sixty days after the date of service upon the\\npetitioner of the notice of appeal, unless consent to further extension\\nis given by all parties, or unless further extension is granted by the\\ncourt upon such terms as may be just and upon good cause shown.\\n  5.
