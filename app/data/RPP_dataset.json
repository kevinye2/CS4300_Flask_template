A good faith complaint, by or in behalf of the tenant, to the\\nlandlord, the landlord's agent or a governmental authority of the\\nlandlord's alleged violation of any health or safety law, regulation,\\ncode, or ordinance, the warranty of habitability under section two\\nhundred thirty-five-b of this article, the duty to repair under sections\\nseventy-eight, seventy-nine, and eighty of the multiple dwelling law or\\nsection one hundred seventy-four of the multiple residence law, or any\\nlaw or regulation which has as its objective the regulation of premises\\nused for dwelling purposes or which pertains to the offense of rent\\ngouging in the third, second or first degree; or\\n  b.

No landlord of premises or units to which this section is\\napplicable or such landlord's agent shall substantially alter the terms\\nof the tenancy in retaliation for any actions set forth in paragraphs a,\\nb, and c of subdivision one of this section. Substantial alteration\\nshall include, but is not limited to, the refusal to continue a tenancy\\nof the tenant, upon expiration of the tenant's lease, to renew the lease\\nor offer a new lease, or offering a new lease with an unreasonable rent\\nincrease; provided, however, that a landlord shall not be required under\\nthis section to offer a new lease or a lease renewal for a term greater\\nthan one year.\\n  3. A landlord shall be subject to a civil action for damages,\\nattorney's fees and costs and other appropriate relief, including\\ninjunctive and other equitable remedies, as may be determined by a court\\nof competent jurisdiction in any case in which the landlord has violated\\nthe provisions of this section.\\n  4. In any action to recover real property or summary proceeding to\\nrecover possession of real property, judgment shall be entered for the\\ntenant if the court finds that the landlord is acting in retaliation for\\nany action set forth in paragraphs a, b, and c of subdivision one of\\nthis section. Retaliation shall be asserted as an affirmative defense in\\nsuch action or proceeding. The tenant shall not be relieved of the\\nobligation to pay any rent for which he is otherwise liable.\\n  5. In an action or proceeding instituted against a tenant of premises\\nor a unit to which this section is applicable, a rebuttable presumption\\nthat the landlord is acting in retaliation shall be created if the\\ntenant establishes that the landlord served a notice to quit, or\\ninstituted an action or proceeding to recover possession, or attempted\\nto substantially alter the terms of the tenancy, within one year after:\\n  a.

Judgment under subdivision three or four of this section was\\nentered for the tenant in a previous action between the parties; or an\\ninspection was made, an order was entered, or other action was taken as\\na result of a complaint or act described in paragraph a or b of this\\nsubdivision.\\n  The effect of the presumption shall be to require the landlord to\\nestablish a non-retaliatory motive for his acts by a preponderance of\\nthe evidence.\\n  5-a. Any lease provision which seeks to assess a fee, penalty or\\ndollar charge, in addition to the stated rent, against a tenant because\\nsuch tenant files a bona fide complaint with the landlord, the\\nlandlord's agent or a building code officer regarding the condition of\\nsuch tenant's leased premises shall be null and void as being against\\npublic policy.

Increases in rent shall not exceed a three percent increase above\\nthe rent since the current rent became effective. In this section, rent\\nshall mean all costs, including all rent, fees, charges, assessments,\\nand utilities. Notwithstanding the above, a manufactured home park owner\\nis permitted to increase the rent in excess of three percent above the\\nrent since the current rent became effective, due to:\\n  (a) Increases in the manufactured home park owner's operating\\nexpenses.\\n  (b) Increases in the manufactured home park owner's property taxes on\\nsuch park.\\n  (c) Increases in costs which are directly related to capital\\nimprovements in the park.\\n  3. An increase above three percent may be challenged by an aggrieved\\nmanufactured homeowner as unjustified. Multiple aggrieved manufactured\\nhomeowners may join in the same action where there is a common question\\nof law and fact.\\n  4. Within ninety days of the proposed increase, an aggrieved\\nmanufactured homeowner may challenge such increase by filing an action\\nin the court of appropriate subject matter jurisdiction where the real\\nproperty is located seeking a declaratory judgment that the rent\\nincrease is unjustifiable.\\n  5. In any proceeding under this section there shall be an irrebuttable\\npresumption that a rent increase is justifiable when the amount of such\\nincrease does not exceed the tenant's pro-rata share in operating costs\\nand property taxes for the manufactured home park in which the\\nmanufactured home owner resides.\\n  6. (a) In determining whether a rent increase is permissible, the\\ncourt shall consider the provisions of paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of\\nsubdivision two of this section. Notwithstanding the above, rent\\nincreases shall not exceed six percent above the rent since the current\\nrent became effective, except upon the approval of a temporary hardship\\napplication by the court. In addition to the provisions of this\\nparagraph and paragraphs (b) and (c) of this subdivision the court shall\\ntake into account the following factors when determining whether to\\ngrant a temporary hardship application:\\n  (i) The amount of increase being sought by the park owners;\\n  (ii) The ability of the manufactured home owner to pay such increase\\nincluding whether the increase would have an unreasonable adverse impact\\non the manufactured home owner;\\n  (iii) The amount of time and notice the manufactured home owner may\\nneed in order to pay a temporary rent increase;\\n  (iv) The duration the park owners intend for the temporary rent\\nincrease to last;\\n  (v) The cause of the hardship the rent increase is being requested to\\nalleviate, including whether the hardship was due to owner negligence\\nand malfeasance;\\n  (vi) The ability of the park owners to utilize other means besides a\\nrent increase to alleviate said hardship;\\n  (vii) The likelihood that the property the manufactured home park is\\nlocated on will go into foreclosure if a temporary rent increase above\\nsix percent is not granted;\\n  (viii) Any other factor that will jeopardize the ability of the park\\nto legally operate.\\n  (b) A court order approving a temporary hardship application shall\\nstate for each manufactured home owner:\\n  (i) The amount of the rent increase;\\n  (ii) The date the rent increase is to take effect;\\n  (iii) The date the increase is to end;\\n  (iv) The amount the rent will return to; and\\n  (v) The court's findings as to the factors necessitating a temporary\\nincrease.\\n  (c) Upon a finding by the court that the manufactured home park should\\nbe granted a hardship exemption, the amount of any rent increase shall\\nbe the minimum amount to alleviate the hardship. An order granting a\\ntemporary rent increase shall not exceed six months. The order must be\\nserved on the manufactured home owners and all known legal tenants\\npursuant to the rules of civil procedure within thirty days of the court\\norder, the cost of which shall be on the manufactured home park owner.\\n  7. The court may condition its approval of any rent increase upon the\\nredress of conditions in the manufactured home park which threaten the\\nhealth and safety of the manufactured home tenant.\\n  8. While a challenge to a rent increase pursuant to this section is\\npending, manufactured home park tenants shall pay the amount of the rent\\nincrease to the manufactured home park owner who shall hold such amounts\\nin escrow pending a mediated agreement between the parties or a final\\ndecision from the courts, provided, however, that no manufactured home\\npark tenant shall be evicted for non-payment of the rent increase prior\\nto the final disposition of the matter by the court in the county where\\nthe manufactured home park is located.

Such request shall be\\naccompanied by the written consent thereto of any co-tenant or guarantor\\nof such lease and a statement of the name, business and home addresses\\nof the proposed assignee or sublessee. Within ten days after the mailing\\nof such request, the landlord may ask the sender thereof for additional\\ninformation as will enable the landlord to determine if rejection of\\nsuch request shall be unreasonable. Within thirty days after the mailing\\nof the request for consent, or of the additional information reasonably\\nasked for by the landlord, whichever is later, the landlord shall send a\\nnotice to the sender thereof of his election to terminate said lease or\\nto grant or refuse his consent.

If the landlord reasonably\\nrefuses his consent, said lease shall continue in full force and effect,\\nsubject to the right to make further requests for consent hereunder. Any\\nrequest, notice or communication required or authorized to be given\\nhereunder shall be sent by registered or certified mail, return receipt\\nrequested.

And if default shall be made in the payment\\nof the principal sum or the interest that may grow due thereon, or of\\nany part thereof, or in case of any other default, that then and from\\nthenceforth it shall be lawful for the mortgagee, his executors,\\nadministrators or successors to enter into and upon all and singular the\\npremises granted, or intended so to be, and to sell and dispose of the\\nsame, and all benefit and equity of redemption of the said mortgagor,\\nhis heirs, executors, administrators, successors or assigns therein, at\\npublic auction, according to the act in such case made and provided, and\\nas the attorney of the mortgagor for that purpose duly authorized,\\nconstituted and appointed, to make and deliver to the purchaser or\\npurchasers thereof a good and sufficient deed or deeds of conveyance for\\nthe same in fee simple (or otherwise; as the case may be) and out of the\\nmoney arising from such sale, to retain the principal and interest which\\nshall then be due, together with the costs and charges of advertisement\\nand sale of the said premises, rendering the overplus of the\\npurchase-money, if any there shall be, unto the mortgagor, his heirs,\\nexecutors, administrators, successors or assigns, which sale so to be\\nmade shall forever be a perpetual bar both in law and equity against the\\nmortgagor, his heirs, successors and assigns, and against all other\\npersons claiming or to claim the premises, or any part thereof by, from\\nor under him, them or any of them.\\n  4. Mortgagor to keep buildings insured. (a) A covenant \"that the\\nmortgagor will keep the buildings on the premises insured against loss\\nby fire for the benefit of the mortgagee; that he will assign and\\ndeliver the policies to the mortgagee; and that he will reimburse the\\nmortgagee for any premiums paid for insurance made by the mortgagee on\\nthe mortgagor's default in so insuring the buildings or in so assigning\\nand delivering the policies,\" shall be construed as meaning that the\\nmortgagor, his heirs, successors and assigns will, during all the time\\nuntil the money secured by the mortgage shall be fully paid and\\nsatisfied, keep the buildings erected on the premises insured against\\nloss or damage by fire, to an amount to be approved by the mortgagee not\\nexceeding in the aggregate one hundred per centum of their full\\ninsurable value and in a company or companies to be approved by the\\nmortgagee, and will assign and deliver the policy or policies of such\\ninsurance to the mortgagee, his executors, administrators, successors or\\nassigns, which policy or policies shall have endorsed thereon the\\nstandard New York mortgagee clause in the name of the mortgagee, so and\\nin such manner and form that he and they shall at all time and times,\\nuntil the full payment of said moneys, have and hold the said policy or\\npolicies as a collateral and further security for the payment of said\\nmoneys, and in default of so doing, that the mortgagee or his executors,\\nadministrators, successors or assigns, may make such insurance from year\\nto year, in an amount in the aggregate not exceeding one hundred per\\ncentum of the full insurable value of said buildings erected on the\\nmortgaged premises for the purposes aforesaid, and pay the premium or\\npremiums therefor, and that the mortgagor will pay to the mortgagee, his\\nexecutors, administrators, successors or assigns, such premium or\\npremiums so paid, with interest from the time of payment, on demand, and\\nthat the same shall be deemed to be secured by the mortgage, and shall\\nbe collectible thereupon and thereby in like manner as the principal\\nmoneys, and that should the mortgagee by reason of such insurance\\nagainst loss by fire receive any sum or sums of money for damage by\\nfire, and should the mortgagee retain such insurance money instead of\\npaying it over to the mortgagor, the mortgagee's right to retain the\\nsame and his duty to apply it in payment of or on account of the sum\\nsecured by the mortgage and in satisfaction or reduction of the lien\\nthereof shall be limited and qualified as hereafter in this paragraph\\nprovided. Said insurance money so received by the mortgagee shall be\\nheld by him as trust funds until paid over or applied as hereinafter\\nprovided. If the mortgagor shall notify the mortgagee in writing within\\nthirty days after the fire that the mortgaged premises have been damaged\\nthereby, and shall thereafter make good the damage by means of such\\nrepairs, restoration or rebuilding as may be necessary to restore the\\nbuildings to their condition prior to the damage, then upon presentation\\nto the mortgagee within three years after the fire of proof that the\\ndamage has been fully made good (and if he so demands in writing within\\nthirty days after such presentation of proof, then upon presentation to\\nthe mortgagee within thirty days after such demand of proof also of the\\nactual cost of such repairs, restoration and rebuilding and of the\\nreasonable value of any part of the work so performed by the mortgagor)\\nthe mortgagee, unless he rejects the proof submitted to him as\\ninsufficient, shall pay over to the mortgagor so much of said insurance\\nmoney theretofore received by the mortgagee as does not exceed the\\nlesser of (1) the reasonable cost of such repairs, restoration and\\nrebuilding or (2) the total amount actually paid therefor by the\\nmortgagor, together with the reasonable value of any part of the work\\ndone by him. Such proof shall be deemed sufficient unless, within sixty\\ndays after presentation of all such proof to the mortgagee as aforesaid,\\nhe shall notify the mortgagor in writing that the proof is rejected. Any\\nexcess of said insurance money over the amount so payable to the\\nmortgagor shall be applied in reduction of the principal of the\\nmortgage. Provided, however, that if and so long as there exists any\\ndefault by the mortgagor in the performance of any of the terms or\\nprovisions of the mortgage on his part to be performed the mortgagee\\nshall not be obligated to pay over any of said insurance money received\\nby him. If the mortgagor shall fail to comply with any of the foregoing\\nprovisions within the time or times hereinabove limited, or shall fail\\nwithin sixty days after rejection of the proof so submitted to commence\\nan action against the mortgagee to recover so much of said insurance\\nmoney as is payable to the mortgagor as hereinabove provided, or if the\\nentire principal of the mortgage shall have become payable by reason of\\ndefault or maturity, the mortgagee shall apply said insurance money in\\nsatisfaction or reduction of the principal of the mortgage; and any\\nexcess of said insurance money over the amount required to satisfy the\\nmortgage shall be paid to the mortgagor. Unless the court, in any such\\naction, shall determine that the mortgagee's rejection of the proof\\nsubmitted by the mortgagor prior to the commencement of the action was\\nunreasonable, the mortgagee may offset the reasonable amount, as\\ndetermined by the court, of his expense incident to the litigation, and\\nmay reimburse himself out of the insurance money for the amount so\\ndetermined.

In the event that\\nthere be more than one mortgage covering the same premises, such\\ncovenant must be construed as hereinbefore prescribed in this paragraph\\nexcept that the mortgagor, his heirs, successors and assigns,\\nnotwithstanding such foregoing provisions, may not be required to\\nprovide such insurance, as to all the mortgagees combined, in the\\npreferential order of their priority, for a total amount greater than\\nthe outstanding principal balance of the money secured by the mortgage\\nor the maximum limit of coverage available with respect to the premises,\\nwhichever is less, and a second or subordinate mortgagee shall be\\nentitled to exercise the rights of a mortgagee with respect to the\\nprocurement of such insurance and the holding of the policy or policies\\nthereof as hereinbefore prescribed in this paragraph only when and to\\nthe extent that the mortgagor, his heirs, successors or assigns, as the\\ncase may be, does or do not furnish satisfactory proof of such maximum\\ninsurance for the benefit of such second or subordinate mortgagee and\\none or more other mortgagees in the preferential order of their priority\\nin a company or companies duly authorized to do business in this state.\\n  The limitations and qualifications hereinabove imposed on the\\nmortgagee's right to retain proceeds of a flood insurance policy shall\\napply only to mortgages or extensions or other modifications thereof\\nmade after the effective date of this act.\\n  4-a.

(a) The legislature finds\\nand declares that homeowners who are in default on their mortgages or in\\nforeclosure may be vulnerable to fraud, deception, and unfair dealing by\\nhome equity purchasers. The recent rapid escalation of home values\\nthroughout urban and rural areas has resulted in a significant increase\\nin home equity, which constitutes the greatest financial asset held by\\nmany homeowners of this state. During the time period between the\\ndefault on the mortgage and the scheduled foreclosure sale date,\\nhomeowners in financial distress, especially poor, elderly, and\\nfinancially unsophisticated homeowners, are vulnerable to aggressive\\n\"equity purchasers\" who induce homeowners to sell their homes for a\\nsmall fraction of their fair market values, or in some cases even sign\\naway their homes, through the use of schemes which often involve oral\\nand written misrepresentations, deceit, intimidation, and other\\nunreasonable commercial practices.\\n  (b) The legislature declares that it is the express policy of the\\nstate to preserve and guard the precious asset of home equity, and the\\nsocial as well as the economic value of homeownership.\\n  (c) The legislature further finds that equity purchasers may have a\\nsignificant impact upon the economy and well-being of this state and its\\nlocal communities, and therefore the provisions of this section are\\nnecessary to promote the public welfare.\\n  (d) The intent and purposes of this section are to provide a homeowner\\nwith information necessary to make an informed and intelligent decision\\nregarding the sale or transfer of his or her home to an equity\\npurchaser; to require that the sales agreement be expressed in writing;\\nto safeguard equity sellers against deceit and financial hardship; to\\nensure, foster and encourage fair dealing in the sale and purchase of\\nhomes in foreclosure or default; to prohibit representations that tend\\nto mislead; to prohibit or restrict unfair contract terms; to provide a\\ncooling off period for equity sellers who enter into covered contracts;\\nto afford equity sellers a reasonable and meaningful opportunity to\\nrescind sales to equity purchasers; and to preserve and protect home\\nequity for the homeowners of this state.\\n  2.

A court\\nmay award to a prevailing equity seller actual damages plus reasonable\\nattorneys' fees and costs. In addition, the court may award equitable\\nrelief, or increase the award in an amount not to exceed three times the\\nequity seller's actual damages, or both, if the court deems such award\\nproper. Any action brought pursuant to this section shall be commenced\\nwithin six years after the date of the alleged violation.\\n  10.

Examples of bona fide errors include, but are not\\nlimited to, clerical, calculation, computer malfunction and programming,\\nand printing errors.  An error of legal judgment with respect to a\\nperson's obligations under this section is not a bona fide error, nor is\\na failure to provide notices or other material information required by\\nthis section.\\n  11. (a) In any transaction in which an equity seller purports to grant\\na residence in foreclosure or default to an equity purchaser by any\\ninstrument which appears to be an absolute conveyance and reserves to\\nhimself or herself or is given by the equity purchaser an option to\\nrepurchase, such transaction shall create a presumption that the\\ntransaction is a loan transaction, which may be overcome by clear and\\nconvincing evidence to the contrary, and that the purported absolute\\nconveyance is a mortgage.\\n  (b) An equity purchaser shall not enter into a reconveyance\\narrangement unless:\\n  (i) The equity purchaser verifies by appropriate documentation that\\nthe equity seller has or is likely to have a reasonable ability to pay\\nfor the subsequent conveyance of an interest back to the equity seller.\\nIn the case of a lease with an option to purchase, payment ability also\\nincludes the reasonable ability to purchase the property within the term\\nof the option to purchase. There is a rebuttable presumption that the\\nequity purchaser has not verified reasonable payment ability if the\\nequity purchaser has not obtained documents other than a statement by\\nthe equity seller of assets, liabilities and income. The standard for\\ndetermining a reasonable ability to pay shall be the same standard as\\nset forth in paragraph (k) of subdivision two of section six-l of the\\nbanking law;\\n  (ii) the equity purchaser and the equity seller complete a closing for\\nany reconveyance arrangement in which the equity purchaser obtains a\\ndeed or mortgage from an equity seller.

The equity purchaser shall make a\\ndetailed accounting of the basis for the payment amount, or a detailed\\naccounting of the reasons for failure to make a payment, including\\nproviding written documentation of expenses, within such one hundred\\ntwenty-day period. The accounting shall be on a form prescribed by the\\ndepartment of financial services. For purposes of this subparagraph, the\\nfollowing applies:\\n  (A) there is a rebuttable presumption that an appraisal by a person\\nlicensed or certified by an agency of the federal government or this\\nstate to appraise real estate establishes the fair market value of the\\nproperty;\\n  (B) the time for determining the fair market value amount shall be\\ndetermined in the reconveyance arrangement as either at the time of the\\nexecution of the reconveyance arrangement or at resale to a bona fide\\npurchaser. If the covered contract states that the fair market value\\nshall be determined at the time of resale, the fair market value shall\\nbe the resale price if it is sold within one hundred twenty days of the\\neviction or voluntary relinquishment of the property by the equity\\nseller. If the covered contract states that the fair market value shall\\nbe determined at the time of resale, and the resale is not completed\\nwithin one hundred twenty days of the eviction or voluntary\\nrelinquishment of the property by the equity seller, the fair market\\nvalue shall be determined by an appraisal conducted within ten days\\nafter the end of such one hundred twenty-day period and payment, if\\nrequired, shall be made to the equity seller. If payment is not made to\\nthe equity seller at such time, the fair market value shall be\\nrecalculated as the resale price on resale and payment shall be made to\\nthe equity seller within fifteen days of resale. A detailed accounting\\nof the basis for the payment amount shall be made within fifteen days of\\nresale, including providing written documentation of expenses. The\\naccounting shall be on a form prescribed by the department of financial\\nservices;\\n  (C) \"consideration\" shall mean any payment or thing of value provided\\nto the equity seller, including unpaid lease payments owed by the equity\\nseller prior to the date of eviction or voluntary relinquishment of the\\nproperty, reasonable costs paid to third parties necessary to complete\\nthe reconveyance transaction, payment of money to satisfy a debt or\\nlegal obligation of the equity seller or the reasonable cost of repairs\\nfor damage to the dwelling caused by the equity seller beyond ordinary\\nwear and tear; but shall not include amounts imputed as any fee paid\\ndirectly or indirectly to the equity purchaser, or his or her\\nrepresentative, incident to a reconveyance arrangement, except for\\nreasonable costs paid to third parties necessary to complete the\\nreconveyance.\\n  (D) \"resale\" means a bona fide market sale of the property subject to\\nthe reconveyance arrangement by the equity purchaser to an unaffiliated\\nthird party.\\n  (E) \"resale price\" means the purchase price of the property on resale.\\n  (e) This subdivision shall not be deemed to abrogate any duty of\\ninquiry which exists as to rights or interests of persons in possession\\nof the residential real property in foreclosure or default.\\n  (f) All deeds or conveyances subject to a reconveyance arrangement\\nshall state explicitly on the face of the document that the conveyance\\nis subject to a reconveyance arrangement, and shall state the terms of\\nthe reconveyance arrangement. Moreover, all reconveyance arrangements\\nmust be simultaneously recorded by the equity purchaser with the subject\\ndeed in the county clerk's office where the property is located.\\n  12. Any provision of a covered contract which attempts or purports to\\nlimit the liability of the equity purchaser under this section shall be\\nnull and void. Inclusion of such provision shall at the option of the\\nequity seller render the covered contract void. The equity purchaser\\nshall be liable to the equity seller for all damages proximately caused\\nby such provision. Any provision in a covered contract which attempts or\\npurports to require arbitration of any dispute arising under this\\nsection shall be void at the option of the equity seller.\\n  13. In addition to the other remedies provided, whenever there shall\\nbe a violation of this section, application may be made by the attorney\\ngeneral in the name of the people of the state of New York to a court or\\njustice having jurisdiction by a special proceeding to issue an\\ninjunction, and upon notice to the defendant of not less than five days,\\nto enjoin and restrain the continuance of such violations; and if it\\nshall appear to the satisfaction of the court or justice that the\\ndefendant has, in fact, violated this section, an injunction may be\\nissued by such court or justice, enjoining and restraining any further\\nviolation, without requiring proof that any person has, in fact, been\\ninjured or damaged thereby. In any such proceeding, the court may make\\nallowances to the attorney general as provided in paragraph six of\\nsubdivision (a) of section eighty-three hundred three of the civil\\npractice law and rules, and direct restitution. Whenever the court shall\\ndetermine that a violation of this section has occurred, the court may\\nimpose a civil penalty of not more than twenty-five thousand dollars for\\neach violation. In connection with any such proposed application, the\\nattorney general is authorized to take proof and make a determination of\\nthe relevant facts and to issue subpoenas in accordance with the civil\\npractice law and rules.\\n  14. This section shall not apply to a prior lien holder where the lien\\nwas properly recorded prior to the execution of any covered contract by\\nboth the equity seller and the equity purchaser nor shall any provision\\nof this section be deemed to impair any equity or other available rights\\nof any such prior lien holder.\\n  15. The provisions of this section shall be liberally construed to\\neffectuate the intent and to achieve the purposes set forth in\\nsubdivision one of this section.\\n  16. The provisions of this section are not exclusive and are in\\naddition to any other requirements, rights, remedies, and penalties\\nprovided by law.\\n  17. Any waiver of the provisions of this section shall be void and\\nunenforceable as contrary to the public policy.\\n  18. If any provision of this section, or if any application thereof to\\nany person or circumstances is held unconstitutional, the remainder of\\nthis section and the application of its provisions to other persons and\\ncircumstances shall not be affected thereby.\\n",

              "text" : "  § 321. Recording discharge of mortgage. 1. The recording officer shall\\nmark on the record of a mortgage the word \"discharged\" when there is\\npresented to him a certificate or certificates signed as hereinafter\\nprovided, and acknowledged or proved and certified in like manner as to\\nentitle a conveyance to be recorded, specifying that the mortgage has\\nbeen paid or otherwise satisfied and discharged.\\n  (a) When it does not appear from the record that any interest in the\\nmortgage has been assigned, the discharge shall be signed by the\\nmortgagee or by his personal representative.\\n  (b) When it appears from the record that the mortgage has been\\nassigned, whether or not the assignment was made as collateral security,\\nthe discharge shall be signed by the person who appears from the record\\nto be the last assignee thereof or by his personal representative.\\n  (c) When the mortgage or an assignment thereof names two or more\\npersons as mortgagees or assignees, the discharge shall be signed by the\\nperson or persons designated by the mortgage or assignment to receive\\npayment of the mortgage debt or to give full acquittance and discharge\\ntherefor.  When no such person or persons are designated by the mortgage\\nor assignment, the certificate of discharge shall be signed by all of\\nthe persons named, in the mortgage or assignment, as mortgagees or\\nassignees, as the case may be, or by their personal representatives, if\\nthe mortgage or assignment (i) specifies their respective interest in\\nterms of a sum of money, or in terms of a fraction or percentage, or\\n(ii) states that such persons shall share equally in, or shall have\\nequal shares in the mortgage, or (iii) describes such persons as tenants\\nin common of the mortgage. When it appears from the record that the\\nmortgage is held by trustees, the certificate of discharge shall be\\nsigned by a majority of such trustees or of the survivors of them or by\\nthe survivors or survivor of them, unless the instrument creating the\\ntrust provides otherwise. Except as required above, the discharge may be\\nsigned by any one of the persons named in the mortgage or assignment, as\\nmortgagees or assignees, as the case may be, or by the personal\\nrepresentative of the last survivor of them. If the mortgage or\\nassignment states that the persons named therein as mortgagees or\\nassignees shall hold the mortgage jointly, or describes such persons as\\njoint tenants or tenants by the entirety of the mortgage, or expressly\\ncreates a right of survivorship among them, the discharge may be signed\\nby any one of such persons or by the personal representative of the last\\nsurvivor of them notwithstanding that the mortgage or assignment\\nspecifies their respective interests in the mortgage or states that they\\nshall share equally or have equal shares therein.\\n  (d) When the mortgage has been partially assigned, the certificate of\\ndischarge shall be signed by all of the persons, or their personal\\nrepresentatives, who in the aggregate are the holders of all portions of\\nthe mortgage, including each partial assignee, and the assignor in case\\nany portion of the mortgage has not been assigned; provided, however,\\nthat if any partial assignment names two or more persons as assignees,\\nthe person or persons who may sign the certificate discharging such\\npartial interest shall be determined in accordance with the provisions\\nof paragraph (c) of this subdivision.\\n  (e) Whenever two or more persons are required to execute a certificate\\nof discharge as provided in this subdivision, there may be presented in\\nlieu of such certificate, separately executed certificates of discharge\\nas to the respective interests of each in the mortgage so that together\\nthe several certificates purport to discharge the entire mortgage.\\n  (f) In place of any of the persons specified in paragraphs (a), (b),\\n(c) or (d) of this subdivision, a certificate of discharge of the\\nmortgage or of any interest therein may be signed (i) by an agent who\\nhas been authorized by any such person to demand or receive payment or\\nto give a certificate of discharge of the mortgage by a power of\\nattorney, provided such power of attorney is of record in the office\\nwhere the mortgage is recorded, and no instrument of revocation has been\\nrecorded; or (ii) by any person in whom title to such mortgage or to\\nsuch interest, or authority to act on behalf of or in exercise of the\\nright or power of the holder of such mortgage or of such interest is\\nvested, in a fiduciary capacity, by virtue of an order or decree of a\\ncourt having jurisdiction thereof, including, but not limited to, the\\nguardian of a minor, the committee of an incompetent person, or the\\nconservator of a conservatee, whether domestic or foreign, and a\\nreceiver in bankruptcy or trustee in bankruptcy. A certificate executed\\nby any person specified in clause (ii) of this paragraph shall recite\\nthe name of the court and the venue of the proceedings in which his\\nappointment was made, or the order or decree vesting him with such title\\nor authority was entered.\\n  (g) If the mortgage is stated in the certificate of discharge to have\\nbeen taken by the alien property custodian under and pursuant to the\\ntrading with the enemy act adopted by the United States congress, and\\napproved October sixth, nineteen hundred sixteen, or any act amendatory\\nthereof, or supplemental thereto, such certificate may be executed by\\nsuch alien property custodian or such person as the president may\\nappoint to give full acquittance and discharge for money or property\\nbelonging to an enemy or ally of an enemy which may be conveyed,\\nassigned, delivered or transferred to said alien property custodian,\\nwith like effect as if the same had been executed by the mortgagee, his\\npersonal representative or assignee. Such certificate may be recorded,\\nand such certificate, the record thereof and a certified copy of such\\nrecord may be introduced in evidence in all courts of this state.\\n  2. (a) The recording officer shall record and file such certificate or\\ncertificates together with the certificates of acknowledgment or proof,\\nand shall note on the record of the mortgage the book and page\\ncontaining such record of such certificate or certificates or the serial\\nnumber of such record in the minute of the discharge of such mortgage,\\nmade by the officer upon the record thereof. The provisions of this\\nparagraph shall not apply to the county of Suffolk, if the block method\\nof index is in use, or a separate index of satisfactions recorded is\\nmaintained.\\n  (b) The recording officer shall also record every other instrument\\nrelating to a mortgage which is presented to him, acknowledged or proved\\nin like manner as to entitle a conveyance to be recorded, including\\ncertificates purporting to discharge a mortgage or an interest therein\\nwhich are signed by persons other than those specified in the first\\nsubdivision of this section, and also including, but not limited to,\\nassignments, releases, partial discharges, reductions, estoppel\\ncertificates, extensions, discharges of partial interest and partial\\ndischarges of partial interest, regardless by whom any such instrument\\nhas been executed. When any such instrument has been recorded, the\\nrecording officer, except in counties where the block method of indexing\\nis in use, or in Suffolk county, if a separate index of said instruments\\nis maintained, shall enter a minute upon the record of the mortgage to\\nwhich such instrument relates, indicating the nature of such instrument\\nand the book and page where it has been recorded or the serial number of\\nsuch record.\\n  3. Every certificate presented to the recording officer shall be\\nexecuted and acknowledged or proved in like manner as to entitle a\\nconveyance to be recorded. If the mortgage has been assigned, in whole\\nor in part, the certificate shall set forth the date of each assignment\\nin the chain of title of the person or persons signing the certificate,\\nthe names of the assignor and assignee, the interest assigned, and, if\\nthe assignment has been recorded, the book and page where it has been\\nrecorded or the serial number of such record; or if the assignment is\\nbeing recorded simultaneously with the certificate of discharge, the\\ncertificate of discharge shall so state. If the mortgage has not been\\nassigned of record, the certificate shall so state.\\n  No certificate presented to the recording officer shall purport to\\ndischarge more than one mortgage, except that one certificate may\\npurport to discharge two or more mortgages where the certificate states\\nthat one of such mortgages corrects, perfects or modifies the other\\nmortgage or mortgages, or spreads the lien of the other mortgage or\\nmortgages over the property subject to the lien of such mortgage, or\\nconsolidates the lien of the other mortgage or mortgages with the lien\\nof such mortgage to constitute a single lien, or where the certificate\\nstates that the liens of the mortgages which the certificate purports to\\ndischarge have been so spread or so consolidated by a separate\\ninstrument and such instrument has been recorded; provided that in such\\ncase the certificate of discharge shall identify and describe each\\nmortgage which it purports to discharge, in a separate paragraph, in the\\nsame manner and with the same particularity, and setting forth the same\\ninformation with respect to assignments thereof, as would be required\\nfor a separate certificate discharging that mortgage, and shall also\\nstate, in a separate paragraph for each instrument, the date of any such\\nseparate instrument by which the liens of the mortgages have been spread\\nor consolidated, the names of the parties thereto, and the book and page\\nwhere it has been recorded or the serial number of such record. In any\\nsuch case, except where otherwise expressly provided by law, the fee or\\nfees which the recording officer is entitled to receive for filing and\\nentering a certificate of discharge of a mortgage and examining\\nassignments of such mortgage shall be payable with respect to each\\nmortgage which the certificate purports to discharge, to the same extent\\nas if a separate certificate of discharge had been filed for such\\nmortgage.\\n  4. After the record of the mortgage has been marked with the word\\n\"discharged,\" the recording officer shall make and deliver to any person\\ntendering the lawful fees therefor, his certificate setting forth the\\nnames of the mortgagor and the mortgagee, the book and page at which,\\nthe date when such mortgage was recorded, and the date on which the\\nrecord of such mortgage was so marked, except in a county where\\nrecording is done by microphotography or photostating in the manner\\npermitted by law, in which case, after microphotography or photostating,\\nsuch certificate of discharge and the certificates of its acknowledgment\\nor proof shall, in lieu of filing as provided in paragraph (a) of\\nsubdivision two of this section, be returned to the party leaving same\\nfor record.\\n  5. The term \"personal representative\" as used in this section shall\\ninclude the following:\\n  (a) An executor, administrator or voluntary administrator or one of\\ntwo or more executors, administrators or voluntary administrators,\\nwhether domestic or foreign, including the public administrator, and an\\nancillary administrator appointed in this state. A certificate executed\\nby any such personal representative shall recite the name of the court\\nand the venue of the proceedings in which his letters testamentary or of\\nadministration were issued.\\n  (b) All of the distributees of a person dying intestate for whom no\\nadministrator shall have been appointed, provided that two years shall\\nhave elapsed since the date of death of such intestate. A certificate\\nexecuted by such distributees shall recite the date of death of the\\nintestate, his place of residence at the time of death, the fact that he\\ndied intestate, that no administrator has been appointed and that they\\nconstitute all the distributees of the intestate.\\n  6. The provisions of this section authorizing the recording officer to\\nmark on the record of a mortgage the word \"discharged\" shall not be\\ndeemed to enlarge, diminish or alter the legal effect which a\\ncertificate executed by any person or persons, or any payment made by\\nthe mortgagor or other transaction with respect to the mortgage or the\\nmortgage debt, would otherwise have upon the rights of the mortgagor or\\nof any person claiming a right or interest in the mortgage, the mortgage\\ndebt or the property subject to the mortgage.\\n  7. In a county in which recording is accomplished by microfilm process\\nand in which a block index of mortgages is also maintained it will not\\nbe necessary to mark the record of the mortgage \"discharged\", but it\\nwill be deemed sufficient compliance with this section if there is\\nentered upon the block index of such mortgage the date of filing and the\\nserial number of the certificate effecting the discharge.\\n  7-a. If in any county, recording is accomplished by microfilm process\\nand a separate index for satisfactions recorded is maintained or in\\nwhich a block index of mortgages is also maintained it will not be\\nnecessary to mark the record of the mortgage \"discharged\", but it will\\nbe deemed sufficient compliance with this section if there is entered\\nupon the index of such mortgage the date of filing and the serial number\\nof the certificate effecting the discharge.\\n  8. Certificates of discharge of mortgage and certificates of their\\nacknowledgment or proof heretofore or hereafter recorded and filed, may\\nbe returned personally or by mail to the party leaving same for record\\nor destroyed after microfilming or photostating where proper indices are\\nmaintained.\\n",

Every such map, whether intended as an original subdivision or as\\nan alteration of a prior subdivision in such county, shall have endorsed\\nthereon at the time such map is offered to be filed the certificates of\\nthe county treasurer and the receiver of taxes of each town and city and\\nthe tax collecting officer of each incorporated village within which any\\npart of the tract of land shown on said map or maps is located, or of a\\ntitle company authorized to transact business in the state of New York\\nstating that all taxes and assessments which are liens prior to the time\\nsuch original or subsequent map is offered to be filed, whether assessed\\nagainst the entire tract of land or against any lot or other part of\\nsaid land, shown on the tax search required to be filed with the county\\nclerk, have been paid.\\n  10. At the time of the filing of such map there shall also be\\nfurnished to the county clerk a copy of such map, prepared upon tracing\\ncloth by such process as he shall prescribe, which shall be duly\\ncertified by him to be a true copy of the original and which shall be\\nforwarded by him to the board of assessors of the county.\\n  11. The clerk of the county of Nassau upon receiving such maps shall\\nfile them by some suitable method in consecutive order and they shall be\\nconsecutively numbered in the order of filing and indexed under the\\ninitial letters of all substantives in the titles.\\n  12. The fee of the county clerk for receiving and filing each of said\\nseparate maps or sheets and indexing the same shall be five dollars, and\\nan additional fee for every block created, which fee shall be the same\\nas the additional fee provided for block indexing by the Nassau county\\nadministrative code.\\n  13. Failure to file said map or maps as required by the provisions of\\nthis section, shall subject the owner of such lands shown upon such\\nmaps, or of unsold lots, plots or units thereon, to a penalty to the\\npeople of the state of New York of five hundred dollars for each and\\nevery lot, plot or unit thereon subdivided, sold or conveyed by or for\\nsuch owner prior to the due filing of such map or maps.\\n  14. Whenever at least two years have elapsed since the filing of a map\\nof the subdivision of any tract of land into lots, plots, blocks or\\nsites, with or without opened or proposed roads, the owner of such\\ntract, or of any part thereof having an area equivalent to that of any\\ntwo or more contiguous lots or an area of not less than one-half acre,\\nmay abandon and cancel the subdivision of the property so owned by\\nrecording in the office of the county clerk a written certificate of\\nabandonment, duly executed and acknowledged, which shall contain a\\ndescription of the property to be abandoned, the complete title or name\\nof the map, the filing date and file number thereof, except that no\\nopened or proposed streets, other than those entirely within the bounds\\nof the property to be abandoned, or the area within such bounds of\\nstreets which as laid out on said map come to a dead-end within such\\nbounds, shall be abandoned unless each owner of a lot or interest in the\\nsubdivision consents to the abandonment thereof by instrument in writing\\nduly executed, acknowledged and recorded with the certificate of\\nabandonment; provided, however, that whenever at least twenty years have\\nelapsed since the filing of said map, the owner of the property to be\\nabandoned may, without such consent, abandon any streets or portions\\nthereof shown on said map and which are within the bounds of the\\nproperty to be abandoned if such streets or portions thereof are neither\\nopened, nor public highways, nor used by the public, nor necessary for\\nthe use of owners, occupants or any other persons having an interest in\\nany part of the subdivision; but nothing herein shall prevent an owner\\nusing or a seller of land from conveying part of a lot, plot or site\\nseparately or together with an adjoining lot, plot or site, subject to\\nthe provisions of local zoning ordinances. Whenever there is on file\\nmore than one map of the property to be abandoned, such property must be\\nabandoned in the manner herein provided as to each of such maps. A copy\\nof each certificate of abandonment must be filed with the assessor\\nand/or board of assessors of each town and village wherein any portion\\nof the property to be abandoned is situated, and the endorsement of\\napproval by each such assessor and/or board of assessors must be\\nendorsed on the original of each certificate presented to the county\\nclerk for recording. An abstract of title to the property to be\\nabandoned covering a period of at least twenty years last past, and a\\ncertificate of the county treasurer of Nassau county to the effect that\\nthere are no unpaid tax liens against such property, must be submitted\\nto the county clerk and be approved by him at the time the certificate\\nof abandonment and cancellation is offered for recording. Said\\ncertificates and abstracts shall be filed in the county clerk's office,\\na suitable index shall be kept of the same, and notice thereof shall be\\nendorsed by the recording officer upon the map therein referred to at\\nthe time of recording the certificate of abandonment. Where the\\nendorsement of approval of the town or village assessor above referred\\nto includes a recitation to the effect that the municipality has duly\\nadopted an urban renewal plan pursuant to article fifteen of the general\\nmunicipal law which plan provides for adequate street access to all\\nproperties within and adjacent to the planning area, and further that\\nthe property to be abandoned is subject to said plan, and its\\nabandonment is required thereunder, the clerk shall accept and record\\nthe certificate of abandonment tendered therefor regardless of the area\\nthereof, and notwithstanding that the property to be abandoned is a\\nportion of an opened or proposed street for which the consent to the\\nabandonment thereof required in this subdivision has not been obtained.\\nUpon the abandonment of subdivided property as herein provided such\\nproperty shall, for all purposes, be regarded as a single tract of land.\\nNo abandonment of lot divisions shall be made under this section for the\\npurpose of reviving or making effective any other subdivision of the\\nsame tract of land and no map may be reinstated as it was prior to the\\nfiling of any abandonment certificate. The fee of the county clerk for\\nsuch filing and indexing each certificate and abstract therewith shall\\nbe ten dollars and shall be paid by the party presenting them for\\nfiling. Provided, however, that the Nassau county board of supervisors\\nshall have full authority to abandon any subdivision of property or any\\nportion thereof which the county of Nassau now owns or may hereafter\\nacquire through the sale of tax liens, by causing to be filed with the\\ncounty clerk of Nassau county, a certificate of abandonment, duly\\nexecuted by the said county board, without regard to any of the other\\nforegoing requirements of this section. Nothing contained in this\\nsection shall be construed to prevent the filing of a new map and\\ncertificate of a subdivision of real property in the manner prescribed\\nherein, after, and in the area of, a subdivision or portion thereof\\nabandoned in accordance with the provisions of this section.\\n",

It shall be the duty of every person\\nor corporation, excepting church cemetery organizations, attached to a\\nreligious parish within the county of Suffolk, who as owner or agent\\nsubdivides real property in Suffolk county into lots, plots, blocks or\\nsites, with or without streets, for the purpose of offering such lots,\\nplots, blocks or sites for sale to the public, regardless of how they\\nare conveyed, to file or cause to be filed in the office of the county\\nclerk of Suffolk county a map thereof together with a certificate of the\\nsurveyor endorsed on the face of such map certifying same to have been\\nmade from an actual survey of the property that was performed by or\\nunder the direction of said surveyor and the date of the completion of\\nthe survey. Said certificate shall state that stone or concrete\\nmonuments have been set at not less than two corners of every street\\nintersection as indicated on such map, provided, however, that where the\\nplanning board or other governmental agency having jurisdiction over the\\napproval of said maps has required the subdivider to deposit with the\\ntown or local governing body a performance bond or bonds to secure the\\ninstallation and completion of all site improvements, including setting\\nstone or concrete monuments in the streets as aforesaid, and\\nsimultaneously with the filing of said map the subdivider files with the\\ncounty clerk a written certification from the town or local governing\\nbody that such bond or bonds have been duly deposited and accepted by\\nthe town or local governing body and that said bond or bonds expressly\\ninclude the setting of stone or concrete monuments as aforesaid, the\\nsaid surveyor's certificate may state that stone or concrete monuments\\nwill be set at not less than two corners of every street intersection as\\nindicated on such map upon completion of the installation of said\\nstreets and that the surveyor shall execute and deliver a further\\nwritten certification of the completion of such monumentation to both\\nthe county clerk and the town or local governing body prior to and as a\\ncondition for the release of said performance bond or bonds. All lots\\nand blocks on such map shall be numbered consecutively. Said map shall\\nset forth the courses, measurements and adjoining property owners with\\nsufficient definiteness to determine the location of said property and\\nthe name of the subdivision as stated by the owner. Said name must\\ndiffer from any name already filed with the county clerk and must be\\napproved by the county clerk before the acceptance of the map. At the\\ntime of the filing of such map there shall also be furnished to the\\ncounty clerk two copies of such map for each town and village in which\\nany portion of the mapped property is located. Such copies shall be duly\\ncertified by him to be true copies of the original and one certified\\ncopy shall be forwarded by said county clerk to the assessor or board of\\nassessors, as the case may be, of each town or village in which any\\nportion of said property is located. At the time of filing such map with\\nthe county clerk an abstract of title of all of the property shown on\\nsaid map which shall cover a period of not less than the twenty years\\nlast past the date it is submitted, certified by an attorney and\\ncounselor at law of the state of New York, a title company duly\\nincorporated and authorized to transact business in the state of New\\nYork or a competent searcher of titles, shall be presented to said\\ncounty clerk, and be filed in his office, unless the title to said\\nproperty has been duly registered pursuant to the provisions of the real\\nproperty law for the registration of titles to real property, in which\\ncase this fact shall be set forth upon the original map together with\\nthe number of the certificate of the title so registered. An index of\\nsuch abstracts and registrations shall be maintained to clearly indicate\\nthe maps to which they refer. In the case of a tax title, the fee title\\nfor a period of at least twenty years prior to the date of the tax sale\\nunder which title is claimed must be submitted as a part of the\\nabstract. A key map, made to the scale of six hundred feet to one inch,\\nmust appear on all maps submitted and must show one or more monuments in\\nthe tract definitely tied to a given point or a monument set at the\\npoint of the intersection of the side lines (as prolonged, if there is a\\ncurve) of two established highways; said point or monument shall be that\\nwhich is nearest the proposed subdivision and shall not require a\\nmeasurement to be made across any portion of an established highway. No\\nre-mapping of subdivided property will be accepted for filing until\\nthere has been filed with the county clerk a certificate of abandonment\\nand cancellation of the original map or the portion thereof to be\\nabandoned and cancelled in accordance with the provisions of this act.\\nBefore a map will be eligible for filing, a certificate of the county\\ntreasurer of Suffolk county or the report of a tax search by a licensed\\ntitle company must be submitted by the party presenting the map for\\nfiling as a part of the abstract of title showing the payment in full of\\nall taxes due and payable at the date of filing. Such maps and abstracts\\nof title shall be filed as aforesaid and a copy of said map filed in the\\noffice of the clerk of each town or village where any portion of said\\nproperty is located prior to the offering for sale of any lot, plot,\\nblock or site thereon. All such maps must be printed or drawn upon\\ntracing cloth or linen or printed on mylar and must be of a standard\\nsize of eighteen inches by twenty inches or thirty-six inches by twenty\\ninches and the original of such maps filed in said county clerk's office\\nshall be placed and kept by some suitable method in consecutive order,\\nbe consecutively numbered in the order of filing and shall be indexed\\nunder the initial letters of all of the substantives in the title of the\\nsubdivision. However, he may maintain a record of such maps in a\\nmicrofilm format provided he supplies facilities for displaying said\\nmaps through projection with microfilm to the aforesaid standard sizes.\\nThe fee of the county clerk for such filing, certifying and indexing\\neach map and copy thereof, and abstract of title therewith and\\nforwarding copies of said map to the assessors, boards of assessors and\\nclerks of the towns and villages where the property therein described is\\nlocated, shall be ten dollars and be paid by the party presenting them\\nfor filing. Failure to file any such map as required by the provisions\\nof this section shall subject the owner of such subdivision or of the\\nunsold lots therein, to a penalty to the people of the state of New York\\nof two hundred fifty dollars for each and every lot therein sold and\\nconveyed by or for such owner prior to the due filing of such map and\\nabstract of title as aforesaid. The requirements as provided for in this\\nsection may be applied to the filing of each and every kind of map\\nsubmitted for filing which is not a subdivision map of real property, at\\nthe discretion of the county clerk, and the filing fee of ten dollars\\nshall be paid for the filing of any non-subdivision map so submitted.\\n  2. Every such subdivision map of property in any of the towns of\\nSuffolk county located wholly or partly outside an incorporated village\\nin such towns, shall, before the filing thereof, as hereinbefore\\nprovided, have indorsed on the face thereof in writing the approval of\\nthe planning board of such towns, or in the towns not having planning\\nboards, the approval of the town board. Likewise, every such subdivision\\nmap of property located wholly or partly within an incorporated village,\\nshall before the filing thereof, as hereinbefore provided, have endorsed\\non the face thereof in writing the approval of the planning board of\\nsuch village, or in a village not having a planning board, the approval\\nof the board of trustees. In addition, every such subdivision map of\\nproperty in any of the towns of the county of Suffolk, whether located\\nwholly or partly, inside or outside, an incorporated village in such\\ntowns, shall before the filing thereof, as hereinbefore provided, have\\nendorsed on the face thereof in writing the approval of the county\\ndepartment of health.\\n  3. Whenever at least two years have elapsed since the filing of a map\\nof the subdivision of any tract of land into lots, plots, blocks or\\nsites, with or without opened or proposed roads, the owner of such\\ntract, or of any part thereof, may abandon and cancel the subdivision of\\nthe property so owned by recording in the office of the county clerk a\\nwritten certificate of abandonment, duly executed and acknowledged,\\nwhich shall contain a description of the property to be abandoned, the\\ncomplete title or name of the map, the filing date and file number\\nthereof, except that no opened or proposed streets, other than those\\nentirely within the bounds of the property to be abandoned, or the area\\nwithin such bounds of streets which as laid out on said map come to a\\ndead-end within such bounds, shall be abandoned unless each owner of a\\nlot or interest in the subdivision consents to the abandonment thereof\\nby instrument in writing duly executed, acknowledged and recorded with\\nthe certificate of abandonment; provided, however, that whenever at\\nleast twenty years have elapsed since the filing of said map, the owner\\nof the property to be abandoned may, without such consent, abandon any\\nstreets or portions thereof shown on said map and which are within the\\nbounds of the property to be abandoned if such streets or portions\\nthereof are neither opened, nor public highways, nor used by the public,\\nnor necessary for the use of owners, occupants or any other persons\\nhaving an interest in any part of the subdivision; but nothing herein\\nshall prevent an owner using or a seller of land from conveying part of\\na lot, plot or site separately or together with an adjoining lot, plot\\nor site, subject to the provisions of local zoning ordinances. Whenever\\nthere is on file more than one map of the property to be abandoned, such\\nproperty must be abandoned in the manner herein provided as to each of\\nsuch maps.  A copy of each certificate of abandonment must be filed with\\nthe assessor and/or board of assessors of each town and village wherein\\nany portion of the property to be abandoned is situated, and the\\nendorsement of approval by each such assessor and/or board of assessors\\nmust be endorsed on the original of each certificate presented to the\\ncounty clerk for recording. An abstract of title to the property to be\\nabandoned covering a period of at least twenty years last past, and a\\ncertificate of the county treasurer of Suffolk county to the effect that\\nthere are no unpaid tax liens against such property, must be submitted\\nto the county clerk and be approved by him at the time the certificate\\nof abandonment and cancellation is offered for recording. Said\\ncertificates and abstracts shall be filed in the county clerk's office,\\na suitable index shall be kept of the same, and notice thereof shall be\\nendorsed by the recording officer upon the map therein referred to at\\nthe time of recording the certificate of abandonment. Where the\\nendorsement of approval of the town or village assessor above referred\\nto includes a recitation to the effect that the municipality has duly\\nadopted an urban renewal plan pursuant to article fifteen of the general\\nmunicipal law which plan provides for adequate street access to all\\nproperties within and adjacent to the planning area, and further that\\nthe property to be abandoned is subject to said plan, and its\\nabandonment is required thereunder, the clerk shall accept and record\\nthe certificate of abandonment tendered therefor regardless of the area\\nthereof, and notwithstanding that the property to be abandoned is a\\nportion of an opened or proposed street for which the consent to the\\nabandonment thereof required in this subdivision has not been obtained.\\nUpon the abandonment of subdivided property as herein provided such\\nproperty shall, for all purposes, be regarded as a single tract of land.\\nNo abandonment of lot divisions shall be made under this section for the\\npurpose of reviving or making effective any other subdivision of the\\nsame tract of land and no map may be reinstated as it was prior to the\\nfiling of any abandonment certificate. The fee of the county clerk for\\nsuch filing and indexing each certificate and abstract therewith shall\\nbe ten dollars and shall be paid by the party presenting them for\\nfiling. Provided, however, that the Suffolk county board of supervisors\\nshall have full authority to abandon any subdivision of property or any\\nportion thereof which the county of Suffolk now owns or may hereafter\\nacquire through the sale of tax liens, by causing to be filed with the\\ncounty clerk of Suffolk county, a certificate of abandonment, duly\\nexecuted by the said county board, without regard to any of the other\\nforegoing requirements of this section. Nothing contained in this\\nsection shall be construed to prevent the filing of a new map and\\ncertificate of a subdivision of real property in the manner prescribed\\nherein, after, and in the area of, a subdivision or portion thereof\\nabandoned in accordance with the provisions of this section.\\n",

Whenever the department of\\nstate shall believe from evidence satisfactory to it that a subdivider\\nhas engaged in, is engaged or is about to engage in any of the practices\\nor transactions heretofore referred to as fraudulent practices, it may\\nhave an action brought in the manner hereinafter provided in the name\\nand on behalf of the people of the state of New York against such\\nsubdivider and any other person or persons theretofore concerned in or\\nin any way participating in or about to participate in such fraudulent\\npractices, to enjoin such subdivider and such other person or persons\\nfrom continuing such fraudulent practices or engaging therein or doing\\nany act or acts in furtherance thereof or, if the department of state\\nshould believe from such evidence that such subdivider has or is engaged\\nin any such fraudulent practice, it may have included in such action an\\napplication to enjoin permanently such subdivider and such other person\\nor persons as may have been or may be concerned with or in any way\\nparticipating in such fraudulent practice, from selling or offering for\\nsale to the public within this state, as principal, owner, subdivider,\\nbroker or agent or otherwise, any vacant land or lands. In said action\\nan order or a judgment may be entered awarding the relief applied for or\\nso much thereof as the court may deem proper. Upon a showing by the\\ndepartment of state in the application brought in its behalf for a\\npreliminary injunction hereunder that the defendant named in the action\\nor an officer thereof has refused to be sworn or to be examined or to\\nanswer a material question or to produce a book or paper relevant to the\\ninquiry when duly ordered so to do by the officer or judge duly\\nconducting an inquiry into the subject matter forming the basis of the\\napplication for such preliminary injunction, such refusal shall be prima\\nfacie proof that such defendant is or has been engaged in fraudulent\\npractices as set forth in such application and a preliminary injunction\\nmay issue from the supreme court without any further showing by the\\ndepartment of state.\\n  2. If the vacant land or lands of a foreign corporation, company,\\nassociation or non-resident individual are offered or advertised for\\nsale within the state of New York and such corporation, company,\\nassociation or non-resident individual has not filed pursuant to laws\\nheretofore or hereafter existing the designation of a person upon whom\\nprocess against him or it may be served or the designation of the\\nsecretary of state as such person pursuant to section two hundred ten of\\nthe general corporation law or other laws heretofore or hereafter\\nexisting or in lieu thereof, an instrument in writing duly acknowledged\\nand filed in the office of the secretary of state designating the\\nsecretary of state as the person upon whom may be served any subpoena,\\nsubpoena duces tecum or other process directed to such foreign\\ncorporation, company, association or non-resident individual and issued\\nin any investigation, examination or proceeding pending or about to be\\ninstituted under and pursuant to the provisions of this article, a\\nnotice may be served upon such foreign corporation, company or\\nassociation, or upon any non-resident officer thereof, or upon a\\nnon-resident individual, by mailing the same in a securely sealed\\npostpaid wrapper addressed to such foreign corporation, company or\\nassociation, or officer thereof, or non-resident individual, at its or\\nhis last known place of business or residence, and may in such notice\\nrequire that such foreign corporation, company or association, or such\\nofficer thereof, or non-resident individual, furnish a written\\nstatement, verified as required in said notice, giving the information\\ntherein specified relating to the vacant land or lands offered or to be\\noffered in the state of New York by such foreign corporation, company,\\nassociation or non-resident individual or, in the alternative, that such\\nforeign corporation, company or association, by its proper officer or\\nofficers, or such non-resident individual, shall appear within a\\nreasonable time from the date of mailing such notice at a designated\\nplace within this state for examination and shall produce at the time\\nand place of such examination such books and papers of such foreign\\ncorporation, company, association or non-resident individual, as may be\\ndesignated in such notice.\\n  If such foreign corporation, company, association, or such officer\\nthereof, or non-resident individual, shall fail to furnish the statement\\ncalled for by such notice, or shall fail to appear pursuant thereto or\\nto produce the books and papers required thereby to be produced, or\\nrefuse to submit to examination or to answer any proper question, the\\nproof of such failure or refusal shall constitute prima facie evidence\\nthat the sale or offering for sale or advertisement of vacant land or\\nlands of such foreign corporation, company, association or non-resident\\nindividual constitutes a fraudulent practice within the meaning of this\\nact and may in the discretion of the court be treated as a sufficient\\nbasis for a permanent injunction against the continuance of such\\nfraudulent practice.\\n  3. In any action brought in behalf of the department of state as\\nprovided in this article, the court at any stage of the proceedings may\\nappoint a receiver of any and all property derived by the defendant or\\ndefendants or any of them by means of any such fraudulent practices,\\nincluding also all property with which such property has been mingled if\\nsuch property can not be identified in kind because of such commingling,\\ntogether with any or all books of account and papers relating to the\\nsame.  The judgment entered in such action may provide that such\\nreceiver shall take title to any or all such property and books of\\naccount and papers relating to the same and liquidate such property or\\nany part thereof for the benefit of all persons intervening in the said\\naction and establishing an interest in such property. The judgment may\\nalso provide that all such property, the title to or interest in which\\nhas not been established in such action by intervenors or otherwise by\\ndue process to be in a person or persons other than defendant or\\ndefendants, shall be returned to the defendant or defendants as their\\ninterest may appear. Such receiver shall be subject to all the duties of\\nreceivers appointed in civil actions as far as practicable except that\\nsuch provisions relating to commissions or compensation of receivers\\nshall not be applicable to receivers appointed pursuant to this section,\\nbut such commissions or compensation shall be fixed by the court in any\\namount which it may determine to be just and equitable. In any action\\nbrought in behalf of the department of state as provided in this article\\nthe court may grant such other and further relief as may be proper.\\n  4. Whenever the department of state has determined to commence an\\naction under this article, it may have the attorney-general present to\\nany justice of the supreme court, before beginning such action, an\\napplication in writing for an order directing the person or persons\\nmentioned in the application to appear before the justice of the supreme\\ncourt or referee designated in such order and answer such questions as\\nmay be put to them or to any of them, or to produce such papers,\\ndocuments and books concerning the alleged fraudulent practices to which\\nthe action which the department of state has determined to bring\\nrelates, and it shall be the duty of the justice of the supreme court to\\nwhom such application for the order is made to grant such application.\\nThe application for such order may simply show upon information and\\nbelief that the testimony of such person or persons is material and\\nnecessary. The provisions of the civil practice law and rules, relating\\nto an application for an order for the examination of witnesses before\\nthe commencement of an action and the method of proceeding on such\\nexamination shall not apply except as herein prescribed. The order shall\\nbe granted by the justice of the supreme court to whom the application\\nhas been made with such preliminary injunction or stay as may appear to\\nsuch justice to be proper and expedient and shall specify the time when\\nand place where the witnesses are required to appear. The justice or\\nreferee may adjourn such examination from time to time and witnesses\\nmust attend accordingly.  The testimony of each witness must be\\nsubscribed by him and all must be filed in the office of the clerk of\\nthe county in which such order for examination is filed.\\n  5. The order for such examination must be signed by the justice making\\nit and service of a copy thereof with an endorsement by the department\\nof state or the attorney-general, to the effect that the person named\\ntherein is required to appear and be examined at the time and place and\\nbefore the justice and referee specified in such endorsement, shall be\\nsufficient notice for the attendance of witnesses, such endorsement may\\ncontain a clause requiring such person to produce at such examination\\nall books, papers and documents in his possession or under his control\\nrelating to the subject of such examination. The order shall be served\\nupon the person named in the endorsement aforesaid by showing him the\\noriginal order and delivering to and leaving with him at the same time a\\ncopy thereof, endorsed as above provided, and by paying or tendering to\\nhim the fee allowed by law to witnesses subpoenaed to attend trials of\\ncivil actions in any court of record in this state.\\n  6. The referee appointed as provided in this article possesses all the\\npowers and is subject to all the duties of a referee appointed in a\\ncivil action, so far as practicable, and may punish for contempt a\\nwitness duly served with the papers as prescribed in this article for\\nnon-attendance or refusal to be sworn or to testify or to produce books,\\npapers and documents according to the direction of the endorsement\\naforesaid, in the same manner and to the same extent as a referee to\\nhear, try and determine an issue of fact or of law.\\n  7. The provisions of the civil practice law and rules shall apply to\\nall actions brought under this article except as herein otherwise\\nprovided.\\n  8. If any person shall ask to be excused from testifying or producing\\nany book, paper or other document before the department of state or the\\nattorney-general or his deputy, or other officer designated by it or him\\nor before any court, or magistrate, or referee, upon any trial,\\ninvestigation or proceeding initiated by the department of state, the\\nattorney-general, district attorney, grand jury or court pursuant to the\\nprovisions of this article upon the ground or for the reason that the\\ntestimony or evidence, documentary or otherwise, required of him may\\ntend to incriminate him or convict him of crime or to subject him to a\\npenalty or forfeiture, and shall notwithstanding be directed by the\\ncourt, referee, magistrate or officer conducting the inquiry to testify\\nor to produce such book, paper or document, he must none the less comply\\nwith such direction but in such event he shall not thereafter be\\nprosecuted or subjected to any penalty or forfeiture for or on account\\nof any transaction, matter or thing concerning which he was ordered to\\ntestify or produce evidence, documentary or otherwise, pursuant thereto\\nand no testimony so given or produced shall be received against him upon\\nany criminal action, suit or proceeding, investigation, inquisition or\\ninquiry.\\n  Provided, however, no person so testifying shall be exempt from\\nprosecution or punishment for any perjury committed by him in his\\ntestimony given as herein provided for, nor shall immunity apply to\\ncorporations or to the officers as such.\\n",

In any event,\\nhowever, the determination of the question as to sufficiency of parties\\nand as to due service of notice shall be for the court as herein\\nprovided.  As soon as possible after the petition is referred to him the\\nofficial examiner of title shall file a preliminary report with the\\nregistrar as to the sufficiency of the parties named in the petition and\\nas to what additional persons, if any, should be made parties to the\\nproceeding.  The official examiner of title shall forthwith proceed to\\nexamine the title and investigate the facts stated in the petition or\\notherwise brought to his notice, and shall make a report in writing to\\nthe court of the substance of the proof and his conclusions therefrom.\\nSaid official examiner's report shall set forth the exact state and\\ncondition of the title sought to be registered which shall contain a\\nfull chain of title disclosing the base, or underlying title and the tax\\nsale title, if there be one, and all mortgages, liens, encumbrances,\\nwills, administrations of estates, and proceedings of all kinds and\\nnature relating to the real property in question, and the names, places\\nof residence with street number, if any, and post office addresses as\\nfar as known or reasonably ascertainable, and the rights or interests,\\nor claimed rights or interests, of the petitioner and of all other\\npersons having or claiming any rights or interests in or liens upon said\\nproperty or any part thereof. It shall contain a statement as to the\\nappearances of parties and a statement as to whether all proper parties\\nin interest have in fact been served with the notice as provided in\\nsection three hundred and eighty-five of this chapter and if so in what\\nmanner, and the recommendation of the official examiner of title as to\\nwhether further notice should be required as to persons residing within\\nor beyond the state from whom registered personal return receipt cards\\nfor the notice of hearing have not been received; it shall contain a\\nproper reference to the survey, map or plan provided for in section\\nthree hundred and eighty-one of this chapter and a statement of all\\nencroachments, if any, on any surrounding contiguous property and the\\nnames, places of residence with street number, if any, and post office\\naddresses of the owners in fee simple of such surrounding contiguous\\nproperties, as far as they are known or can be reasonably ascertained by\\ninquiry on said properties or otherwise; and, as to actual or possible\\nowners or claimants, of the property sought to be registered, not known\\nor not found, it shall state fully what search and efforts have been\\nmade to find them. All possible owners or claimants of the property\\nsought to be registered, or of any right or interest therein or lien\\nthereon, or in or on any part thereof, who cannot be otherwise\\ndescribed, shall be designated in the report and in the notice of\\nhearing on the petition, by the expression, \"all other persons, if any,\\nhaving any right or interest in, or lien upon the property affected by\\nthis proceeding, or any part thereof.\" By the statements of facts\\ncontained in said report of title, or by separate accompanying\\naffidavits, or by any other additional evidences, if necessary, or by\\nany or all of these, sufficient facts must be shown to satisfy the court\\nthat all owners and claimants of the property sought to be registered,\\nor of any right, or interest in or lien upon the same or any part\\nthereof, who could be found by diligent inquiry are duly and\\nspecifically named and made parties to the proceeding.  The question of\\nthe sufficiency of the proof that all such owners and claimants who\\ncould be found by diligent inquiry are duly and specifically named and\\nmade parties to the proceeding and that they have been duly served with\\nthe notice of hearing, shall be for the court; its decision that such\\nproof is sufficient shall be shown by its making an order approving the\\nofficial examiner's report of title or the final order for the\\nregistration of the title, and such decision or order shall be\\nconclusive as a matter of law after thirty days from the time when a\\ncertified copy of the final order and judgment of registration in the\\nproceeding is filed in the office of the registrar of the county in\\nwhich the property is situated. The abstract of title and the searches\\nmade or used by the official examiner of title in the process of his\\nwork of examining the title and all other proper evidences of the due\\nexamination of the title, shall be filed immediately upon the entry of\\nthe final order, in the office of the registrar of the county unless\\notherwise directed by the court and the same shall be open to the\\ninspection of any interested person and shall be subject at all times to\\nthe direction of the court. The abstract of title, the searches and\\nother evidences of title so filed and also all official records referred\\nto therein or in the report of the official examiner of title shall be\\ndeemed to be part of the record of the proceeding. The official\\nexaminer's report of title shall contain a short form of description of\\nthe property the title to which is sought to be registered, which form\\nis to be used in the notice provided for by section three hundred and\\neighty-six of this chapter. Said official examiner's report shall\\ncontain, or be accompanied by, any other or further information that the\\ncourt may prescribe, and shall be in such form as the court may order or\\nas the court of appeals may prescribe in its rules. The official\\nexaminer of title may receive in evidence and may base his report upon\\nany official search or abstract or any search or abstract issued in the\\nregular course of business by any corporation duly organized under and\\nby virtue of the laws of this state and by said laws duly authorized to\\nmake and to certify to searches and abstracts of title or to guarantee\\nor insure titles to real property in this state. It shall be the duty of\\nany public official forthwith to certify the returns of any search upon\\nthe requisition of any official examiner of title and without charge or\\nfees for the same. Where the title to the premises sought to be\\nregistered is in whole or in part the same as that of another parcel of\\nland title to which has been registered, reference to the earlier\\nabstract on file in the county in which the petition is filed may be\\nmade by the official examiner of title in place of duplicating the\\nmatters therein contained. References to official searches duly filed in\\nthe county in which the petition is filed may be made by the official\\nexaminer of title in place of duplicating the matters therein contained.\\nThe papers so referred to shall have the same effect as evidence and\\nproof in the proceeding as said official examiner's report of title, or\\nsaid searches, as the case may be. Where the petition seeks registration\\nof a title subject to restrictive covenants or agreements, it shall not\\nbe necessary to name or serve those persons who have or claim rights to\\nenforce such covenants and agreements, but unless such persons are named\\nand served the final order and judgment of registration must direct that\\nthe title be registered subject to such covenants and agreements.\\n",

An application for such withdrawal from\\nregistration may be filed with the registrar of the county in which the\\ntitle is then registered and shall be entitled \"in the matter of the\\napplication of (stating the name of the registered owner) for the\\nwithdrawal from registration of the title to certain lands.\" Such\\napplication, in such form as may be approved by the registrar, must be\\nmade by the registered owner of the fee of the real property. It shall\\nset forth and recite in detail the name and postoffice address of the\\nregistered owner, the number of the certificate of title last issued,\\nthe date of the last registration of the title, a description of the\\nreal property as stated in the certificate of title together with a\\nreference to the proper section, block and lot numbers if any, a\\ncomplete recital of all memorials entered on the certificate of title,\\nthe names and addresses of all persons owning any incumbrance, charge,\\ntrust or lien on the premises, a statement of all unpaid taxes,\\nassessments and water rates due and payable, a statement of the\\ncircumstances existing which render continued registration of the title\\nimpracticable and inexpedient, and a prayer for the withdrawal from\\nregistration.

The registrar shall file one copy as a document in his office\\nand enter the same as a memorial on the certificate of title to which it\\nrelates. The other copy shall be delivered to an official examiner of\\ntitle who shall forthwith proceed to examine the title since the date of\\nthe first or initial registration thereof and investigate the facts set\\nforth in the application. Thereafter he shall make a report in writing\\nto the supreme court of his findings and a recommendation as to the\\nproper disposition of the application. The registrar shall set down a\\ndate for hearing on the application in the \"title part\" of a special\\nterm of the supreme court, which date shall be not less than twenty days\\nafter the filing of the application; and he shall notify by certified\\nmail demanding a personally signed return receipt card all persons or\\nparties who appear by the report of the official examiner of title to\\nhave any interest in or incumbrance, charge, trust, or lien upon the\\nsaid real property. At the hearing any of the parties in interest may\\nappear and consent or object to the granting of the prayer of the\\napplication. Whether granted or denied, the supreme court shall enter an\\norder disposing of the application and after such order is filed with\\nthe clerk of the county a transcript or certified copy of the same shall\\nbe filed with the registrar and by him entered as a memorial on the\\ncertificate of title. When the order of the supreme court grants a\\nwithdrawal from registration of a title to real property as herein\\nprovided, the registered owner thereof shall forthwith deliver to the\\nregistrar and surrender his owner's duplicate certificate of title, or\\nif the same has been lost or destroyed a new owner's duplicate\\ncertificate of title obtained as provided in section four hundred\\nfourteen of this chapter.

Adverse instruments include, but are not limited to,\\nmechanics' lien claims, judgments, and lis pendens notices.  Adverse\\ninstruments do not include sheriff's deeds, marshall's deeds, or tax\\ndeeds.\\n  b. \"Voluntary instrument\" means any document, instrument or paper that\\neither conveys the fee title to registered land or affects title to\\nregistered land and the validity of which is dependant upon consent by\\nan owner of the registered land or by some person claiming by, through,\\nor under that owner. Voluntary instruments include, but are not limited\\nto, deeds, including tax deeds, sheriff's deeds and marshall's deeds,\\nmortgages, assignments of mortgage, leases and grants of easement or\\nlicense.\\n  c. \"Registered land\" means real property and interests in real\\nproperty, which have been registered under this article.\\n  d. \"Registrar's certificate of title\" means a document issued pursuant\\nto section three hundred ninety-four of this article.\\n  2. On and after the effective date of this section, no title to land\\nmay be registered under this article.  Provided, however, that every\\ncertificate of title or instrument affecting title filed prior to the\\neffective date of this section shall be registered pursuant to the\\nprovisions of this article.\\n  3. On or after the effective date of this section and before January\\nfirst, two thousand, the registrar shall accept only adverse instruments\\nwhich he or she shall register pursuant to this article.\\n  4. On and after the effective date of this section the registrar shall\\nrefuse to accept for registration any instrument that is a voluntary\\ninstrument.  Instead of accepting such instruments for registration, the\\nregistrar shall upon payment of the statutory recording fee, deliver to\\nthe county clerk, or in the counties of Bronx, Kings, Queens and New\\nYork, the register for recording each current certificate of title to\\nall lands affected by that voluntary or adverse instrument. Before\\ndelivering the certificate, the registrar shall memorialize or note on\\nthe certificate any instruments relating to incumbrances, charges,\\ntrusts, liens and transfers that have been filed with the registrar that\\nhave not been memorialized or noted.  A certificate of title shall be\\ndelivered in the form required for recording.\\n  5. On or before January first, two thousand the registrar shall\\ndeliver to the county clerk, or in the counties of Bronx, Kings, Queens\\nand New York, the register for recording the certificates of title of\\nall remaining land which was previously registered under this article.\\nBefore delivering those certificates, the registrar shall memorialize or\\nnote on the certificates any instruments relating to incumbrances,\\ncharges, trusts, liens and transfers that have been filed with the\\nregistrar and that have not yet been memorialized or noted.  A\\ncertificate of title shall be delivered in the form required for\\nrecording.\\n  6.  As of the date of recording of certificates delivered pursuant to\\nsubdivision four or five of this section, the recorded certificates\\nshall be subject only to incumbrances, charges, trusts, liens and\\ntransfers as may be memorialized or noted on the certificate, and free\\nfrom all others except those set forth in section four hundred of this\\narticle.\\n  After the recording of certificates which are delivered under\\nsubdivisions four and five of this section, title to lands shall be\\nconveyed or encumbered in the same manner as set forth in article nine\\nof this chapter.  All instruments noted or memorialized on the\\ncertificates of title so recorded shall have the same force and effect\\nas if they were filed with the county clerk, or in the counties of\\nBronx, Kings, Queens and New York, the register at the time they were\\nnoted or were otherwise memorialized on the certificates of title.  No\\ninstrument, however, that was filed, docketed or recorded by the county\\nclerk, or in the counties of Bronx, Kings, Queens and New York, the\\nregister, but that was not duly registered, shall become a lien,\\nincumbrance, trust or charge against any title which was delivered\\npursuant to subdivisions four and five of this section, unless such\\ninstrument was filed, recorded or docketed after the date such title was\\nrecorded, provided, however, that a judgement docketed by the county\\nclerk prior to the time a certificate of title was recorded shall be\\nvalid as against such land if the landowner received notice of such\\njudgment.\\n  7. Recording of a certificate of title under subdivision four or five\\nof this section, shall not disturb the effect of any proceedings under\\nthe registry system where the question of title to the real property\\nregistered under this article has been determined. All proceedings\\nconcerning the registration of title before delivery to the appropriate\\noffice under subdivision four or five of this section, and all\\nprovisions of this article that relate to the status of the title, shall\\nhave continuing force and effect with respect to the period of time that\\ntitle remained under the registry system. Those provisions giving rise\\nto a right of action for damages against the county shall also continue\\nin force and effect with respect to the period of time that title\\nremained under the registry system.\\n  8. Nothing contained in this section terminates, diminishes or impairs\\nany existing right in or pertaining to registered land or any existing\\nright to resort to the assurance fund created under sections four\\nhundred twenty-six through four hundred twenty-nine of this article and\\nthat right may be asserted and enforced in the same manner, to the same\\nextent, and subject to the same limitations as provided in those\\nsections.\\n  9. No claim shall be made based upon prescription or adverse\\npossession for land which was recorded under subdivision four or five of\\nthis section and which was previously registered under this article\\nuntil after such time as the property is transferred or conveyed and the\\nelements of such claims may be established against a subsequent owner.\\n",

The secretary of state,\\nand not the state real estate board established under section four\\nhundred forty-two-i of this article, shall adopt such rules and\\nregulations as the secretary of state may determine are necessary for\\nthe administration and enforcement of this section.\\n  2. (a) If, after a public hearing and a reasonable investigation, the\\nsecretary of state determines that the owners of residential real\\nproperty within a defined geographic area are subject to intense and\\nrepeated solicitations by real estate brokers and salespersons or others\\nto place their property for sale with such real estate brokers or\\nsalespersons, or otherwise to sell their property, and that such\\nsolicitations have caused owners to reasonably believe that property\\nvalues may decrease because persons of different race, ethnic, social,\\nor religious backgrounds are moving or are about to move into the\\nneighborhood or geographic area, the secretary of state may adopt a\\nrule, to be known as a nonsolicitation order, directing all real estate\\nbrokers, salespersons and other persons regularly engaged in the trade\\nor business of buying and selling real estate to refrain from soliciting\\nresidential real estate listings or otherwise soliciting the sale of\\nresidential real estate within the subject area. Each area subject to\\nsuch an order shall be bounded or otherwise specifically defined in the\\norder. The nonsolicitation order shall be subject to such terms and\\nconditions as the secretary of state may determine are, on balance, in\\nthe best interest of the public, including but not limited to the\\naffected owners and licensees. A nonsolicitation order may prohibit any\\nor all types of solicitation directed towards particular home-owners,\\nincluding but not limited to letters, postcards, telephone calls,\\ndoor-to-door calls, and handbills. Every nonsolicitation order shall\\ncontain a provision setting forth the day, month and year that the order\\nshall become effective, as well as the day, month and year that the\\norder shall expire. A nonsolicitation order shall not be effective for\\nmore than five years. However, a nonsolicitation order and the\\nboundaries of the area where it applies may be re-adopted or amended\\nfrom time to time in accordance with the procedures set forth herein.\\n  (b) No real estate broker shall establish a new principal office or\\nbranch office within any geographic area which is the subject of a\\nnonsolicitation order without prior approval from the secretary of\\nstate. The secretary of state may deny any application for the\\nestablishment or relocation of a principal office or branch office if\\napproval of the application would cause the total number of principal\\nand branch offices within the subject area to exceed the total number of\\nprincipal and branch offices that were licensed within the area on the\\ndate the nonsolicitation order became effective.\\n  3. (a) If the secretary of state determines that some owners of\\nresidential real property within a defined geographic area are subject\\nto intense and repeated solicitation by real estate brokers and\\nsalespersons to place their property for sale with such real estate\\nbrokers or salespersons, or are subject to intense and repeated\\nsolicitation by other persons regularly engaged in the trade or business\\nof buying and selling real estate to sell their real estate, the\\nsecretary of state may adopt a rule establishing a cease and desist\\nzone, which zone shall be bounded or otherwise specifically defined in\\nthe rule. After the secretary of state has established a cease and\\ndesist zone, the owners of residential real property located within the\\nzone may file an owner's statement with the secretary of state\\nexpressing their wish not to be solicited by real estate brokers,\\nsalespersons or other persons regularly engaged in the trade or business\\nof buying and selling real estate. The form and content of the statement\\nshall be prescribed by the secretary of state. After a cease and desist\\nzone has been established by the secretary of state, no real estate\\nbroker, salesperson or other person regularly engaged in the trade or\\nbusiness of buying and selling real estate shall solicit a listing from\\nany owner who has filed a statement with the secretary of state if such\\nowner's name appears on the current cease and desist list prepared by\\nthe secretary of state. The prohibition on solicitation shall apply to\\ndirect forms of solicitation such as the use of the telephone, the mail,\\npersonal contact and other forms of direct solicitation as may be\\nspecified by the secretary of state.\\n  (b) The secretary of state shall compile a cease and desist list for\\neach zone established pursuant to paragraph (a) of this subdivision. In\\naddition to such other information as the secretary of state may deem\\nappropriate, each cease and desist list shall contain the name of each\\nowner who has filed an owner's statement with the secretary, as well as\\nthe address of the property within the zone to which the owner's\\nstatement applies. The secretary of state shall send to each owner who\\nhas filed an owner's statement a written acknowledgement of the\\nsecretary of state's receipt thereof and a pamphlet explaining to the\\nowner his or her rights in connection therewith and the procedures and\\ntime limits applicable to the filing of complaints for violations. The\\nsecretary of state shall allow an owner who files, or on behalf of whom\\nis filed, a complaint or other report of a violation of a cease and\\ndesist rule ninety days in which to perfect a complaint by submitting\\nsuch other or further information or documents as the secretary of state\\nmay require. The secretary of state shall print a list for each zone.\\nEach list shall be revised and reprinted at least annually on or before\\nDecember thirty-first and shall be made available to the public and to\\nreal estate brokers at a reasonable price to be set by the secretary of\\nstate and approved by the director of the division of the budget.\\nAdditions or deletions shall be made to each list only at the time the\\nlist is reprinted, and the secretary of state shall not issue amendments\\nor addenda to any printed list.\\n  (c) No rule establishing a cease and desist zone shall be effective\\nfor longer than five years. However, the secretary of state may re-adopt\\nthe rule to continue the cease and desist zone for additional periods\\nnot to exceed five years each. Whenever a rule establishing a cease and\\ndesist zone shall have expired or shall have been repealed, all owner's\\nstatements filed with the secretary of state pursuant to that rule shall\\nalso expire. However, an owner may file a new statement with the\\nsecretary of state if a new rule is adopted establishing a cease and\\ndesist zone containing the owner's property. Once the boundaries of a\\ncease and desist zone have been established by rule of the secretary of\\nstate, the boundaries may not be changed except by repeal of the\\nexisting rule and adoption of a new rule establishing the new\\nboundaries.\\n",

The law may require each agent assisting in the transaction to\\npresent you with this disclosure form. A real estate agent is a person\\nqualified to advise about real estate.\\n  If you need legal, tax or other advice, consult with a professional in\\nthat field.\\n          DISCLOSURE REGARDING REAL ESTATE AGENCY RELATIONSHIPS\\n                             SELLER'S AGENT\\n  A seller's agent is an agent who is engaged by a seller to represent\\nthe seller's interests. The seller's agent does this by securing a buyer\\nfor the seller's home at a price and on terms acceptable to the seller.\\nA seller's agent has, without limitation, the following fiduciary duties\\nto the seller: reasonable care, undivided loyalty, confidentiality, full\\ndisclosure, obedience and duty to account. A seller's agent does not\\nrepresent the interests of the buyer. The obligations of a seller's\\nagent are also subject to any specific provisions set forth in an\\nagreement between the agent and the seller. In dealings with the buyer,\\na seller's agent should (a) exercise reasonable skill and care in\\nperformance of the agent's duties; (b) deal honestly, fairly and in good\\nfaith; and (c) disclose all facts known to the agent materially\\naffecting the value or desirability of property, except as otherwise\\nprovided by law.\\n                              BUYER'S AGENT\\n  A buyer's agent is an agent who is engaged by a buyer to represent the\\nbuyer's interests. The buyer's agent does this by negotiating the\\npurchase of a home at a price and on terms acceptable to the buyer. A\\nbuyer's agent has, without limitation, the following fiduciary duties to\\nthe buyer: reasonable care, undivided loyalty, confidentiality, full\\ndisclosure, obedience and duty to account. A buyer's agent does not\\nrepresent the interests of the seller. The obligations of a buyer's\\nagent are also subject to any specific provisions set forth in an\\nagreement between the agent and the buyer. In dealings with the seller,\\na buyer's agent should (a) exercise reasonable skill and care in\\nperformance of the agent's duties; (b) deal honestly, fairly and in good\\nfaith; and (c) disclose all facts known to the agent materially\\naffecting the buyer's ability and/or willingness to perform a contract\\nto acquire seller's property that are not inconsistent with the agent's\\nfiduciary duties to the buyer.\\n                             BROKER'S AGENTS\\n  A broker's agent is an agent that cooperates or is engaged by a\\nlisting agent or a buyer's agent (but does not work for the same firm as\\nthe listing agent or buyer's agent) to assist the listing agent or\\nbuyer's agent in locating a property to sell or buy, respectively, for\\nthe listing agent's seller or the buyer agent's buyer. The broker's\\nagent does not have a direct relationship with the buyer or seller and\\nthe buyer or seller can not provide instructions or direction directly\\nto the broker's agent. The buyer and the seller therefore do not have\\nvicarious liability for the acts of the broker's agent. The listing\\nagent or buyer's agent do provide direction and instruction to the\\nbroker's agent and therefore the listing agent or buyer's agent will\\nhave liability for the acts of the broker's agent.\\n                               DUAL AGENT\\n  A real estate broker may represent both the buyer and the seller if\\nboth the buyer and seller give their informed consent in writing. In\\nsuch a dual agency situation, the agent will not be able to provide the\\nfull range of fiduciary duties to the buyer and seller. The obligations\\nof an agent are also subject to any specific provisions set forth in an\\nagreement between the agent, and the buyer and seller. An agent acting\\nas a dual agent must explain carefully to both the buyer and seller that\\nthe agent is acting for the other party as well. The agent should also\\nexplain the possible effects of dual representation, including that by\\nconsenting to the dual agency relationship the buyer and seller are\\ngiving up their right to undivided loyalty. A buyer or seller should\\ncarefully consider the possible consequences of a dual agency\\nrelationship before agreeing to such representation. A seller or buyer\\nmay provide advance informed consent to dual agency by indicating the\\nsame on this form.\\n                               DUAL AGENT\\n                                  WITH\\n                         DESIGNATED SALES AGENTS\\n  If the buyer and the seller provide their informed consent in writing,\\nthe principals and the real estate broker who represents both parties as\\na dual agent may designate a sales agent to represent the buyer and\\nanother sales agent to represent the seller to negotiate the purchase\\nand sale of real estate. A sales agent works under the supervision of\\nthe real estate broker. With the informed consent of the buyer and the\\nseller in writing, the designated sales agent for the buyer will\\nfunction as the buyer's agent representing the interests of and\\nadvocating on behalf of the buyer and the designated sales agent for the\\nseller will function as the seller's agent representing the interests of\\nand advocating on behalf of the seller in the negotiations between the\\nbuyer and seller. A designated sales agent cannot provide the full range\\nof fiduciary duties to the buyer or seller. The designated sales agent\\nmust explain that like the dual agent under whose supervision they\\nfunction, they cannot provide undivided loyalty. A buyer or seller\\nshould carefully consider the possible consequences of a dual agency\\nrelationship with designated sales agents before agreeing to such\\nrepresentation. A seller or buyer may provide advance informed consent\\nto dual agency with designated sales agents by indicating the same on\\nthis form.\\n  This form was provided to me by ____________________ (print name of\\nlicensee) of ____________________________ (print name of company, firm\\nor brokerage), a licensed real estate broker acting in the interest of\\nthe:\\n   (  ) Seller as a         (  ) Buyer as a\\n (check relationship below)  (check relationship below)\\n   (  ) Seller's agent      (  ) Buyer's agent\\n   (  ) Broker's agent      (  ) Broker's agent\\n   (  ) Dual agent          (  ) Dual agent with designated sales agents\\n  For advance informed consent to either dual agency or dual agency with\\ndesignated sales agents complete section below:\\n   (  ) Advance informed consent dual agency.\\n   (  ) Advance informed consent to dual agency with designated sales\\nagents.\\n  If dual agent with designated sales agents is indicated above:\\n  ____________________ is appointed to represent the buyer; and\\n  ____________________ is appointed to represent the seller in this\\ntransaction.\\n  (I)(We) acknowledge receipt of a copy of this disclosure form:\\n  Signature of { } Buyer(s) and/or { } Seller(s):\\n  ____________________             ____________________\\n  ____________________             ____________________\\n  Date:_______________             Date:_______________\\n  b.

The landlord's agent does this by\\nsecuring a tenant for the landlord's apartment or house at a rent and on\\nterms acceptable to the landlord. A landlord's agent has, without\\nlimitation, the following fiduciary duties to the landlord: reasonable\\ncare, undivided loyalty, confidentiality, full disclosure, obedience and\\nduty to account. A landlord's agent does not represent the interests of\\nthe tenant. The obligations of a landlord's agent are also subject to\\nany specific provisions set forth in an agreement between the agent and\\nthe landlord. In dealings with the tenant, a landlord's agent should (a)\\nexercise reasonable skill and care in performance of the agent's duties;\\n(b) deal honestly, fairly and in good faith; and (c) disclose all facts\\nknown to the agent materially affecting the value or desirability of\\nproperty, except as otherwise provided by law.\\n                             TENANT'S AGENT\\n  A tenant's agent is an agent who is engaged by a tenant to represent\\nthe tenant's interest. The tenant's agent does this by negotiating the\\nrental or lease of an apartment or house at a rent and on terms\\nacceptable to the tenant. A tenant's agent has, without limitation, the\\nfollowing fiduciary duties to the tenant: reasonable care, undivided\\nloyalty, confidentiality, full disclosure, obedience and duty to\\naccount. A tenant's agent does not represent the interest of the\\nlandlord. The obligations of a tenant's agent are also subject to any\\nspecific provisions set forth in an agreement between the agent and the\\ntenant. In dealings with the landlord, a tenant's agent should (a)\\nexercise reasonable skill and care in performance of the agent's duties;\\n(b) deal honestly, fairly and in good faith; and (c) disclose all facts\\nknown to the  tenant's ability and/or willingness to perform a contract\\nto rent or lease landlord's property that are not inconsistent with the\\nagent's fiduciary duties to the buyer.\\n                             BROKER'S AGENTS\\n  A broker's agent is an agent that cooperates or is engaged by a\\nlisting agent or a tenant's agent (but does not work for the same firm\\nas the listing agent or tenant's agent) to assist the listing agent or\\ntenant's agent in locating a property to rent or lease for the listing\\nagent's landlord or the tenant agent's tenant. The broker's agent does\\nnot have a direct relationship with the tenant or landlord and the\\ntenant or landlord can not provide instructions or direction directly to\\nthe broker's agent. The tenant and the landlord therefore do not have\\nvicarious liability for the acts of the broker's agent. The listing\\nagent or tenant's agent do provide direction and instruction to the\\nbroker's agent and therefore the listing agent or tenant's agent will\\nhave liability for the acts of the broker's agent.\\n                               DUAL AGENT\\n  A real estate broker may represent both the tenant and the landlord if\\nboth the tenant and landlord give their informed consent in writing. In\\nsuch a dual agency situation, the agent will not be able to provide the\\nfull range of fiduciary duties to the landlord and the tenant. The\\nobligations of an agent are also subject to any specific provisions set\\nforth in an agreement between the agent, and the tenant and landlord. An\\nagent acting as a dual agent must explain carefully to both the landlord\\nand tenant that the agent is acting for the other party as well. The\\nagent should also explain the possible effects of dual representation,\\nincluding that by consenting to the dual agency relationship the\\nlandlord and tenant are giving up their right to undivided loyalty. A\\nlandlord and tenant should carefully consider the possible consequences\\nof a dual agency relationship before agreeing to such representation.  A\\nlandlord or tenant may provide advance informed consent to dual agency\\nby indicating the same on this form.\\n                               DUAL AGENT\\n                                  WITH\\n                         DESIGNATED SALES AGENTS\\n  If the tenant and the landlord provide their informed consent in\\nwriting, the principals and the real estate broker who represents both\\nparties as a dual agent may designate a sales agent to represent the\\ntenant and another sales agent to represent the landlord. A sales agent\\nworks under the supervision of the real estate broker. With the informed\\nconsent in writing of the tenant and the landlord, the designated sales\\nagent for the tenant will function as the tenant's agent representing\\nthe interests of and advocating on behalf of the tenant and the\\ndesignated sales agent for the landlord will function as the landlord's\\nagent representing the interests of and advocating on behalf of the\\nlandlord in the negotiations between the tenant and the landlord. A\\ndesignated sales agent cannot provide the full range of fiduciary duties\\nto the landlord or tenant. The designated sales agent must explain that\\nlike the dual agent under whose supervision they function, they cannot\\nprovide undivided loyalty. A landlord or tenant should carefully\\nconsider the possible consequences of a dual agency relationship with\\ndesignated sales agents before agreeing to such representation.  A\\nlandlord or tenant may provide advance informed consent to dual agency\\nwith designated sales agents by indicating the same on this form.\\n  This form was provided to me by _____________________ (print name of\\nlicensee) of __________________ (print name of company, firm or\\nbrokerage), a licensed real estate broker acting in the interest of the:\\n   (  ) Landlord as a     (  ) Tenant as a\\n(check relationship below) (check relationship below)\\n   (  ) Landlord's agent  (  ) Tenant's agent\\n   (  ) Broker's agent    (  ) Broker's agent\\n   (  ) Dual agent        (  ) Dual agent with designated sales agents\\n  For advance informed consent to either dual agency or dual agency with\\ndesignated sales agents complete section below:\\n   (  ) Advance informed consent dual agency.\\n   (  ) Advance informed consent to dual agency with designated sales\\nagents.\\n  If dual agent with designated sales agents is indicated above:\\n  _________________________ is appointed to represent the tenant; and\\n  _________________________ is appointed to represent the landlord in\\nthis transaction.\\n  (I) (We) _____________________________________________ acknowledge\\nreceipt of a copy of this disclosure form:\\n    Signature of { } Landlord(s) and/or { } Tenant(s):\\n______________________________________________________\\n_______________________________________________________\\nDate: _______________              Date: ________________\\n  5.
