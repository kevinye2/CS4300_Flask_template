Acquisition of abandoned railroad transportation property. 1.\\nNotwithstanding the provisions of any general, special or local law to\\nthe contrary, the commissioner shall have a preferential right to\\nacquire, for and in behalf of the people of the state of New York, for\\nuse in the future for transportation purposes, as such purposes are set\\nforth in this chapter, the highway law or the canal law, any property as\\ndefined in subdivision six of this section and which has been abandoned\\nfor railroad transportation purposes as defined in subdivision two of\\nthis section. No property owner shall dispose of any such property\\nwithout having first obtained notification from the commissioner that\\nthe preferential right of acquisition granted under this section does\\nnot apply, or a release of such preferential right from the\\ncommissioner. Conveyances of property in violation of this section shall\\nbe null and void. Acquisition of property pursuant to this section shall\\nbe in the manner provided by section thirty of the highway law. No\\nacquisition shall be made until the director of the budget shall have\\nissued a certificate of availability of funds therefor. Before any\\nproperty is acquired pursuant to this section, the commissioner shall\\ndetermine that it is in the best interests of the state to acquire such\\nproperty for use in the future for transportation purposes.\\n  1-a. The department of transportation is hereby designated the\\nofficial state agency to receive all notifications from the United\\nStates department of transportation or any other federal or state agency\\nin regard to discontinuance of service or railroad property abandonment\\nproceedings, including notification of applications from railroad\\ncompanies for any such purposes.\\n  1-b. The department of transportation shall promptly inform in writing\\nall interested state agencies, transportation authorities, and every\\ncounty, city, town and village in which such property is located and the\\nappropriate entity designated by the governor pursuant to title IV of\\nthe federal intergovernmental cooperation act of nineteen hundred\\nsixty-eight and the federal office of management and budget circular\\nA-98 of (a) the issuance of any certificate from the United States\\ndepartment of transportation or other federal or state agency\\nauthorizing discontinuance of railroad service or abandonment of\\nrailroad transportation property, (b) approval of discontinuance of\\nservice or a determination of abandonment of railroad transportation\\nproperty pursuant to this section, and (c) the receipt of an application\\nto release a preferential acquisition right to railroad transportation\\nproperty pursuant to this section.\\n  1-c. Whenever a property owner intends to dispose of abandoned\\nrailroad transportation property, it shall notify the department of\\ntransportation in writing of its intention. Upon receipt of such\\nnotification, the department of transportation shall have ninety days to\\nmake a determination and notify the property owner as to the\\napplicability of the preferential right of acquisition granted under\\nthis section, except that this period may be suspended by the department\\nupon its finding that the property owner has not submitted information\\nsufficient to enable the department to make its determination. If\\nsuspended, this period will resume upon receipt of this required\\ninformation. In the event the department fails to notify the property\\nowner of its determination, the preferential right of acquisition shall\\nbe deemed not to apply. The department shall inform the appropriate\\nstate agencies, every metropolitan or regional transportation authority\\nand every county, city, town and village in which such railroad property\\nor portion thereof is located, of the intention of the property owner\\nand the department's finding of applicability of the preferential right\\nof acquisition. If notified by the department that the preferential\\nright of acquisition does not extend to the subject property, or the\\ndepartment has not notified the property owner of its determination\\nprior to the expiration of the foregoing ninety day period,\\nnotwithstanding any suspension, the property owner shall not enter into\\na binding contract to sell the property within forty-five days after\\nthis notification by the department. Such state agencies, metropolitan\\nor regional transportation authorities, and counties, cities, towns and\\nvillages shall have preferential acquisition rights to be determined as\\nherein provided. No state agency, metropolitan or regional\\ntransportation authority, county, city, town, or village shall have any\\npreferential right of acquisition unless specifically authorized in\\nwriting by the department. Within a reasonable time thereafter, any\\nagency of government which intends to exercise a preferential\\nacquisition right for such property shall notify the department of\\ntransportation in writing. Within a reasonable time, not greater than\\none hundred twenty days after receipt of such notification by the\\nproperty owner, the department of transportation shall notify the\\nproperty owner in writing whether the department of transportation\\nintends to exercise its preferential acquisition right under this\\nsection or, if not, whether it has determined that any other agency of\\ngovernment has been authorized by it to exercise a preferential\\nacquisition right to such property. If the department of transportation\\nnotifies the property owner that it does not intend to exercise its\\nright and that it has not authorized any other state or local agency of\\ngovernment to so exercise its right, the commissioner shall issue the\\nproperty owner a written release of the preferential acquisition rights\\ngranted under this section. In the event the department fails to provide\\nnotice of the intent to release the preferential right of acquisition,\\nsuch right shall be deemed to have expired. If the department of\\ntransportation, or any other state or local agency of government shall\\nbe qualified to exercise such preferential acquisition right, the\\ndepartment of transportation shall notify the property owner of such\\nintention and the property owner shall not dispose of such abandoned\\nrailroad transportation property without first having obtained a release\\nof the preferential right from the department of transportation. There\\nshall be good faith bargaining between the property owner and the\\ndepartment or any party of interest either authorized by the department\\nto exercise the preferential right of acquisition or notified by the\\ndepartment as to the inapplicability of the preferential right of\\nacquisition. The department of transportation shall issue a written\\nrelease of the preferential acquisition right within one hundred eighty\\ndays after demand by the property owner, or such right will be deemed to\\nhave been expired. The department shall make a good faith effort to\\nissue such release.\\n  1-d. Whenever a conflict occurs between one or more agencies of\\ngovernment as to the exercise of a preferential right, the department of\\ntransportation shall in the exercise of its sole discretion resolve such\\nconflict and make a prompt determination of the reasonable and proper\\norder of priority with respect to the same. In making such\\ndetermination, the department shall take into consideration the\\nprovisions of the comprehensive state-wide master transportation plan\\nand its actions shall be consistent to the extent practicable with the\\neffectuation of all state plans, policies and objectives.\\n  1-e. The commissioner of transportation shall promulgate rules and\\nregulations consistent with and for the purpose of adequately\\nimplementing the foregoing subdivisions.\\n  2. For the purposes of this section, property shall be deemed to be\\nabandoned for railroad transportation purposes (a) when, where required\\nby law, a certificate of abandonment of the railroad line situate\\nthereon has been issued by the United States department of\\ntransportation and/or any other federal or state agency having\\njurisdiction thereof; or (b) when such a certificate of abandonment is\\nnot so required and the use of such property for railroad transportation\\npurposes has been discontinued with the intent not to resume. Intent not\\nto resume may be inferred from circumstances. Non-use of the property\\nfor railroad transportation purposes for two consecutive years shall\\ncreate a presumption of abandonment. When use of such property for\\nrailroad transportation purposes has been discontinued and upon request\\nof the property owner or his own motion, the commissioner shall\\nundertake an investigation thereof, which may include consultation with\\nthe United States department of transportation, and shall render a\\ndetermination as to whether or not (a) the property owner has definite\\nplans for the use of such property for purposes ordinarily associated\\nwith the safe and normal operation of a railroad or associated\\ntransportation purposes; (b) such property continues to be suitable for\\nsuch railroad transportation purposes; and (c) such property is\\nnecessary, either presently or in the future, for such railroad\\ntransportation purposes. Such property shall be deemed to be abandoned\\nfor railroad transportation purposes if the commissioner shall determine\\nthat (a) the property owner has no definite plans for the use of such\\nproperty for purposes ordinarily associated with the safe and normal\\noperation of a railroad or associated transportation purposes; or (b)\\nsuch property is no longer suitable for such railroad transportation\\npurposes; and (c) such property is not necessary, either presently or in\\nthe future, for such railroad transportation purposes. The commissioner\\nshall render such determination within ninety days after the\\ncommencement of such investigation and such determination shall be\\nconclusive except that if the property is determined not to be so\\nabandoned such determination shall not preclude the undertaking of a\\nsubsequent investigation concerning the same property. Sales of\\nabandoned railroad transportation property for continued or resumed rail\\ntransportation use may be exempted at the commissioner's discretion from\\nthe preferential right of acquisition. This section shall not apply to\\nthe subsequent resale of property lawfully acquired subject to the\\nprovisions of this section as then applicable, except when the\\nsubsequent sale involves property previously exempted from this section\\nby the commissioner.\\n  3. The expense of the acquisition of property including the cost of\\nmaking surveys and preparing descriptions and maps of property to be\\nacquired, and of administrative duties in connection therewith, serving\\nnotice of appropriation, publication, making title searches, appraisals\\nand agreements, and examinations and readings and approval of titles\\nmade by the attorney-general, expenses incurred by the commissioner or\\nthe attorney-general in proceedings for removal of owners or occupants,\\nand expenses incurred by the commissioner in connection with the\\nmanagement and supervision of the property, shall together be deemed to\\nconstitute the cost of property acquired pursuant to this section. The\\ncomptroller is hereby authorized to charge against the moneys\\nappropriated for highway or other transportation purposes and to reserve\\ntherefrom such sums as may be sufficient to defray the necessary\\nexpenses to be incurred by the attorney general for examination,\\nreadings and approval of titles, upon the filing with him by the\\nattorney general from time to time of a certificate or certificates\\napproved by the commissioner setting forth such estimated expenses. Such\\nexpenses shall be paid from the funds so reserved after audit by the\\nstate comptroller.\\n  4. Any moneys received by the commissioner from rentals or other\\nsources of revenue in connection with the management, operations,\\noccupancy, use or the sale of or exchange of property, under this\\nsection, that has been acquired by the commissioner pursuant to this\\nsection shall be deposited in the treasury of the state to the credit of\\nthe capital construction fund.\\n  5. The commissioner may determine whether any property acquired\\npursuant to this section may be, in whole or in part, sold or exchanged\\non terms beneficial to the state, and in all cases of such\\ndetermination, he may, notwithstanding the provisions of any general,\\nspecial or local law, so dispose of such property. In order to carry any\\nsuch sale or exchange into effect, the commissioner of transportation is\\nhereby authorized to execute and deliver, in the name of the people of\\nthe state, a quitclaim of, or a grant in and to, such property. Each\\nsuch instrument of conveyance shall be prepared by the attorney general\\nand before delivery thereof, shall be approved by him as to form and\\nmanner of execution.\\n  6. The term \"property\" as used in this section means all abandoned\\nrailroad property, except:\\n  (a) property noncontiguous to line rights of way and yards, except\\nwhen such property has been made noncontiguous as a result of a previous\\nsale or release of the preferential right, and\\n  (b) side and spur track properties not greater than one-fourth mile in\\nlength, except when sales of such property would make adjoining rights\\nof way noncontiguous.\\n  7. The commissioner, when he deems it necessary, may in the manner\\nprovided by subdivision twelve of section thirty of the highway law,\\nobtain possession of any property acquired pursuant to this section.\\n  8. The commissioner, in the manner provided by subdivision thirteen-c\\nof section thirty of the highway law, shall manage and receive fair and\\nreasonable value for the holding, use or occupancy of property acquired\\npursuant to this section.\\n  9. The provisions of this section shall not apply to a railroad\\ncompany owned and operated by a municipal corporation.\\n",

Within the amounts made available therefor by appropriation, a\\nstatewide mass transportation operating assistance program is hereby\\nestablished for the purpose of making payments toward the operating\\nexpenses of public transportation systems. For the purposes of this\\nsection, the term public transportation system shall mean any public\\nbenefit corporation constituting a transportation authority which\\nprovides or contracts for the provision of (under joint support\\narrangements) mass transportation services, or a subsidiary thereof, or\\nany county or city which provides or contracts for the provision of\\n(pursuant to section one hundred nineteen-r of the general municipal\\nlaw) mass transportation services.\\n  2. a. On and after May first, nineteen hundred seventy-four, the\\ncommissioner shall pay to each public transportation system that makes\\nan application therefor, in quarterly installments, a mass\\ntransportation operating assistance service payment to be determined and\\ncomputed as follows: the chief executive officer of each such system\\nshall certify to the commissioner not more than thirty days nor less\\nthan fifteen days prior to the date of commencement of any quarter for\\nwhich an installment is payable, the total number of passengers such\\nsystem estimates that it will carry and the total number of vehicle or\\ncar miles such system estimates that its equipment will travel in\\nrevenue service during the quarter for which such installment is to be\\npaid. Upon receipt of any such certification, the commissioner shall\\nprovide to the public transportation system a service payment, which\\npayment shall be computed by adding the sum of (i) the certified number\\nof passengers multiplied by one and four-tenths cents per passenger,\\n(ii) the certified number of vehicle or car miles multiplied by nine\\ncents per vehicle or car mile, and (iii) the amount obtained by\\nmultiplying the total number of persons within the urban area served by\\nthe public transportation system, as determined by the most current\\nfederal decennial census, by ten cents per capita; provided, however,\\nthat any service payment made by the commissioner to any county or city\\non account of such county's or city's contracts for mass transportation\\nservices (pursuant to section one hundred nineteen-r of the general\\nmunicipal law), shall not include an amount computed under item (iii)\\nabove. Such quarterly installments shall be payable not later than the\\ntenth day of each successive quarter, with the quarters commencing on\\nthe first day of May, August, November and February, respectively;\\nprovided, however, that for the first quarter of May first through July\\nthirty-first, nineteen hundred seventy-four, such quarterly installment\\nmay be made on or before June fifteenth, nineteen hundred seventy-four\\nand the chief executive officer of any public transportation system\\nmaking application hereunder shall make the required certifications not\\nmore than thirty nor less than fifteen days prior to such date.\\n  b. Each public transportation system receiving a quarterly service\\npayment pursuant to this subdivision shall certify to the commissioner,\\nwithin five days of the end of each quarter for which a service payment\\nwas received, the actual total number of passengers carried by the\\nsystem during such quarter and the actual total vehicle or car miles the\\nsystem's equipment traveled in revenue service during such quarter, and\\nbased upon such actual totals, the commissioner shall make such\\nadjustments as may be appropriate in the amount of the service payment\\nfor such system for the succeeding quarter.\\n  3. Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision two of this section,\\nthe commissioner may establish with respect to any public transportation\\nsystem a maximum service payment, limiting the amount of state\\nassistance for which such system may qualify, where it appears that the\\ntotal amount of money appropriated or allocated to a group of\\nunspecified public transportation systems is less than the total amount\\nof money for which the entire group is eligible. Such maximum service\\npayments may be established on a quarterly or annual basis, in the\\ndiscretion of the commissioner; provided, however, that the sum of all\\nof the maximum service payments established during the period covered by\\nthe appropriation, shall equal the amount of the appropriation or\\nallocation.\\n  4. a. For any quarter commencing on or after May first, nineteen\\nhundred seventy-four, any county or city served by a public\\ntransportation system that receives a service payment pursuant to\\nsubdivision two of this section shall, not later than the fifteenth day\\nfollowing the commencement of the quarter for which the payment is made\\nor the date on which the payment is made, whichever is later, pay to the\\npublic transportation system a sum equal to such service payment, except\\nthat in the case of a service payment made to a public transportation\\nsystem on account of mass transportation services provided to more than\\none county (considering the city of New York to be one county), each\\ncounty receiving such services from such system shall pay to the system\\na sum equal to its share of the service payment, which sum shall be\\ndetermined in accordance with the percentage or dollar amounts\\nestablished for such county by the legislature.\\n  b. The payment required of any county or city by paragraph a of this\\nsubdivision shall be in addition to all other forms of assistance now\\nprovided or scheduled to be provided to any public transportation system\\nby any county or city, whether directly or indirectly; provided,\\nhowever, that where any county or city pays all of the operating deficit\\nof a public transportation system within such county or city, the amount\\nof assistance provided by such county or city to such public\\ntransportation system may be reduced to the extent of the service\\npayment, but in no event to an amount less than the service payment.\\n  c. In the event that a county or city shall fail to make to a public\\ntransportation system any of the payments required to be made by it\\nunder this subdivision, the chief executive officer of the public\\ntransportation system or such other person as the commissioner shall\\ndesignate shall certify to the state comptroller such amount due and\\nowing such public transportation system and the state comptroller shall\\nwithhold an equivalent amount from state aid allocated to such county or\\ncity from highway aid, the motor fuel tax and the motor vehicle\\nregistration fee distributed pursuant to section one hundred twelve of\\nthe highway law, or per capita local assistance pursuant to section\\nfifty-four of the state finance law subject to the following\\nlimitations: prior to withholding amounts allocated to carry such county\\nor city, the comptroller shall pay in full any amount due the state of\\nNew York municipal bond bank agency, on account of any such county's or\\ncity's obligation to such agency; the city university construction fund,\\npursuant to the provisions of the city university construction fund act;\\nthe New York city housing development corporation, pursuant to the\\nprovisions of the New York city housing development corporation act\\n(article twelve of the private housing finance law); and the transit\\nconstruction fund, pursuant to the provisions of article two, title nine\\nof the public authorities law. The comptroller shall give the director\\nof the budget notification of any such payment. Such amount or amounts\\nso withheld by the state comptroller shall be paid to such public\\ntransportation system, which system shall use such amount or amounts for\\nthe payment of the county or city share of its operating expenses as\\ndetermined by the legislature or by the formula or formulae developed by\\nthe commissioner. When such amount or amounts are received by such\\npublic transportation system, it shall credit such amounts against any\\namounts due and owing such system by the county or city on whose account\\nsuch amount was withheld and paid.\\n  5. Any federal financial assistance granted for the specific purpose\\nof paying the operating expenses of any county, city or public benefit\\ncorporation eligible to receive service payments as a public\\ntransportation system pursuant to this section, received by the state or\\nany municipality after the effective date of this section, and made\\navailable to any such county, city or public benefit corporation for\\napplication in accordance with the terms of the grant, shall be combined\\nwith any similar federal grant made directly to the county, city or\\npublic benefit corporation to help meet the operating expenses of any\\nmass transportation services provided for by any such county, city or\\npublic benefit corporation whether directly or by contract. In the event\\nthat the total revenues of any public transportation system, including\\nsubsidies from federal, state or local governments, exceed the total\\noperating expenses for any such system, excluding depreciation, such\\nexcess shall be utilized by the system to reduce fares or to extend or\\nincrease mass transportation services. A plan to effectuate any such\\nfare reduction or extension or increase in services shall be submitted\\nto the commissioner by a public transportation system within thirty days\\nof receiving notice from the commissioner to prepare and submit such a\\nplan. Upon approval by the commissioner, such plan with any\\nmodifications made by the commissioner shall be implemented as soon as\\npractical. Upon the failure of a public transportation system to submit\\na plan in the manner provided by this subdivision, the surplus shall be\\nutilized by such system to reduce the proportionate shares of the state\\nand the county or city required to make matching payments to the system,\\nor in the event that no future payments are to be made to such public\\ntransportation system, the system shall proportionately refund such\\nsurplus to the state and the county or city involved.\\n  6. The commissioner may prescribe such regulations as he may deem\\nappropriate to effectuate the purposes of this section, including, but\\nnot limited to, a uniform system of accounting for the purposes of\\nreporting pursuant to the provisions of this section. The commissioner\\nshall also define by rules and regulations, the terms \"passenger\",\\n\"vehicle or car mile\", \"the urban area served by any such public\\ntransportation system\", \"passenger-mile\", \"chief executive officer\",\\n\"mass transportation services\", and \"service payment\", and such other\\nterms as he deems necessary to carry out the statewide operating\\nassistance program.\\n  7. The commissioner shall have the power to audit and examine the\\naccounts, books, contracts, records, documents and papers of any\\nparticipating public transportation system in order to effectuate the\\npurposes and intent of this section.\\n  8. The commissioner is hereby authorized to enter into contracts or\\notherwise cooperate with the federal government or any agency or\\ninstrumentality thereof for the purposes set forth in this section. Such\\nauthorization shall include the power to apply for, receive, distribute\\nor expend federal money available or which may hereafter become\\navailable for such purposes.

Statewide mass transportation operating assistance program. 1.\\nWithin the amounts made available therefor by appropriation, a statewide\\nmass transportation operating assistance program is hereby established\\nfor the purpose of making payments toward the operating expenses of\\npublic transportation systems. For the purposes of this section, the\\nterm public transportation system shall mean any public benefit\\ncorportion constituting a transportation authority which provides or\\ncontracts for the provision of (under joint support arrangements) mass\\ntransportation services, or a subsidiary thereof, or any Indian tribe\\nwhich provides or any county or city which provides or contracts for the\\nprovision of (pursuant to section one hundred nineteen-r of the general\\nmunicipal law) mass transportation services or any person, firm or\\ncorporation performing intercity bus passenger service as defined in\\nsubdivision three of section fourteen-g of this article serving two or\\nmore counties within the state which is under contract with the\\ncommissioner pursuant to such section fourteen-g to provide mass\\ntransportation services.\\n  2. a. The commissioner shall pay to each public transportation system\\nthat makes an application therefor, in quarterly installments, a mass\\ntransportation operating assistance service payment. For the purposes of\\nthis section, the quarters shall be April through June, July through\\nSeptember, October through December and January through March.\\n  b. For the quarter commencing April first, nineteen hundred\\nseventy-five the quarterly service payment shall be the amount computed\\nby the formula set forth in subsection three of this section.\\n  3. The quarterly service payment made to any public transportation\\nsystem shall not be greater than a sum computed in one of the following\\nmanners:\\n  (i) In the case of commuter rail, by adding the certified number of\\ncommuter rail passengers multiplied by two cents per passenger and the\\ncertified number of commuter rail vehicle or car miles multiplied by\\ntwenty-five cents per vehicle or car mile.\\n  (ii) In the case of subway or rapid transit, by adding the certified\\nnumber of subway or rapid transit passengers multiplied by two cents per\\npassenger and the certified numbers of subway or rapid transit vehicle\\nor car miles multiplied by eight cents per vehicle or car mile.\\n  (iii) In the case of bus lines, by adding the certified number of bus\\npassengers multiplied by two cents per passenger and the certified\\nnumber of bus miles multiplied by seven cents per bus mile. For the\\npurposes of computing quarterly service payments only mileage\\naccumulated in revenue service shall be used.\\n  Whenever it is determined by the commissioner that the amount of money\\nappropriated for service payments is less than the total amount of money\\nfor which all public transportation systems are eligible, the\\ncommissioner may establish on a quarterly or annual basis, a maximum\\nservice payment limit which is lower than that provided for in this\\nsection.\\n  (iv) In the case of commuter ferry lines with the authorization for\\npayment thereof for the fiscal year nineteen hundred\\nseventy-five--nineteen hundred seventy-six to be in the discretion of\\nthe commissioner, by adding the certified number of annual ferry\\npassengers multiplied by two cents per passenger, times the certified\\nnumber of annual nautical ferry miles, times two-one hundred\\nthousandths. For the purposes of computing quarterly service payments\\nonly mileage accumulated in revenue service shall be used.\\n  4. a. All service payments shall be made upon an application of the\\npublic transportation system. Such application shall be filed between\\nthe second and the seventeenth day of the first month of each quarter.\\nUpon application, the chief executive officer of each public\\ntransportation system shall certify to the commissioner, the total\\nnumber of passengers such system estimates that it will carry and the\\ntotal number of vehicle or car miles such system estimates that its\\nequipment will travel in revenue service during the quarter for which\\nsuch installment is to be paid.\\n  Upon receipt and approval of such application and certifications the\\ncommissioner shall, by the tenth day of the next succeeding month, pay\\nto the public transportation operator, the quarterly service payment.\\n  b. The chief executive officer of each public transportation system\\nreceiving a quarterly service payment pursuant to this section shall\\ncertify to the commissioner, within fifteen days after the end of the\\nquarter for which a service payment was received, the actual total\\nnumber of passengers carried by the system during such quarter and the\\nactual total vehicle or car miles the system's equipment traveled in\\nrevenue service during such quarter, and based upon such actual totals,\\nthe commissioner shall make such adjustments as may be appropriate in\\nthe amount of the service payment for such system for the succeeding\\nquarter.\\n  5. a. For each quarter, each county, municipality or Indian tribe\\nserved by a public transportation system which receives a service\\npayment pursuant to subsection two of this section shall, not later than\\nthe twenty-fifth day of the second month of each quarter for which\\npayment is made, pay to the public transportation system a sum equal to\\nsuch service payment or its share of such service payment, except that\\nin the case of a service payment made to a public transportation system\\non account of mass transportation services provided to more than one\\ncounty (considering the city of New York to be one county), each county\\nreceiving such services from such system shall pay to the system a sum\\nequal to its share of the service payment, which sum shall be determined\\nin accordance with the percentage or dollar amounts established for such\\ncounty by the legislature.\\n  Where such county, municipality or Indian tribe is the public\\ntransportation system, sums equal to such service payment shall be\\ncommitted to the use of the public transportation system, not later than\\nthe twenty-fifty day of the second month of each quarter. Such sums so\\ncommitted shall not be used for other than the purposes of operating the\\npublic transportation system.\\n  b. The payment or commitment of such sums by the counties,\\nmunicipalities or Indian tribes provided for in paragraph a of this\\nsubdivision shall not be made from sums received in payment of fares by\\nthe passengers of such public transportation system or from any other\\nrevenues of such system.\\n  c. In the event that a county or municipality shall fail to make to a\\npublic transportation system any of the payments required to be made by\\nit under this section, the chief executive officer of the public\\ntransportation system or such other person as the commissioner shall\\ndesignate shall certify to the state comptroller such amount due and\\nowing such public transportation system and the state comptroller shall\\nwithhold an equivalent amount from state aid allocated to such county or\\nmunicipality from highway aid, the motor fuel tax and the motor vehicle\\nregistration fee distributed pursuant to section one hundred twelve of\\nthe highway law, or per capita local assistance pursuant to section\\nfifty-four of the state finance law subject to the following\\nlimitations: prior to withholding amounts allocated to carry such county\\nor municipality, the comptroller shall pay in full any amount due the\\nstate of New York municipal bond bank agency, on account of any such\\ncounty or municipality's obligation to such agency; the city university\\nconstruction fund, pursuant to the provisions of the city university\\nconstruction fund act; the New York city housing development\\ncorporation, pursuant to the provisions of the New York city housing\\ndevelopment corporation act (article twelve of the private housing\\nfinance law); and the transit construction fund, pursuant to the\\nprovisions of article five, title nine-a of the public authorities law.\\nThe comptroller shall give the director of the budget notification of\\nany such payment. Such amount or amounts so withheld by the state\\ncomptroller shall be paid to such public transportation system, which\\nsystem shall use such amount or amounts for the payment of the county or\\nmunicipality share of its operating expenses. When such amount or\\namounts are received by such public transportation system, it shall\\ncredit such amounts against any amounts due and owing such system by the\\ncounty or municipality on whose account such amount was withheld and\\npaid.\\n  d. The commissioner may impose a penalty in an amount not exceeding\\ntwenty per centum of any overpayment to a public transportation system\\nwhenever such overpayment results from willful failure to comply with\\nthe requirements of this section, or the rules and regulations\\nauthorized by this section, or whenever a public transportation system,\\nor an individual operator that is a part of such system, knowingly files\\nan incomplete, incorrect or misstated report. A public transportation\\nsystem or individual operator may request and the commissioner shall\\nprovide an opportunity to be heard prior to the imposition of any\\npenalty as provided for in this section.\\n  6. Any federal financial assistance granted for the specific purpose\\nof paying the operating expenses of any county, municipality, public\\nbenefit corporation or Indian tribe, eligible to receive service\\npayments as a public transportation system pursuant to this section,\\nreceived by the state or any municipality or Indian tribe after the\\neffective date of this section, and made available to any such county,\\nmunicipality, public benefit corporation or Indian tribe for application\\nin accordance with the terms of the grant, shall be combined with any\\nsimilar federal grant made directly to the county, municipality, public\\nbenefit corporation or Indian tribe to help meet the operating expenses\\nof any mass transportation services provided for by any such county,\\nmunicipality, public benefit corporation or Indian tribe whether\\ndirectly or by contract. In the event that the total revenues of any\\npublic transportation system, including subsidies from federal, state or\\nlocal governments, and where applicable, including funds required to be\\ncommitted by the county, municipality or Indian tribe, exceed the total\\noperating expenses for any such system, excluding depreciation, such\\nexcess shall be utilized by the system to reduce fares or to extend or\\nincrease mass transportation services. A plan to effectuate any such\\nfare reduction or extension or increase in services shall be submitted\\nto the commissioner by a public transportation system within thirty days\\nof receiving notice from the commissioner to prepare and submit such a\\nplan. Upon approval by the commissioner, such plan with any\\nmodifications made by the commissioner shall be implemented as soon as\\npractical. Upon the failure of a public transportation system to submit\\na plan in the manner provided by this section, the surplus shall be\\nutilized by such system to reduce the proportionate shares of the state\\nand the county, municipality or Indian tribe required to make matching\\npayments to the system, or in the event that no future payments are to\\nbe made to such public transportation system, the system shall\\nproportionately refund such surplus to the state and the county,\\nmunicipality or Indian tribe involved.\\n  7. The commissioner may prescribe such regulations as he may deem\\nappropriate to effectuate the purposes of this section, including but\\nnot limited to, a uniform system of reporting pursuant to the provisions\\nof this section. The commissioner shall also define by rules and\\nregulations, the terms \"passenger\", \"vehicle or car mile\", \"urbanized\\narea\", \"chief executive officer\", \"mass transportation services\",\\n\"service payment\", \"commuter rail system\", \"subway system\", \"rapid\\ntransit system\", \"bus system\", \"peak hours\", \"elderly\", \"handicapped\",\\nand such other terms as he deems necessary for the purposes of this\\nsection.\\n  The commissioner, in conformance with the auditing procedures of the\\nstate comptroller, shall have the power to audit and examine the\\naccounts, books, contracts, records, documents and papers of any\\nparticipating public transportation system in order to effectuate the\\npurposes and intent of this section. Where a county, counties,\\nmunicipality, municipalities, Indian tribe or Indian tribes contract for\\nthe provision of public transportation services with a private operator,\\nthe books and records of such private operator shall also be subject to\\naudit and examination by the commissioner.\\n  8. The commissioner is hereby authorized to enter into contracts or\\notherwise cooperate with the federal government or any agency or\\ninstrumentality thereof for the purposes set forth in this section. Such\\nauthorization shall include the power to apply for, receive, distribute\\nor, following appropriation authorization by the legislature, expend\\nfederal money available or which may hereafter become available for such\\npurposes. The distribution of federal monies shall be in accordance with\\nthe requirements of the federal grant, except that in the absence of any\\nrequired distribution the commissioner shall distribute such federal\\nmonies in a manner which gives due consideration to the relative needs\\nof public transportation system operators throughout the state.\\n  9. The commissioner shall prepare and submit to the governor and the\\nlegislature on or before November fifteenth of each year, a report,\\nwhich may include, but not be limited to, findings and recommendations\\non the following: (a) the impact and effectiveness of the statewide\\noperating assistance program; (b) the current and projected operating\\ncosts, revenues and subsidies of major transit systems or groups of\\nsystems; (c) the efficiency, effectiveness, quality and the availability\\nof transit service; (d) the status of transit system long-range planning\\nand development and use of service and performance guidelines to\\nevaluate the efficiency, effectiveness and quality of service; and (e)\\nissues related to and/or affecting the administration of the statewide\\noperating assistance program.\\n  * 10. Any street surface railroad in a city having a population of one\\nmillion or more commencing operation after July first, nineteen hundred\\nninety-three shall not be eligible to receive statewide mass\\ntransportation operating assistance.\\n  * NB There are 2 sb 10's\\n  * 10. Any commuter ferry line commencing operation after July first,\\nnineteen hundred ninety-three shall not be eligible to receive statewide\\nmass transportation operating assistance.\\n  * NB There are 2 sb 10's\\n  11. To ensure that major private bus operations, as defined by the\\ncommissioner, do not make excess profits, the commissioner shall limit\\noperating assistance provided pursuant to this section to an amount\\nwhich will not provide more than a reasonable return based on equity or\\noperating revenue and expenses as defined by program rules and\\nregulations. Further, the commissioner may exempt the following from the\\nprovisions of this subdivision:\\n  a. operations of private carriers that are conducted pursuant to\\ncontracts with New York state;\\n  b. operations of private carriers that are conducted pursuant to\\ncompetitively procured contracts awarded by municipalities; and\\n  c. complementary para-transit operations that are provided as mandated\\nby the federal Americans with Disabilities Act.\\n  12. To ensure that mass transportation operating assistance is not\\nused to support duplicative and redundant service, the commissioner may\\nlimit or withhold statewide mass transportation operating assistance\\nfrom any public transportation system for such services the commissioner\\ndetermines to be duplicative or redundant. Prior to determining that a\\nservice is or would be duplicative or redundant, the commissioner shall\\nconsult with the provider of such service or the applicant proposing to\\nprovide such service and with any authority, Indian tribe, county or\\ncity which is contracting for such service or proposing to contract for\\nsuch service.\\n",

Before adopting such rules and\\nregulations, the regional planning board shall consult with the\\ndepartment of state, which may make recommendations concerning such\\nstandards and procedures.  In the event a proposed project is to be\\nlocated, in whole or in part, in an area not within the jurisdiction of\\na multi-county regional planning board which has adopted a comprehensive\\nregional plan, the functions, powers and duties conferred in this\\nsection upon such a regional planning board shall apply to the county\\nplanning board or boards of any county wherein such project is to be\\nlocated, in whole or in part, if such county planning board has adopted\\na comprehensive master plan. In the event there is no such county\\nplanning board which had adopted a comprehensive master plan, such\\nfunctions, powers and duties may be carried out by the department of\\nstate.\\n  The regional comprehensive plan referred to under this section shall\\nembody the policy recommendations of the regional planning board for the\\ncomprehensive development of the region, and shall include statements of\\npolicies, goals and objectives. Before such regional comprehensive plan\\nis adopted by the regional planning board, it shall be certified to by\\nthe secretary of state as being adequate for the review purposes of this\\nsection. The comprehensive master plan of a county referred to under\\nthis section shall embody the same elements as herein prescribed with\\nrespect to a regional comprehensive plan, and shall similarly be\\ncertified to by the secretary of state.\\n",

Such\\napplication shall be in the form of a petition setting forth grounds,\\nincluding that the cooperation by petitioner with the grand jury at the\\ntime of the refusal was such, and the amount and degree of control and\\nfinancial interest, if any, in the petitioning firm, partnership or\\ncorporation by the member, partner, officer or director who refused to\\nwaive immunity is such that it will not be in the public interest to\\ncancel or terminate petitioner's contracts or subcontracts or to\\ncontinue the disqualification, as provided in subdivisions two and three\\nof this section.\\n  A copy of the petition and accompanying papers shall be served with\\nthe notices to be given pursuant to this subdivision.\\n  (b) Upon the filing of such petition the court may stay as to\\npetitioner, pending a decision upon the petition, the cancellation or\\ntermination of any contracts or subcontracts resulting from such refusal\\nupon such terms as to notice or otherwise as may be just.\\n  (c) At least two days prior to the return day, the officer who\\nconducted the investigation before the grand jury and the attorney\\ngeneral may file answers to the petition or apply for an order\\ndismissing the petition as a matter of law. On or before the return day\\nthe petitioner may file a reply to the answer.\\n  (d) Upon the return day the court may, upon the petition and answer\\nand other papers filed, forthwith render such final order as the case\\nrequires, or if a triable issue of fact is duly raised, it shall\\nforthwith be tried before a court sitting without a jury or before a\\nreferee. The provisions of statute or rule governing references in an\\naction shall apply to a reference under this subdivision.\\n  (e) The court shall render a final order dismissing the petition on\\nthe merits or discontinuing the disqualification upon the ground that\\nthe public interest would be served by its discontinuance, and granting\\nsuch other relief as to the cancellation or termination of contracts or\\nsubcontracts as may be appropriate, but without costs to petitioner.\\n  5.

The legislature hereby\\nfinds, determines, and declares that:\\n  1. the inability of persons in rural areas to access public or private\\ntransportation services often is detrimental to the public health,\\nsafety and general welfare because such persons are thereby unable to\\nreceive regular medical care and public services, do shopping,\\nparticipate in specialized recreation and education programs, and obtain\\nemployment;\\n  2. the number and proportion of persons without access to essential\\ntransportation services in rural environs is alarmingly high and could\\nincrease in the future, thereby further increasing the demand for\\nspecialized transportation services in said areas;\\n  3. added social burdens frequently fall upon state and local\\ngovernments because of involuntary isolation of individuals and families\\nin rural areas who are unable to obtain employment, public services,\\nhealth care, educational or other essential human services;\\n  4. lack of a comprehensive state policy to promote the development of\\ncoordinated public transportation services in the state's rural regions\\nhas inhibited the formation of such services, thereby contributing to a\\ngreat disparity in the nature and levels of transportation services\\navailable in said rural areas and the inefficient use of many existing\\ntransportation resources;\\n  5. such unique rural conditions as low population density, limitations\\nof size and resources and the general absence of private common carriers\\ncall for more innovation and flexibility in the development of\\ncoordinated public transportation services in rural environs, which\\nwould include more intensive use of existing transportation services\\nthat may now service a single clientele and are frequently\\nunderutilized;\\n  6. existing federal, state and local public transportation assistance\\nprograms are of vital importance in providing mobility to persons in\\nrural areas of New York state, and increased coordination and more\\nintensive use of such programs would or could increase the\\ncost-effectiveness of these programs and enhance the availability of\\ntransportation services to those individuals and families in need; and\\n  7. the establishment of a rural public transportation coordination\\nassistance program would or could increase the mobility of individuals\\nand families in the state's rural regions and make available to those in\\nneed more of the limited transportation resources that now exist.\\n  8. the establishment of a rural transportation coordination assistance\\nprogram is intended to be in addition to existing programs and services\\nrequired of the department of transportation and this act shall in no\\nmanner or means detract from the other services, resources and programs\\nnow provided by such department.\\n",

Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the commissioner shall\\nnot have jurisdiction over the regulation of any bus line operations\\nthat are wholly within the boundaries of any city when such city has\\nadopted an ordinance, local law or charter to regulate or franchise bus\\nline operations, except that the commissioner shall have jurisdiction\\nwith respect to safety of operation of motor vehicles and self-insurance\\nrequirements of such bus lines. The commissioner shall, however, have\\nexclusive jurisdiction over the regulation of common carriers of\\npassengers by motor vehicle that provide operations on a prearranged\\nbasis over non-specified or irregular routes within a city, except as\\nprovided in subdivision five of this section or as otherwise provided in\\nthis chapter.

Such local law or ordinance may provide\\nthat notices of violation of such local law or ordinance may be served\\nby any police officer, officer or employee designated by the city agency\\nwith regulatory responsibility, or authorized officers or employees of\\nthe transit authority of such city, and shall be returnable to such\\nagency or administrative tribunal. Such local law or ordinance shall\\nprovide that the civil penalty imposed by such agency or administrative\\ntribunal for a first violation relating to a van service or other such\\ncommon carrier of passengers shall not be more than one thousand\\ndollars, and for a second or subsequent violation within two years of\\nthe first violation shall not be more than twenty-five hundred dollars.\\nJudgments based on such adjudications may be entered and enforced\\nwithout court proceedings in accordance with the provisions of such\\ncharter pertaining to the enforcement of judgments relating to for-hire\\nvehicles.\\n  (4) Such local law or ordinance shall provide that where such agency\\nor administrative tribunal finds an owner liable for operating a vehicle\\nas a van service or other such common carrier without the operating\\nauthority required by such local law or ordinance, such agency or\\nadministrative tribunal may notify the commissioner of motor vehicles of\\nsuch finding and the commissioner shall thereupon suspend the\\nregistration of such vehicle and shall deny any application for the\\nregistration of such vehicle or any application for the renewal thereof\\npursuant to subdivision five-a of section four hundred one of the\\nvehicle and traffic law until such time as such agency or administrative\\ntribunal may give notice that the violation has been corrected to its\\nsatisfaction. The procedure on any such suspension shall be the same as\\nin the case of a suspension under the vehicle and traffic law. Operation\\nof any motor vehicle for which the registration has been suspended as\\nherein provided shall constitute a class A misdemeanor.\\n  (5) Such local law or ordinance may provide for the seizure and\\nforfeiture of vehicles that have been operated as a van service or other\\nsuch common carrier of passengers without the operating authority\\nrequired by such local law or ordinance, in accordance with the\\nprovisions of paragraphs b and c of this subdivision.\\n  b. (1) A local law or ordinance adopted pursuant to paragraph a of\\nthis subdivision may provide that any police officer or officer or\\nemployee designated by the city agency with regulatory responsibility\\nmay, upon service of a notice of violation upon the owner or operator of\\na vehicle, seize a vehicle which such police officer or authorized\\nofficer or employee has reasonable cause to believe is being operated as\\na van service or other such common carrier of passengers by or on behalf\\nof an individual or entity which is not the holder of operating\\nauthority to operate a van service or other such common carrier of\\npassengers. All passengers in any seized vehicle shall be left in or\\ntransported to a location which is readily accessible to other means of\\npublic transportation. Any vehicle seized pursuant to this paragraph\\nshall be delivered into the custody of the city agency with regulatory\\nresponsibility or other appropriate agency of the city. Within one\\nbusiness day after the seizure, notice of such seizure and a copy of the\\nnotice of violation shall be mailed to the owner of such vehicle at the\\naddress for such owner set forth in the records maintained by the\\ndepartment of motor vehicles, or for vehicles not registered in New York\\nstate, such equivalent record in such state of registration.\\n  (2) A hearing to adjudicate the violation underlying the seizure shall\\nbe held before the agency or administrative tribunal designated by such\\nlocal law or ordinance to adjudicate violations of such local law or\\nordinance within five business days after the date of seizure. Such\\nagency or administrative tribunal shall within one business day of the\\nconclusion of the hearing render a determination as to whether the\\nvehicle has been operated by or on behalf of an individual or entity\\nwhich is not the holder of operating authority to operate a van service\\nor other such common carrier of passengers. An owner shall be eligible\\nto obtain release of such vehicle prior to such hearing if such owner\\nhas not previously been found liable in an administrative or court\\nproceeding for operating a vehicle as a van service or other such common\\ncarrier in violation of a local law or ordinance adopted pursuant to\\nparagraph a of this subdivision, which violation was committed within a\\nfive-year period prior to the violation resulting in seizure. The\\nvehicle shall be released to an eligible owner upon the posting of a\\nbond in a form satisfactory to such agency or administrative tribunal in\\nan amount that shall not exceed an amount sufficient to cover the\\nmaximum fines or civil penalties which may be imposed for the violation\\nunderlying the seizure and all reasonable costs for removal and storage\\nof such vehicle.\\n  (3) Where such agency or administrative tribunal after adjudication of\\nthe violation underlying the seizure finds that the vehicle has been\\noperated by or on behalf of an individual or entity which is not the\\nholder of operating authority to operate a van service or other such\\ncommon carrier of passengers, (i) if the vehicle is not subject to\\nforfeiture pursuant to paragraph c of this subdivision, such agency or\\nadministrative tribunal shall release such vehicle to an owner upon\\npayment of the applicable fines and civil penalties and all reasonable\\nremoval and storage costs, or (ii) if the vehicle is subject to\\nforfeiture pursuant to paragraph c of this subdivision, such agency or\\nadministrative tribunal may release such vehicle to an owner upon\\npayment of the applicable fines and civil penalties and all reasonable\\nremoval and storage costs, or may commence a forfeiture action pursuant\\nto paragraph c of this subdivision within ten days after the owner's\\nwritten demand for such vehicle.\\n  (4) Where such agency or administrative tribunal after adjudication of\\nthe violation underlying the seizure finds that the charge of operating\\nwithout the required operating authority has not been sustained, the\\nvehicle shall be released to the owner.\\n  (5) If an owner or representative of such owner has not sought to\\nreclaim a seized vehicle within thirty days after the mailing of notice\\nto such owner of the final adjudication by such city agency or\\nadministrative tribunal of the violation underlying the seizure, such\\nvehicle shall be deemed by such agency or administrative tribunal to be\\nabandoned. Such vehicle shall be disposed of by the city agency with\\nregulatory responsibility or other appropriate agency of the city\\npursuant to section twelve hundred twenty-four of the vehicle and\\ntraffic law; provided, however, that notwithstanding any inconsistent\\nprovision of section twelve hundred twenty-four of such law, if an owner\\nseeks to reclaim such vehicle pursuant to the provisions of section\\ntwelve hundred twenty-four of such law, such owner shall be deemed to\\nhave made a written demand for such vehicle and such agency or\\nadministrative tribunal shall take such action as may be authorized by\\nsubparagraph three or four of this paragraph.\\n  c. (1) In addition to the penalties, sanctions and remedies provided\\nfor in paragraphs a and b of this subdivision or subdivisions six and\\nseven of section one hundred forty-five of this chapter, a vehicle\\nseized pursuant to paragraph b of this subdivision and all rights, title\\nand interest therein shall be subject to forfeiture to the city in\\naccordance with the procedures set forth in this paragraph upon judicial\\ndetermination thereof if the owner of such vehicle has been found liable\\nat least two times in an administrative or court proceeding for\\nviolating a provision of a local law or ordinance adopted pursuant to\\nparagraph a of this subdivision that prohibits the operation of a\\nvehicle as a van service or other such common carrier of passengers\\nwithout the operating authority required by such local law or ordinance,\\nboth of which violations were committed within a five-year period.\\n  (2) A forfeiture action which is commenced pursuant to this paragraph\\nshall be commenced by filing of a summons with notice or a summons and\\ncomplaint pursuant to the civil practice law and rules, and such summons\\nwith notice or summons and complaint shall be served pursuant to\\nsubparagraph three of this paragraph. A vehicle which is the subject of\\nsuch action shall remain in the custody of the city agency with\\nregulatory responsibility or other appropriate agency of the city\\npending the final determination of the forfeiture action.\\n  (3) Service of a summons with notice or a summons and complaint shall\\nbe made: (i) by personal service pursuant to the civil practice law and\\nrules upon all owners of the vehicle listed in the records maintained by\\nthe department of motor vehicles, or for vehicles not registered in New\\nYork state, in the records maintained by the state of registration; (ii)\\nby first class mail upon all individuals who have notified such city\\nagency or administrative tribunal that they are an owner of the vehicle;\\nand (iii) by first class mail upon all persons holding a security\\ninterest in such vehicle which security interest has been filed with the\\ndepartment of motor vehicles pursuant to the provisions of title ten of\\nthe vehicle and traffic law, at the address set forth in the records of\\nsuch department, or for vehicles not registered in New York state, all\\npersons holding a security interest in such vehicle which security\\ninterest has been filed with such state of registration at the address\\nprovided by such state of registration.\\n  (4) Any owner who receives notice of the institution of a forfeiture\\naction who claims an interest in the vehicle subject to forfeiture shall\\nassert a claim for the recovery of the vehicle or satisfaction of the\\nowner's interest in such vehicle by intervening in the forfeiture action\\nin accordance with the civil practice law and rules. Any person with a\\nsecurity interest in such vehicle who receives notice of the institution\\nof the forfeiture action who claims an interest in such vehicle subject\\nto forfeiture shall assert a claim for satisfaction of such person's\\nsecurity interest in such vehicle by intervening in the forfeiture\\naction in accordance with the civil practice law and rules.\\n  (5) No vehicle shall be forfeited under this paragraph, to the extent\\nof the interest of a person who claims an interest in the vehicle, where\\nsuch person pleads and proves as an affirmative defense that: (i) the\\nuse of the vehicle for the conduct that was the basis for a seizure\\nauthorized by a local law or ordinance adopted pursuant to paragraph a\\nof this subdivision occurred without the knowledge of such person, or if\\nsuch person had knowledge of such use, without the consent of such\\nperson, and that such person did not knowingly obtain such interest in\\nthe vehicle in order to avoid the forfeiture of such vehicle; or (ii)\\nthe conduct that was the basis for such seizure was committed by any\\nperson other than such person claiming an interest in the vehicle, while\\nsuch vehicle was unlawfully in the possession of a person who acquired\\npossession thereof in violation of the criminal laws of the United\\nStates or any state. For purposes of this subparagraph, where such\\nperson claiming an interest in the vehicle had knowledge of the use of\\nthe vehicle for the conduct that was the basis for such seizure, such\\nperson shall be deemed to have consented to the unlawful conduct unless\\nsuch person establishes that he or she did all that could reasonably\\nhave been done to prevent the use of the vehicle for such unlawful\\nconduct.\\n  (6) The agency of the city having custody of the forfeited vehicle,\\nafter judicial determination of forfeiture, shall, at its discretion,\\neither: (i) retain such vehicle for the official use of the city or,\\n(ii) by public notice of at least twenty days, sell such forfeited\\nvehicle at public sale. The net proceeds of any such sale shall be paid\\ninto the general fund of such city.\\n  (7) At any time within six months after the forfeiture, any person\\nclaiming an interest in a vehicle which has been forfeited pursuant to\\nthis paragraph who was not sent notice of the commencement of the\\nforfeiture action pursuant to subparagraph three of this paragraph or\\nwho did not otherwise receive actual notice of the forfeiture action may\\nassert in an action commenced before the justice of the supreme court\\nbefore whom the forfeiture action was held such claim as could have been\\nasserted in such forfeiture action pursuant to this paragraph. The court\\nmay grant the relief sought upon such terms and conditions as it deems\\nreasonable and just if such person claiming an interest in the vehicle\\nestablishes that he or she was not sent notice of the commencement of\\nthe forfeiture action and was without actual knowledge of the forfeiture\\naction and establishes either of the affirmative defenses set forth in\\nsubparagraph five of this paragraph.\\n  (8) In any action commenced pursuant to subparagraph two or seven of\\nthis paragraph, where the court awards a sum of money to one or more\\npersons in satisfaction of such person's or persons' interest or\\ninterests in the forfeited vehicle, the total amount awarded to satisfy\\nsuch interest or interests shall not exceed the amount of the net\\nproceeds of the sale of the forfeited vehicle, after deduction of the\\nlawful expenses incurred by the city, including the reasonable costs of\\nremoval and storage of the vehicle between the time of seizure and the\\ndate of sale.\\n  (9) For purposes of this paragraph, the term \"security interest\" shall\\nmean a security interest as defined in subdivision k of section two\\nthousand one hundred one of the vehicle and traffic law.\\n  d. For purposes of this subdivision, the term \"owner\" shall mean an\\nowner as defined in section one hundred twenty-eight and in subdivision\\nthree of section three hundred eighty-eight of the vehicle and traffic\\nlaw.\\n  e. The provisions of this subdivision authorizing penalties, sanctions\\nand remedies shall not be construed to supersede the provisions of\\nsubdivisions six and seven of section one hundred forty-five of this\\nchapter but shall be construed to provide penalties, sanctions and\\nremedies in addition to those provided in such subdivisions.\\n  f. Any city with a population of over one million which adopts a local\\nlaw or ordinance pursuant to this subdivision to regulate van service\\nand other such common carrier operations shall, no later than two years\\nfollowing the effective date of such local law or ordinance, submit a\\nreport regarding the regulation of such van services and other such\\ncommon carriers to the governor, the temporary president of the senate\\nand the speaker of the assembly. Such report shall, to the extent such\\ninformation is available, include but not be limited to: (i) the\\nestimated number of individuals and entities with proper operating\\nauthority to operate a van service and other such common carrier, both\\nprior to the commencement of local regulation and after such two-year\\nperiod, and the number of vehicles operated by such individuals or\\nentities; (ii) the estimated number of vehicles operated without proper\\noperating authority, both prior to the commencement of local regulation\\nand after such two-year period; (iii) the number of individuals and\\nentities which had applied for operating authority during such two-year\\nperiod; (iv) the number of applications which had been denied and a\\nbreakdown of the reasons for such denials; (v) the number of notices of\\nviolations or summonses issued to vehicles pursuant to local law or\\nordinance during such two-year period, and a breakdown of the\\ndispositions of such violation notices or summonses; (vi) the number of\\nvehicles seized pursuant to local law or ordinance during such two-year\\nperiod, and a breakdown of the dispositions of such seizures; (vii) the\\nnumber of vehicles forfeited pursuant to local law or ordinance during\\nsuch two-year period; (viii) the total amount of fines collected\\npursuant to such local law or ordinance; and (ix) a description of the\\nmanner in which service is being provided to commuters who previously\\nused van services and other such common carriers which had been\\noperating without proper operating authority.\\n",

If, however, the charges contained in such petition be\\nnot thus satisfied, and it shall appear to the commissioner that there\\nare reasonable grounds therefor, he shall investigate such charges in\\nsuch manner and by such means as he shall deem proper, and take such\\naction within his powers as the facts justify.\\n  3. Whenever the commissioner shall investigate any matter complained\\nof by any person or corporation aggrieved by any act or omission of a\\ncommon carrier under this section it shall be his duty to make and file\\nan order either dismissing the petition or complaint or directing the\\ncommon carrier complained of to satisfy the cause of complaint in whole\\nor to the extent which the commissioner may specify and require.\\n",

and the commissioner may give to the\\nhearing and decision of such questions preference over all other\\nquestions pending before him and decide the same as speedily as\\npossible.\\n  Whenever the commissioner shall find, after a hearing had upon his own\\nmotion, or upon a complaint, that the rates, fares or charges demanded,\\nexacted, charged or collected by any common carrier subject to his\\njurisdiction for excursion, school or family commutation, commutation\\npassenger tickets, half fare tickets for the transportation of children\\nunder six years of age, or any other form of reduced rate tickets for\\nthe transportation of persons within the state, or joint interchangeable\\nmileage tickets, with special privileges as to the amount of free\\nbaggage that may be carried under mileage tickets of one thousand miles\\nor more within the state, or that the regulations or practices of such\\ncommon carriers affecting such rates are unjust, unreasonable, unjustly\\ndiscriminatory or unduly preferential, or in violation of law, or that\\nthe maximum rates, fares or charges collected or charged for any of such\\nforms of reduced fare passenger transportation tickets by any such\\ncommon carrier are insufficient to yield reasonable compensation for the\\nservice rendered, and are unjust and unreasonable, and whenever the\\ncommissioner shall find, after a hearing had upon his own motion or upon\\na complaint, and upon investigation, that the sale of any form or forms\\nof reduced passenger ticket heretofore sold or used upon any railroad or\\nstreet railroad within the state, the use or sale of which ticket or\\ntickets has been discontinued within five years prior to June thirtieth,\\nnineteen hundred and eleven, will be just and reasonable and not in\\nviolation of any provision of this chapter or other provision of law,\\nthe commissioner shall, with due regard, among other things, to a\\nreasonable average return upon the value of the property actually used\\nin the public service and to the necessity of making reservation out of\\nincome for surplus and contingencies, determine the just and reasonable\\nrates, fares and charges to be thereafter observed and enforced as the\\nmaximum to be charged for such mileage, excursion, school or family\\ncommutation, commutation, half fare or any other form of reduced rate\\ntickets for the transportation of persons, or joint interchangeable\\nmileage tickets with special privileges as aforesaid, and shall order\\nthe sale and use thereof to be restored, or any of the kinds of tickets\\nherein specified or any other form of reduced rate ticket for the\\ntransportation of persons within the state, upon any railroad or street\\nrailroad within this state, upon which railroad or street railroad any\\nsuch form of ticket or tickets for the transportation of persons within\\nthe state, have, within five years prior to June thirtieth, nineteen\\nhundred and eleven, been sold or used, and shall determine and prescribe\\nthe reasonable and just rates, fares and charges to be thereafter\\nobserved and enforced as the maximum to be charged for any of such form\\nof ticket or tickets for the transportation of persons within the state,\\nall of which acts fixing such rates, fares and charges or requiring the\\nrestoration of, sale and use of any of such forms of ticket or tickets,\\nshall be by order to be served upon all common carriers, railroad\\ncompanies and street railroad companies by whom such rates, fares and\\ncharges or restoration of, sale or use of such ticket or tickets are\\nthereafter to be observed.\\n  2. Whenever the commissioner shall find, after a hearing, had upon his\\nown motion or upon complaint, that the regulations, practices,\\nequipment, appliances, or service of any such common carrier in respect\\nto transportation of persons or property within the state are unjust,\\nunreasonable, unsafe, improper or inadequate, the commissioner shall\\ndetermine the just, reasonable, safe, adequate and proper regulations,\\npractices, equipment, appliances and service thereafter to be in force,\\nto be observed and to be used in such transportation of persons and\\nproperty and so fix and prescribe the same by order to be served upon\\nevery common carrier to be bound thereby; and thereafter every common\\ncarrier shall observe and obey each and every requirement of every such\\norder so served upon it, and do everything necessary or proper in order\\nto secure absolute compliance with and observance of every such order by\\nall of its officers, agents and employees.\\n  3. The commissioner shall have power by order to require any two or\\nmore common carriers whose lines, owned, operated, controlled or leased,\\nform a continuous or connecting line of transportation or could be made\\nto do so by the construction and maintenance of switch connection or\\ninterchange track at connecting point, or by transfer of property or\\npassengers at connecting points, to establish through routes and joint\\nrates, fares and charges for the transportation of passengers and\\nproperty within the state as the commissioner may, by his order,\\ndesignate; and in case such through routes and joint rates be not\\nestablished by the common carriers named in any such order within the\\ntime therein specified, the commissioner shall establish just and\\nreasonable rates, fares and charges to be charged, for such through\\ntransportation, and declare the portion thereof to which each common\\ncarrier, affected thereby shall be entitled and the manner in which the\\nsame shall be paid and secured; and the commissioner shall also have\\npower in the same proceeding, or in a separate proceeding involving any\\nrates, fares or charges to prescribe joint rates and fares and charges\\nas the maximum to be exacted for the transportation by them of\\npassengers and property within the state, and to require such common\\ncarriers affected thereby to make within a specified time an agreement\\nbetween them as to the portion of such joint rates, fares or charges to\\nwhich each of them shall be entitled; and in case such agreement be not\\nso made within the time so specified the commissioner may declare by\\nsupplemental order the portion thereof to which each common carrier\\naffected thereby shall be entitled and the manner in which the same\\nshall be paid and secured; such supplemental order shall take effect as\\npart of the original order from the time such supplemental order shall\\nbecome effective.\\n  All powers of the commissioner to establish through routes and order\\njoint rates, fares and charges as above conferred in relation to common\\ncarriers by railroad, shall extend and apply to the establishment of\\nthrough routes and ordering of joint rates, fares and charges for use\\nand observance by common carriers by railroad and common carriers by\\nwater.\\n  When property may be or is transported from point to point in the\\nstate of New York by rail and water, the transportation being by a\\ncommon carrier or carriers, and entirely within such state, the\\ncommissioner shall have jurisdiction of such transportation and of the\\ncarriers, both by rail and by water, which may or do engage in the same,\\nin the following particulars, in addition to the jurisdiction given by\\nother provisions of this chapter:\\n  (a) To establish physical connection between the lines of the rail\\ncarrier and the dock of the water carrier by directing the rail carrier\\nto make suitable connection between its line and a track or tracks which\\nhave been constructed from the dock to the limits of its right of way,\\nor by directing either or both the rail and water carrier, individually\\nor in connection with one another, to construct and connect with the\\nlines of the rail carrier a spur track or tracks to the dock. This\\nprovision shall only apply where the connection is reasonably\\npracticable, can be made with safety to the public, and where the amount\\nof business existing or prospective is sufficient to justify the outlay.\\n  The commissioner shall have full authority to determine the terms and\\nconditions upon which these connecting tracks, when constructed, shall\\nbe operated, and he may either in the construction or the operation of\\nsuch tracks, determine what sum shall be paid to or by either carrier.\\nThe provisions of this paragraph shall extend to cases where the dock is\\nowned by other parties than the carrier involved.  The commissioner\\nshall have authority to compel common carriers by rail to make physical\\nconnection between their tracks and public terminals established and\\noperated by the state under the provisions of chapter seven hundred and\\nforty-six of the laws of nineteen hundred and eleven, at the expense of\\nsuch carrier and of the state in such proportions as may be reasonable,\\nwhere such connection is practicable. The commissioner shall also have\\nauthority to compel common carriers by rail to operate upon the railroad\\ntracks within such public terminals by such common carriers' own motive\\npower and servants all rolling stock going to or coming from such public\\nterminals. Common carriers by rail required to make such connections\\nshall file tariffs for all service into and out of such terminals and\\nover the connecting lines of such carriers by rail, if complaint is made\\nby any person that the rates so made are unreasonable, the burden shall\\nbe upon the common carrier by rail to establish the reasonableness of\\nsuch rates. If the rates are found by the commissioner to be\\nunreasonable, the commissioner shall establish reasonable rates. The use\\nand operation of such connections and the spotting, placing and removing\\nof rolling stock shall be in accordance with the regulations prescribed\\nby the commissioner.\\n  (b) To establish through routes and from time to time order maximum\\njoint rates between and over such rail and water lines, and to determine\\nall the terms and conditions under which such a line shall be operated\\nin the handling of the traffic embraced.\\n  (c) To establish maximum proportional rates by rail to and from places\\nto which the traffic is brought, or from which it is taken by the water\\ncarrier, and to determine to what traffic and upon what terms and\\nconditions such rates shall apply. By proportional rates are meant those\\nwhich differ from corresponding local rates to and from the place of\\nreceipt and delivery and which apply only to traffic which is brought to\\nthe place of receipt and delivery or is carried from that place by a\\ncommon carrier by water.\\n  (d) If any rail carrier subject to this chapter enters into\\narrangements with any water carrier operating in the state for the\\nhandling of business between interior points in said state, the\\ncommissioner may require such carrier to enter into similar arrangements\\nwith any or all other common carriers by water operating therein.\\n  (e) No common carrier by rail shall own, lease, operate, control or\\nhave any interest whatsoever, by stock ownership or otherwise, either\\ndirectly or indirectly, through any holding company, or by stockholders\\nor directors in common, or in any other manner, in any common carrier by\\nwater, with which said common carrier does or may compete for traffic,\\nor in vessels, boats or barges carrying freight upon any water route\\nwith which such common carrier does or may compete for traffic.\\n  Jurisdiction is hereby conferred on the commissioner to determine\\nquestions of fact as to the competition or possibility of competition,\\nafter full hearing, on the application of any railroad company or other\\ncarrier. Such application may be filed for the purpose of determining\\nwhether any existing service is in violation of this section and pray\\nfor an order permitting the continuance of any vessel or vessels already\\nin operation, or for the purpose of asking an order to install new\\nservice not in conflict with the provisions of this paragraph. The\\ncommissioner may on his own motion or the application of any shipper\\ninstitute proceedings to inquire into the operation of any vessel in use\\nby any railroad or other carrier which has not applied to the\\ncommissioner and had the question of competition or the possibility of\\ncompetition determined as herein provided.\\n  (f) The provisions of sections ninety-eight, ninety-nine and one\\nhundred, relating to filing, publication and changes of rates, fares and\\ncharges of common carriers shall apply to all rates, fares and charges,\\nand regulations and practices affecting rates, fares and charges for\\ntransportation partly by water and partly by railroad, when both the\\nwater line and the railroad line are used for a continuous carriage or\\nshipment; but the said section shall not apply to rates, fares or\\ncharges, or regulations or practices affecting rates, fares or charges,\\nestablished by any such common carrier by water for local carriage or\\nshipment of passengers or property between points in this state which\\nare served by such common carrier wholly by water and independently of\\nany railroad service.\\n  The provisions of this chapter, and the powers of the commissioner,\\nrelating to the transportation of passengers and property by railroad\\napply to the transportation of passengers and property partly by\\nrailroad and partly by water when both the railroad line and such water\\nline are used for a continuous carriage or shipment between points in\\nthis state; and the provisions of this chapter and the powers of the\\ncommissioner respecting common carriers by water are hereby limited\\nthereto, except as may be in this section otherwise specifically\\nprovided.\\n  4. If the commissioner shall be of the opinion that through cars for\\nthe transportation of property should be operated over the tracks of\\nsaid common carriers and that switch connection or interchange track at\\na connecting point, if not already existing, should be constructed and\\nmaintained by such common carriers, to the end that property may be\\ncarried without change of cars, the commissioner shall have power after\\na hearing to require by order said common carriers to receive from each\\nother and transport for each other such cars over each other's tracks by\\nway of such switch connection or interchange track, and if no such\\nswitch connection or interchange track exist to construct and maintain\\nsaid switch connection or interchange track, and to make within a\\nspecified time not less than thirty days an agreement between them as to\\nthe terms of such receipt and transportation of cars, and if so required\\nas to the division of the expense of such construction and maintenance\\nof switch connection or interchange track; and in case such agreement be\\nnot so made within the time so specified, the commissioner shall after a\\nhearing declare by supplemental order the terms and conditions upon\\nwhich such cars shall be received and transported, and if so required\\nthe portion of such expense to which each common carrier affected\\nthereby shall be entitled and the manner in which any sums of money to\\nwhich any such common carrier is entitled shall be paid and secured, and\\nsuch supplemental order shall take effect as part of the original order\\nfrom the time such supplemental order shall become effective. Nothing in\\nthis subdivision shall require a through route between railroad\\ncompanies and street railroad companies between points reached by such\\nrailroad companies. In case upon the termination of a lease or otherwise\\nthe owner or lessor of a rapid transit railroad resumes operation\\nthereof and thereupon such owner or lessor or the lessee discontinues or\\nthreatens to discontinue or refuses or threatens to refuse to permit\\noperation over any extension or extensions of such rapid transit\\nrailroad or railroads or any of them, or discontinues or threatens to\\ndiscontinue or refuses or threatens to refuse to permit operation over\\nother railroads on which such lessee had operated under trackage rights,\\nthen and in either of those events the commissioner may order that\\nthrough cars for the transportation of passengers shall be operated over\\nsuch extension or extensions and over the tracks of such other railroad\\nover which such lessee may have had trackage rights, and the\\ncommissioner shall have power, after a hearing to require by order such\\noperating, including the right to order such switch or other connections\\nor interchange tracks as may be necessary, and if so required to\\ndetermine as to the division of the expense of the maintenance and\\noperation thereof. The commissioner may, after a hearing, prescribe the\\nterms and conditions upon which such operations shall be conducted and\\nthe manner in which receipts and expenses shall be apportioned.  Pending\\nthe hearing or hearings provided for herein, and the determinations and\\norders of the commissioner thereon, the commissioner shall have power,\\nif in his judgment the public interest requires it, to issue a temporary\\norder requiring said rapid transit railroad companies to receive from\\neach other, and transport for each other, such cars over each other's\\ntracks by way of switch connection or interchange track, and if no such\\nswitch connection or interchange track exists, to construct and maintain\\nsaid switch connection or interchange track; and upon the completion of\\nsaid hearing or hearings, and the determinations and orders of the\\ncommissioner thereafter made, the terms of the receipt and\\ntransportation of cars, and the readjustment of compensation and expense\\ninvolved, shall take effect as of the original date of such temporary\\norder of the commissioner. If upon the expiration or earlier termination\\nof a lease, the free transfer or interchange of passengers, theretofore\\nin effect and permitted by the lessee of a rapid transit railroad at any\\npoint or points between the lines of the rapid transit railroads owned\\nor leased and operated by it, is discontinued or is threatened to be\\ndiscontinued, the commissioner shall have power by order to require the\\ncompanies, by which the said lines of rapid transit railroads may be\\noperated after the termination of the lease, to continue or re-establish\\nsuch through routes formerly existing, and to establish joint rates,\\nfares and charges for the transportation of passengers thereon in the\\nmanner provided by subdivision three. Pending the hearing or hearings\\nprovided for herein, and the determinations and orders of the\\ncommissioner thereon, the commissioner shall have power to issue a\\ntemporary order requiring the companies then operating said lines of\\nrapid transit railroad to restore the said free transfer or interchange\\nof passengers at the point or points on said rapid transit railroad\\nlines where the said free transfer or interchange was formerly in effect\\nand permitted; and upon the completion of said hearing or hearings, and\\nthe determinations and orders of the commissioner thereafter made, the\\nterms and conditions under which the portion of said joint rates, fares\\nand charges to which each company shall be entitled and the manner in\\nwhich the same shall be paid and secured, shall take effect as of the\\noriginal date of such temporary order of the commissioner.\\n",

Failure of\\nthe holder or of any person possessing such number plates to deliver\\nsuch number plates to any police officer who requests the same pursuant\\nto this subdivision shall constitute a misdemeanor. The commissioner of\\nmotor vehicles shall have the authority to deny a registration or\\nrenewal application to any other person for the same vehicle and may\\ndeny a registration or renewal application for any other motor vehicle\\nregistered in the name of the applicant where it has been determined\\nthat such registrant's intent has been to evade the purposes of this\\nsubdivision and where the commissioner of motor vehicles has reasonable\\ngrounds to believe that such registration or renewal will have the\\neffect of defeating the purposes of this subdivision.

The\\ncommissioner of motor vehicles shall have the authority to deny a\\nregistration or renewal application to any other person for the same\\nvehicle where it has been determined that such registrant's intent has\\nbeen to evade the purposes of this paragraph and where the commissioner\\nof motor vehicles has reasonable grounds to believe that such\\nregistration or renewal will have the effect of defeating the purposes\\nof this paragraph. The procedure on any such suspension shall be the\\nsame as in the case of a suspension under the vehicle and traffic law.\\nOperation of such motor vehicle while under suspension as provided in\\nthis subdivision shall constitute a class A misdemeanor.\\n  * NB Effective until February 3, 2021\\n  * b.

The procedure on any such suspension shall be the\\nsame as in the case of a suspension under the vehicle and traffic law.\\nOperation of such motor vehicle while under suspension as provided in\\nthis subdivision shall constitute a class A misdemeanor.\\n  (ii) (a) Upon the seizure of number plates pursuant to subparagraph\\n(i) of this paragraph, if the out-of-service defect is of a type where\\npursuant to the commissioner's regulations no inspection certificate\\nwill be issued until the defect is repaired and a re-inspection is\\nconducted, or is related to its horn, and the commissioner determines\\nthat allowing the altered motor vehicle to leave the inspection area\\nwould be contrary to public safety, the commissioner may: (A) remove or\\narrange for the removal of, or may direct any police officer to remove\\nor arrange for the removal of, the altered motor vehicle to a non-public\\ngarage or other place of safety where it shall remain impounded, subject\\nto the provisions of this section; or (B) immobilize or arrange for the\\nimmobilization of the altered motor vehicle on premises owned or under\\nthe control of the owner of such altered motor vehicle, subject to the\\nprovisions of this section.

For the purpose of achieving a\\nstable rate structure through regulated competition, the commissioner\\nshall establish rules and regulations with respect to collective\\nratemaking procedures for all motor carrier transportation services over\\nwhich the commissioner has jurisdiction. Any common carrier of property\\nor passengers by motor vehicle subject to regulation by the commissioner\\nand party to an agreement between or among two or more carriers relating\\nto rates, fares, classifications, divisions, allowances or charges,\\nincluding charges between carriers and compensation paid or received for\\nthe use of facilities and equipment, or rules and regulations pertaining\\nthereto, or procedures for the joint consideration, initiation or\\nestablishment thereof, may, under such rules and regulations as the\\ncommissioner may prescribe, apply to the commissioner for approval of\\nthe agreement, and the commissioner shall by order approve any such\\nagreement if it is found that, by reason of the transportation policy\\ndeclared in section one hundred thirty-seven of this article, the relief\\nprovided in subdivision seven of this section should apply with respect\\nto the making and carrying out of such agreement; otherwise the\\napplication shall be denied. The approval of the commissioner shall be\\ngranted only upon such terms and conditions as the commissioner may\\nprescribe as necessary to carry out the purposes of this article.\\n  2. Each conference, bureau, committee or other organization\\nestablished or continued pursuant to any such agreement approved by the\\ncommissioner under this section shall maintain such accounts, records,\\nfiles and memoranda and shall submit to the commissioner such\\ninformation and reports as may be prescribed by the commissioner and all\\nsuch accounts, records, files and memoranda shall be subject to\\ninspection by the commissioner or department representatives.\\n  3. The commissioner shall not approve any such agreement which is an\\nagreement with respect to a pooling or division of traffic, or service,\\nor of gross or net earnings, or of any portion thereof.\\n  4. The commissioner shall not approve under this section any agreement\\nwhich establishes a procedure for the determination of any matter\\nthrough joint consideration unless it is found that under the agreement\\nthere is accorded to each party the free and unrestrained right to take\\nindependent action either before or after any determination arrived at\\nthrough such procedure.\\n  5. The commissioner is authorized, upon complaint or upon the\\ncommissioner's initiative without complaint, to investigate and\\ndetermine whether any such agreement previously approved under this\\nsection, or terms and conditions upon which such approval was granted,\\nis not or are not, in conformity with the standards set forth in\\nsubdivision one of this section, or whether any such terms and\\nconditions are unnecessary for the purposes of conformity with such\\nstandards, and, after such investigation, the commissioner may by order\\nterminate or modify any approval of such agreement, or modify the terms\\nand conditions of such approval, if such action is necessary to assure\\nconformity with such standards. The effective date of any order\\nterminating or modifying approval, or modifying terms and conditions,\\nshall be postponed for such period as the commissioner determines to be\\nreasonably necessary to avoid undue hardships.\\n  6. No order shall be entered under this section except after\\ninterested parties have been afforded reasonable notice and opportunity\\nto be heard.\\n  7. Parties to any such agreement approved by the commissioner under\\nthis section and other parties are hereby relieved from the operation of\\nsection three hundred forty of the general business law with respect to\\nthe making of such agreement, and with respect to the carrying out of\\nsuch agreement in conformity with the terms and conditions prescribed by\\nthe commissioner.\\n  8. Rate conferences, by regulating collective ratemaking under the\\nsupervision of the department, have established a system of pricing\\nactively supervised by the department which fosters competition through\\napproved rate levels and the right of independent action while\\nfurnishing a responsible transportation service to the public. Continued\\ndepartmental supervision of proposed rate filings by such conferences\\nwill continue to yield advantageous transportation rates which, although\\nthey may tend to displace competition in the classical sense, in\\nactuality foster responsible, competitive motor carrier transportation\\nservice to the public, while concurrently developing and approving\\ncompetitive rate levels among motor carriers in furtherance of the\\ntransportation policy contained in section one hundred thirty-seven of\\nthis chapter. The dangers inherent in a consumer's selection of a motor\\ncarrier on the basis of price alone will also be discouraged.\\n",

Any certificate or\\npermit may, after a hearing, be suspended, cancelled, revoked or\\nmodified, in whole or in part, for failure to comply with the provisions\\nof this chapter or with any lawful rule, order or regulation of the\\ncommissioner promulgated hereunder or with any term, condition, or\\nlimitation of such certificate or permit or for failure to render\\nreasonably continuous service within the scope of the certificate or\\npermit.\\n  2. The commissioner may upon complaint or upon the commissioner's\\ninitiative without complaint institute proceedings to revoke, cancel,\\nsuspend or modify any certificate or permit issued pursuant to this\\nchapter after a hearing at which the holder of such certificate or\\npermit and any person making such complaint shall be given an\\nopportunity to be heard. Provided, however, that any order of the\\ncommissioner revoking, cancelling, suspending or modifying any\\ncertificate or permit shall not become effective until thirty days after\\nthe serving of notice thereof upon the holder of such certificate or\\npermit, unless the commissioner determines that the continued holding of\\nsuch certificate or permit for such period would be contrary to the\\npublic interest. Hearings shall be held in such manner and upon such\\nnotice as may be prescribed by rules of the commissioner, but such\\nnotice shall be of not less than ten days and shall state the nature of\\nthe complaint.\\n  3. In addition to, or in lieu of, any sanctions set forth in this\\nsection, the commissioner may, after a hearing, impose a penalty not to\\nexceed a maximum of ten thousand dollars in any one proceeding upon any\\nperson if the commissioner finds that such person or officer, agent or\\nemployee thereof has failed to comply with the requirements of this\\nchapter or any rule, regulation or order of the commissioner promulgated\\nthereunder. If such penalty is not paid within four months, the amount\\nthereof may be entered as a judgment in the office of the clerk of the\\ncounty of Albany and in any other county in which the person resides,\\nhas a place of business or through which it operates. Thereafter, if\\nsaid judgment has not been satisfied within ninety days, any certificate\\nor permit held by any such person may be revoked upon notice but without\\na further hearing. Provided, however, that if a person shall apply for a\\nrehearing of the determination of the penalty pursuant to the provisions\\nof section eighty-nine of this chapter, judgment shall not be entered\\nuntil a determination has been made on the application for a rehearing.\\nFurther provided however, that if after a rehearing a penalty is imposed\\nand such penalty is not paid within four months of the date of service\\nof the rehearing decision, the amount of such penalty may be entered as\\na judgment in the office of the clerk of the county of Albany and in any\\nother county in which the person resides, has a place of business or\\nthrough which it operates. Thereafter, if said judgment has not been\\nsatisfied within ninety days, any certificate or permit held by any such\\nperson may be revoked upon notice but without a further hearing.\\n  4. If after notice and opportunity to be heard, the commissioner shall\\nfind that any person or persons is or are providing transportation\\nsubject to regulation under this chapter without having any certificate\\nor permit, or is or are holding themselves out to the public by\\nadvertising or any other means to provide such transportation without\\nhaving any certificate or permit or approval from a city having\\njurisdiction pursuant to section eighty of this chapter, the\\ncommissioner may notify the commissioner of motor vehicles to that\\neffect and the commissioner of motor vehicles shall thereupon suspend\\nthe registration or registrations of all motor vehicles owned or\\noperated by such person or persons except private passenger automobiles\\nuntil such time as the commissioner of transportation may give notice\\nthat the violation has been satisfactorily adjusted, and the\\ncommissioner of motor vehicles may direct any police officer to secure\\npossession of the number plates of such motor vehicles and to return the\\nsame to the commissioner of motor vehicles. Failure of the holder or of\\nany person possessing such number plates to deliver such number plates\\nto any police officer who requests the same pursuant to this subdivision\\nshall constitute a misdemeanor. The commissioner of motor vehicles shall\\nhave the authority to deny a registration or renewal application to any\\nother person for the same vehicle and may deny a registration or renewal\\napplication for any other motor vehicle registered in the name of the\\napplicant where it has been determined that such registrant's intent has\\nbeen to evade the purposes of this subdivision and where the\\ncommissioner of motor vehicles has reasonable grounds to believe that\\nsuch registration or renewal will have the effect of defeating the\\npurposes of this subdivision. The procedure on any such suspension shall\\nbe the same as in the case of a suspension under the vehicle and traffic\\nlaw. Operation of any motor vehicle while under suspension as herein\\nprovided shall constitute a class A misdemeanor. A person who operates a\\nmotor vehicle while such vehicle is under suspension as provided in this\\nsubdivision in a manner that causes the death of another person, knowing\\nthat the operation of such vehicle is in violation of this subdivision,\\nshall be guilty of a class E felony.\\n  5. Any person, whether carrier, passenger, shipper, consignee, or\\nbroker, or any officer, employee, agent or representative thereof, who\\nshall knowingly offer, grant or give or solicit, accept, or receive any\\nrebate, concession or discrimination in violation of this chapter, or\\nwho by means of any false statement or representation, or by the use of\\nany false or fictitious bill, bill of lading, receipt, voucher, roll,\\naccount, claim, certificate, affidavit, deposition, lease or bill of\\nsale, or by any other means or device, shall knowingly and willfully\\nassist, suffer or permit any person or persons to obtain transportation\\nof property or passengers subject to this chapter for less than the\\napplicable rate, toll or charge, or who, with respect to the\\ntransportation of household goods, shall knowingly or willfully\\nmisrepresent the applicable rate for transportation or the weight of a\\nshipment or the cost of transportation to the shipper, or who shall\\nknowingly and willfully by any such means or otherwise fraudulently seek\\nto evade or defeat regulation as provided for in this chapter, shall be\\nguilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction thereof be fined not more\\nthan one thousand dollars for the first offense and not more than two\\nthousand five hundred dollars for any subsequent offense.\\n  6. Any person who shall provide transportation for compensation within\\nthe state, or hold himself or herself out to the public by advertising\\nor any other means to provide such transportation, when such\\ntransportation requires either the permission or approval of the\\ncommissioner, or the permission, approval or franchise of any city\\nhaving regulatory jurisdiction over such transportation and who does not\\npossess a valid permit, certificate or approval for such transportation,\\nfrom the commissioner or from such city, shall be guilty of a traffic\\ninfraction punishable by a fine of not less than one thousand dollars\\nand not more than one thousand five hundred dollars for the first\\noffense. A violation of this subdivision by a person who has previously\\nbeen convicted of such offense within five years of the violation shall\\nbe a misdemeanor and shall be punishable by a fine of not less than two\\nthousand dollars and not more than five thousand dollars, or by\\nimprisonment for not more than sixty days, or by both such fine and\\nimprisonment. Upon conviction as a second or subsequent offender as\\ndescribed herein the court may order forfeiture of any right, title or\\ninterest held by the defendant in any motor vehicle used in the\\ncommission of such offense pursuant to the provisions of subdivision\\nseven of this section. In addition to, or in lieu of, any sanction set\\nforth in this subdivision, the commissioner may, after a hearing, impose\\na penalty equal to the gain or profit derived from transportation\\nservices conducted in violation of this subdivision. Any person holding\\nregulatory authority or a franchise from either the commissioner or any\\ncity having regulatory jurisdiction over such transportation, or any\\npublic transportation authority created pursuant to title nine, eleven,\\neleven-A, eleven-B, eleven-C or eleven-D of article five of the public\\nauthorities law, who is being adversely affected by a person providing\\ntransportation without having the necessary regulatory authority or\\nfranchise from the commissioner or any such city, may bring suit in his,\\nher or its own behalf to restrain such person and recover damages\\nresulting from the actions of such person.\\n  7. (a) Whenever it appears that any person is violating the provisions\\nof subdivision six of this section, the commissioner acting by the\\nattorney general, or the city acting by its corporation counsel, or\\ndesignee, may bring suit against such person in any court of competent\\njurisdiction to restrain such person from continuing such violation. In\\nany such suit, the court shall have jurisdiction to grant to the\\ncommissioner or city without bond or other undertaking, such prohibitory\\nor mandatory injunctions as the facts may warrant, including temporary\\nrestraining orders and preliminary or permanent injunctions, and to levy\\nupon the gain or profit that may be subject to a penalty pursuant to\\nsubdivision six of this section. In cities with a population of one\\nmillion or more, the police department shall have the power to issue\\nsummonses for violations of subdivision six of this section and those\\nsummonses shall be adjudicated according to the rules and regulations\\nset forth in article two-A of the vehicle and traffic law. The hearing\\nofficer responsible for adjudication of any violation of such\\nsubdivision six shall review the record of any person found guilty of\\nviolating such subdivision six to determine whether or not that person\\nhas a prior conviction under such subdivision six. After a review of the\\nrecord, if it is found that there has been a prior conviction, the\\nhearing officer shall refer the matter to the appropriate local criminal\\ncourt for prosecution under this article.\\n  (b) Any person convicted as a third or subsequent offender as\\ndescribed in subdivision six shall be subject to a court order divesting\\nhim of any right, title or interest in any motor vehicle used in the\\ncommission of the offense. An action for forfeiture may be commenced by\\nthe attorney general on behalf of the commissioner or the corporation\\ncounsel or designee on behalf of the city in any superior court in the\\ncounty of conviction. The defendant shall have a right to a trial by\\njury on any issue of fact. The plaintiff in the forfeiture action shall\\nhave the burden of proof by clear and convincing evidence on such issues\\nof fact.\\n  (c) Any order of forfeiture issued pursuant to this subdivision shall\\ninclude provisions for the disposal of the property found to have been\\nforfeited. Such provisions shall be directed to the attorney general or\\ncorporation counsel or designee as the case may be, and may include, but\\nare not limited to, an order directing that the property be sold in\\naccordance with provisions of article fifty-one of the civil practice\\nlaw and rules. Net proceeds of the sale shall be paid into the general\\nfund of the state or city, as the case may be, less all costs and\\nattendant expenses of seizure, storage and forfeiture, as the case may\\nbe, which shall be paid to the office of the attorney general or\\ncorporation counsel in the appropriate case notwithstanding any other\\nprovisions of law.\\n  8. All penalties charged and collected by the commissioner pursuant to\\nthis section shall be deposited by the comptroller into the special\\nobligation reserve and payment account of the dedicated highway and\\nbridge trust fund established pursuant to section eight-nine-b of the\\nstate finance law.\\n",

It\\nshall be the duty of every common carrier of household goods to\\nestablish, observe and enforce just and reasonable rates, charges and\\nclassifications, and just and reasonable regulations and practices\\nrelating thereto.\\n  2. Common carriers of household goods by motor vehicle may establish\\nthrough routes and joint rates, charges and classifications with other\\nsuch carriers and once established it shall be the duty of all such\\ncarrier parties to establish just and reasonable rates, charges,\\nclassifications, regulations and practices and equitable divisions of\\nrevenue.\\n  3. All charges made for any service rendered, or to be rendered by any\\ncommon carrier of household goods by motor vehicle, shall be just and\\nreasonable and every unjust and unreasonable charge for such service or\\nany part thereof, is prohibited and declared to be unlawful. It shall be\\nunlawful for any common carrier of household goods to make, give or\\ncause any undue or unreasonable preference or advantage to any\\nparticular persons, in any respect whatsoever or to subject any\\nparticular person, area or description of traffic to any unjust\\ndiscrimination or any undue or unreasonable prejudice or disadvantage in\\nany respect whatsoever.\\n  4. Whenever, after a hearing, upon complaint, or in an investigation\\non the commissioner's own initiative, the commissioner shall determine\\nthat any individual or joint rate, charge or classification in effect or\\nproposed to be put into effect by any common carrier of household goods\\nor group of common carriers of household goods by motor vehicle or any\\nrule, regulation or practice whatsoever affecting such rate, charge or\\nclassification, or the value of the service thereunder, is or will be\\nunjust or unreasonable, or unjustly discriminatory, unduly preferential\\nor unduly prejudicial, the commissioner shall determine and prescribe\\nthe lawful rate, charge or classification, or the lawful rule,\\nregulation or practice thereafter to be observed.\\n  5. The commissioner shall, whenever deemed necessary or desirable in\\nthe public interest, after a hearing, upon complaint, or upon his own\\ninitiative, establish through routes and joint rates, charges,\\nclassifications, regulations or practices, applicable to the\\ntransportation of property by common carriers of household goods and the\\nterms and conditions under which such through routes shall be operated.\\n  6. Whenever, after a hearing, upon complaint or upon the\\ncommissioner's own initiative, the commissioner determines that the\\ndivisions of joint rates, charges or classifications applicable to the\\ntransportation of household goods by common carriers are or will be\\nunjust, unreasonable, inequitable, or unduly preferential or prejudicial\\nas between the carrier parties, the commissioner shall by order\\nprescribe the just, reasonable and equitable divisions thereof. The\\norder of the commissioner may require the adjustment of divisions\\nbetween the carriers, in accordance with the order, from the date of\\nfiling the complaint or entry of order of investigations, or such other\\ndate subsequent as the commissioner finds justified and, in the case of\\njoint rates, charges or classifications prescribed by the commissioner,\\nthe order as to divisions may be made effective as a part of the\\noriginal order.\\n  7. In proceedings to determine the reasonableness of rates, charges or\\nclassifications of a common carrier of household goods or group of\\ncommon carriers of household goods, the commissioner shall authorize\\nrevenue levels that are adequate under efficient management to cover\\ntotal operating expenses, plus a reasonable profit as determined by the\\ncommissioner.\\n  8. The commissioner may not investigate, suspend, revise or revoke any\\nrate or charge proposed by a carrier if the proposed rate does not\\nincrease or reduce any existing rate or charge by more than ten percent\\nin any twelve-month period. This subdivision does not apply to rates\\nthat are proposed through the collective actions of the members of a\\nrate conference.\\n  9. Any rate or charge that in any twelve-month period is increased or\\nreduced by more than the percentage specified in subdivision eight of\\nthis section must be accompanied by such financial, statistical, cost\\nand other data as the commissioner may prescribe by regulation to\\njustify such change. Any such rate or charge is subject to\\ninvestigation, suspension, revision or revocation.\\n  10.  Prior to entering into an agreement to render services, every\\ncommon carrier of household goods shall inform each shipper of the\\navailability of a written estimate of the total cost of services if\\nrequested at least seventy-two hours in advance of an actual move. If so\\nrequested by a shipper, every common carrier of household goods shall\\nissue to each shipper an estimated total cost of services form which\\nshall not serve as the actual contract between the shipper and such\\ncarrier but shall be given as an educated prediction of the total cost\\nfor services to be rendered, except that such estimate shall not be\\nrequired for moves of household goods involving one room of four hundred\\nsquare feet or less.  The estimate for all services provided shall be in\\nwriting and shall be fully completed in all respects, and shall be\\nrendered only after a physical examination by the carrier. The\\ncommissioner shall promulgate a sample estimated cost of services form\\nand each carrier may adopt any form substantially similar to the said\\nform, which shall also include a statement, in bold face type,\\nindicating that the tariff in effect at the time of the shipment shall\\ngovern the final charges for the shipment.  In addition to specific\\nrates and charges required to be filed pursuant to section one hundred\\nninety-seven of this article, a common carrier of household goods may\\nalso offer shippers a written binding estimate of the total\\ntransportation charges for the transportation of household goods as\\ndefined in paragraphs (a) and (b) of subdivision fifteen of section two\\nof this chapter. Provided, however, that if a carrier elects to offer\\nwritten binding estimates it must specifically state so in its tariff\\nand must make such option available on a nonpreferential basis to all\\nshippers as an alternative to the specific rates and charges detailed in\\nits tariff. The written binding estimate shall be in the form and\\ncontain such information as the commissioner may prescribe by\\nregulation.\\n",

              "text" : "  § 222. Applicability; general provisions of grade crossing\\nelimination. 1. This article shall apply to all highway-railroad grade\\ncrossing eliminations the construction work for which is commenced on or\\nafter March first, nineteen hundred seventy-one, except that any such\\nprojects authorized pursuant to the provisions of the highway law may be\\nconstructed in accordance therewith. Construction commenced on\\nhighway-railroad grade crossing elimination projects before March first,\\nnineteen hundred seventy-one pursuant to orders of the public service\\ncommission shall be completed in accordance with this article.\\n  2. The commissioner shall report not later than December first in each\\nyear to the governor, the chairman of the finance committee of the\\nsenate and the chairman of the ways and means committee of the assembly,\\nthe projects which have been completed during the preceding twelve\\nmonths, those under construction, those ordered but upon which\\nconstruction work has not been started, the amount expended on the\\ncompleted and partially completed work, an estimate of the cost of work\\nnot completed and an estimate of the cost of eliminations ordered\\nrespecting which no expenditures have been made.\\n  3. The governing body of any municipality in which a highway-railroad\\ngrade crossing is located or any railroad company for any railroad\\noperated by it which has railroad tracks that are crossed at grade by a\\nhighway may petition the commissioner to institute grade crossing\\nelimination procedures pursuant to this article. The commissioner shall\\nhold public hearings on any elimination requested by such petition which\\nin his judgment warrants examination. Upon his own motion, the\\ncommissioner may investigate any other highway-railroad grade crossing\\nwhich he determines should be considered for elimination. The\\ncommissioner, upon such notice as he shall deem reasonable to the\\nmunicipality in which the highway-railroad grade crossing is located,\\nthe railroad company whose railroad tracks are crossed at grade by the\\nhighway and any other party deemed by the commissioner to be interested\\nin the elimination procedure, shall hold public hearings to consider any\\nsuch elimination. The commissioner shall promulgate rules and\\nregulations concerning the procedure to be followed at such hearings and\\nthe matters to be considered at such hearings.\\n  4. After the conclusion of such hearings, the commissioner shall, by\\norder, determine whether it is in the public interest to require the\\nelimination of such highway-railroad grade crossing. Any elimination\\norder shall also determine the manner in which such elimination shall be\\nmade including a determination as to the alteration to be made in such\\ncrossing, its approaches, the method of crossing, the character of the\\nstructure and approaches, the type and extent of pavement, the location\\nof the crossing, the closing and discontinuance of a crossing and the\\ndiversion of traffic from an existing crossing to an existing or a new\\nhighway, road, street or crossing, or the opening of an additional\\ncrossing and also including, if so determined by the commissioner, a\\nchange in the location of the railroad when necessary to effect the\\nelimination of such crossing. Whenever the commissioner shall have, by\\norder, determined that it is in the public interest to require the\\nelimination of two or more grade crossings, and if it appears that the\\ncost would not substantially exceed the cost of the eliminations at the\\npresent locations, and if the public interest is better served and the\\nnumber of such eliminations could be reduced by relocating the railroad,\\nthe commissioner after a hearing may order such relocation.  Such\\nhearing shall be held upon such notice as the commissioner shall deem\\nreasonable, but not less than ten days, to the railroad company\\ninvolved. Notice shall also be given to the municipalities and persons\\ndeemed by the commissioner to be interested in the elimination\\nprocedure.  The commissioner shall serve a certified copy of all orders\\non the comptroller, the railroad, the municipalities affected thereby\\nand all other parties to the proceeding.\\n  5. In connection with a grade crossing elimination project, the\\ncommissioner shall determine the work on the railroad tracks or other\\nrailroad facilities which is to be performed by railroad company forces,\\nshall direct the railroad company to perform such work and shall direct\\nthe railroad company to prepare plans and estimates of cost for such\\nwork and submit such plans and estimates to the commissioner for\\napproval.\\n  6. After the commissioner shall have issued an elimination order in\\nconnection with a grade crossing elimination project, the department of\\ntransportation, except for the work on the railroad tracks or other\\nrailroad facilities to be performed by railroad company forces, shall\\ncause to be prepared the plans, specifications and estimates of cost of\\nsuch elimination project. Such plans shall specifically show that part\\nof the work of the elimination which when completed shall be maintained\\nby the railroad company and that part which shall be maintained by the\\nstate or the municipality in which the work of the elimination is\\nlocated, as provided in the highway law where a state highway is\\ninvolved and in the railroad law where a highway other than a state\\nhighway is involved, and such plans shall also show that part of the\\nwork of the elimination which shall be otherwise maintained.\\n  7. If a state department, agency or commission, public authority or\\nmunicipality in which the work of the elimination is located, desires to\\nmake or cause to have made changes or additions which in the opinion of\\nthe commissioner are other than necessary for the elimination, and\\ndesires such changes and/or additions to be done in connection with the\\nwork of the elimination, the commissioner shall hold a hearing to\\ndetermine if such changes and/or additions shall be included in the\\nplans and specifications. However, in any case where the interested\\nparties shall have agreed in writing to such changes and/or additions no\\nhearing shall be required unless the commissioner shall so direct.  The\\ncommissioner in an order containing findings shall specify which such\\nchanges and/or additions are approved and shall be included in the plans\\nand specifications for the elimination project. Such order shall also\\nstate an estimated cost of such desired changes and/or additions other\\nthan necessary for the elimination, and the portions thereof chargeable,\\nrespectively, to the state department, agency or commission, public\\nauthority or municipality in which the work of the elimination is\\nlocated.\\n  Prior to the award of any contract containing changes and/or additions\\nother than necessary for the elimination, the state department, agency\\nor commission desiring such changes and/or additions shall certify to\\nthe commissioner that the funds necessary for the payment of the cost of\\nsuch desired changes and/or additions other than necessary for the\\nelimination, have been made available for that purpose. In the case of a\\npublic authority or municipality, such public authority or municipality\\nshall deposit the necessary funds with the comptroller, who shall\\nreceive and accept the same for the purposes hereof, subject to the\\ndraft or requisition of the commissioner. When the elimination project\\nhas been completed and the cost thereof shall have been paid by the\\nstate, the commissioner shall render to such public authority or the\\ngoverning body of such municipality an itemized statement showing in\\nfull (a) the amount of money that has been deposited by such public\\nauthority or municipality with the comptroller as hereinbefore provided,\\nand (b) all disbursements which have been made hereunder. Any surplus\\nmoney shall be paid to such public authority or municipality on the\\nwarrant of the comptroller on vouchers therefor approved by the\\ncommissioner. In the event, upon the completion of the elimination\\nproject, it is determined by the commissioner that the amount of the\\ncost to be borne by such public authority or municipality is in excess\\nof the amount deposited by such public authority or municipality with\\nthe comptroller, then, in such event, such public authority or\\nmunicipality shall within ninety days of the receipt of the notice from\\nthe commissioner of the amount of the deficiency required to fully\\ncompensate the state for the public authority's or municipality's cost\\nfor such desired changes and/or additions other than necessary for the\\nelimination, pay such amount to the comptroller.\\n  8. If a municipality desires to have the elimination accomplished in a\\nmanner or by a method which is different and more costly than that\\nordered by the commissioner, such municipality may petition the\\ncommissioner to consider such different manner or method. The\\ncommissioner may consider such petition if he deems the filing thereof\\nto be timely and, after a public hearing for such purpose, determines\\nthat the different manner or method is feasible and will serve the\\npublic interest as well as that originally proposed and ordered by him.\\nThe commissioner shall cause to be prepared an estimate of cost for the\\nelimination project utilizing the different manner or method, as well as\\nan estimate of cost for the elimination project as originally proposed.\\nThe municipality shall be advised of the estimated additional costs and\\nexpenses to be borne by such municipality to provide for such different\\nmanner or method of construction. The commissioner may amend the\\nelimination order so as to include the different manner or method of\\nconstruction provided the governing body of such municipality shall by\\nresolution assume the responsibility for the additional costs and\\nexpenses to provide such different manner or method of construction.\\nAfter the elimination order has been amended, the commissioner shall\\ncause to be prepared the plans, specifications and estimates of cost of\\nsuch elimination project. When such municipality approves such plans,\\nspecifications and estimates of cost, it shall by resolution appropriate\\nthe funds necessary to provide for the portion of the costs and expenses\\nof the project to be borne by such municipality. Such funds shall, prior\\nto the advertisement for bids for the elimination project, be deposited\\nby such municipality with the comptroller, who is authorized to receive\\nand accept the same for the purposes hereof, subject to the draft or\\nrequisition of the commissioner, and a certified copy of such resolution\\nshall be filed with the comptroller and with the commissioner. The\\nmoneys so required shall be raised by tax or pursuant to the local\\nfinance law or in accordance with any local charter or law, as the case\\nmay be. Upon the completion of the elimination project the commissioner\\nshall transmit to the governing body of such municipality an itemized\\nstatement showing in full (a) the amount of money that has been\\ndeposited by such municipality with the comptroller as hereinbefore\\nprovided, and (b) all disbursements which have been made hereunder.  Any\\nsurplus money shall be paid to such municipality on the warrant of the\\ncomptroller on vouchers therefor approved by the commissioner. In the\\nevent, upon the completion of the elimination project, it is determined\\nby the commissioner that the amount of the cost to be borne by such\\nmunicipality is in excess of the amount deposited by such municipality\\nwith the comptroller, then, in such event, such municipality shall\\nwithin ninety days of the receipt of the notice from the commissioner of\\nthe amount of the deficiency required to fully compensate the state for\\nthe municipality's cost for such different manner or method of\\nconstruction, pay such amount to the comptroller. Two or more\\nmunicipalities may share the cost for such different manner or method of\\nconstruction in such proportions as they shall mutually agree.  Whenever\\nsuch a different manner or method of construction is utilized in a grade\\ncrossing elimination project, the determination of the net benefit to\\nthe railroad company shall be based on the estimate of cost for the\\nelimination project as originally proposed.\\n  9. A railroad company may request railroad improvements not an\\nessential part of the elimination and such improvements may be included\\nin the elimination order provided the commissioner determines that such\\nimprovements do not adversely affect the project and the comptroller\\napproves the inclusion of such improvements in the project. Such\\napproval may contain such conditions, in respect to repayment, as the\\ncomptroller may deem necessary in the interest of the state. If the\\ncommissioner determines that such improvements will affect the\\nmunicipality in which the work of the elimination is located or the\\nproperty owners adjacent to such project, he may hold a public hearing\\nto consider such improvements prior to issuance of the elimination\\norder.\\n  10. Any elimination order made by the commissioner shall specify\\nincidental improvements, if any, rendered necessary or desirable because\\nof such elimination and which reasonably can be included in the\\nengineering plans therefor.\\n",

The commissioner shall cause to be prepared an accurate\\nacquisition map of any and all property which he may deem necessary for\\npurposes connected with the elimination of any grade crossing, or of any\\nproperty in and to which he may deem the acquisition or exercise of an\\neasement, interest or right to be necessary for such purposes,\\nindicating and describing in each case the particular easement, interest\\nor right. Such property may be acquired with controlled access when\\nacquired in connection with the construction of a controlled access\\nhighway as defined by the highway law. On the approval of such map by\\nthe commissioner, he may acquire such property, controlled access\\nrights, easements, interests or rights, pursuant to the provisions of\\nthe eminent domain procedure law.\\n  2. If the commissioner shall determine, prior to the filing of such\\nmap in the office of the county clerk or register of the county, that\\nchanges, alterations or modifications of such map as filed in the main\\noffice of the department should be made, he or she shall, subject to the\\nprovisions of article two of the eminent domain procedure law, if\\napplicable, direct the preparation of an amended map, either by\\npreparing a new map or by making changes on the original tracing of such\\nmap, with a notation indicating such changes, and file a certified copy\\nof the same in the main office of the department in the same manner as\\nthe original map was filed and said amended map shall thereupon in all\\nrespects and for all purposes supersede the map previously filed.\\n  3. If the commissioner shall determine, prior to the filing of such\\ncopy of the acquisition map in the office of the county clerk or\\nregister as provided in section four hundred two of the eminent domain\\nprocedure law, that such map should be withdrawn, he or she shall file a\\ncertificate of withdrawal in the office of the department of law. Upon\\nthe filing of such certificate of withdrawal the map to which it refers\\nshall be cancelled and all rights thereunder shall cease and determine.\\n  4. The commissioner shall deliver to the attorney general a copy of\\nsuch acquisition map, whereupon it shall be the duty of the attorney\\ngeneral to advise and certify to the commissioner the names of the\\nowners of the property, easements, interests or rights described in the\\nsaid aquisition map, including the owners of any right, title or\\ninterest therein, pursuant to the requirements of section four hundred\\nthree of the eminent domain procedure law.\\n  5. If, at or after the vesting of title to such property in the people\\nof the state of New York in the manner provided for in the eminent\\ndomain procedure law, the commissioner shall deem it necessary to cause\\nthe removal of an owner or other occupant from such property, he may\\ncause such owner or other occupant to be removed therefrom by proceeding\\nin accordance with section four hundred five of such law. The\\nproceedings shall be brought in the name of the commissioner as agent of\\nthe state. If any person proceeded against shall contest the petition by\\nan answer, the attorney general shall be notified, and he thereafter\\nshall represent the petitioner in the proceedings. No execution shall\\nissue for costs, if any, awarded against the state or the commissioner,\\nbut they shall be part of the costs of the acquisition and be paid in\\nlike manner. Proceedings may be brought separately against one or more\\nof the owners or other occupants of a property, or one proceeding may be\\nbrought against all or several of the owners or other occupants of any\\nor all property within the territorial jurisdiction of the same justice\\nor judge; judgment shall effect or be made for immediate removal of\\npersons defaulting in appearance or in answering, or withdrawing their\\nanswers, if any, without awaiting the trial or decision of issues raised\\nby contestants, if any.\\n  6. Upon making any agreement provided for in section three hundred\\nfour of the eminent domain procedure law, the commissioner shall deliver\\nto the comptroller such agreement and a certificate stating the amount\\ndue such owner or owners thereunder on account of such acquisition of\\nhis or their property and the amount so fixed shall be paid out of the\\nstate treasury from moneys appropriated for purposes connected with\\nelimination of grade crossing projects but not until there shall have\\nbeen filed with the comptroller, a certificate of the attorney general\\nshowing the person or persons claiming the amount so agreed upon to be\\nlegally entitled thereto.\\n  7. Application for reimbursement of incidental expenses as provided in\\nsection seven hundred two of the eminent domain procedure law shall be\\nmade to the commissioner upon forms prescribed by him and shall be\\naccompanied by such information and evidence as the commissioner may\\nrequire. Upon approval of such application, the commissioner shall\\ndeliver a copy thereof to the comptroller together with a certificate\\nstating the amount due thereof, and the amount so fixed shall be paid\\nout of the state treasury after audit by the comptroller from moneys\\nappropriated for the acquisition of porperty under this article.\\n  8. The commissioner, with the approval of the director of the budget\\nshall establish and may from time to time amend rules and regulations\\nauthorizing the payment of actual reasonable and necessary moving\\nexpenses of occupants of property acquired pursuant to this article; of\\nactual direct losses of tangible personal property as a result of moving\\nor discontinuing a business or farm operation, but not exceeding an\\namount equal to the reasonable expenses that would have been required to\\nrelocate such property, as determined by the commissioner; and actual\\nreasonable expenses in searching for a replacement business or farm; or\\nin hardship cases for the advance payment of such expenses and losses.\\nFor the purposes of making payment of such expenses and losses only the\\nterm \"business\" means any lawful activity conducted primarily for\\nassisting in the purchase, sale, resale, manufacture, processing or\\nmarketing of products, commodities, personal property or services by the\\nerection and maintenance of an outdoor advertising display or displays,\\nwhether or not such display or displays are located on the premises on\\nwhich any of the above activities are conducted. Such rules and\\nregulations may further define the terms used in this subdivision. In\\nlieu of such actual reasonable and necessary moving expenses, any such\\ndisplaced owner or tenant of residential property may elect to accept a\\nmoving expense allowance, plus a dislocation allowance, determined in\\naccordance with a schedule prepared by the commissioner and made a part\\nof such rules and regulations.\\n  In lieu of such actual reasonable and necessary moving expenses, any\\nsuch displaced owner or tenant of commercial property who relocates or\\ndiscontinues his business or farm operation may elect to accept a fixed\\nrelocation payment in an amount equal to the average annual net earnings\\nof the business or farm operation, except that such payment shall be not\\nless than two thousand five hundred dollars nor more than ten thousand\\ndollars. In the case of a business, no such fixed relocation payment\\nshall be made unless the commissioner finds and determines that the\\nbusiness cannot be relocated without a substantial loss of its existing\\npatronage, and that the business is not part of a commercial enterprise\\nhaving at least one other establishment, which is not being acquired by\\nthe state or the United States, which is engaged in the same or similar\\nbusiness. In the case of a business which is to be discontinued but for\\nwhich the findings and determinations set forth above cannot be made,\\nthe commissioner may prepare an estimate of what the actual reasonable\\nand necessary moving expenses, exclusive of any storage charges, would\\nbe if the business were to be relocated and enter into an agreed\\nsettlement with the owner of such business for an amount not to exceed\\nsuch estimate in lieu of such actual reasonable and necessary moving\\nexpenses. Application for payment under this subdivision shall be made\\nto the commissioner upon forms prescribed by him and shall be\\naccompanied by such information and evidence as the commissioner may\\nrequire. Upon approval of such application, the commissioner shall\\ndeliver a copy thereof to the comptroller together with a certificate\\nstating the amount due thereunder, and the amount so fixed shall be paid\\nout of the state treasury after audit by the comptroller from moneys\\nappropriated for the acquisition of property under this section. As used\\nin this subdivision the term \"commercial property\" shall include\\nproperty owned by an individual, family, partnership, corporation,\\nassociation or a nonprofit organization and includes a farm operation.\\nAs used in this subdivision the term \"business\" means any lawful\\nactivity, except a farm operation, conducted primarily for the purchase,\\nsale, lease and rental of personal and real property, and for the\\nmanufacture, processing, or marketing of products, commodities, or any\\nother personal property; for the sale of services to the public; or by a\\nnonprofit organization.\\n  9. The commissioner pursuant to section three hundred five of the\\neminent domain procedure law may make agreements on such terms,\\nconditions and consideration as he deems beneficial to the state with\\nrespect to any property acquired whereby such property may be used and\\noccupied by the former owner, tenant or by any other party from a date\\nspecified in said agreement, until such time as the state requires and\\nobtains actual physical possession. The agreements for the use and\\noccupancy of such property may be managed, supervised and enforced (1)\\nby the staff, forces and equipment of the department; or (2) by the\\ncommissioner contracting for the management, supervision and enforcement\\nthereof with any person, firm or corporation; or (3) by a combination of\\nsuch methods. The use and occupancy of such property under this article\\nand the right of the state or its duly authorized agent to recover\\npossession thereof shall not be subject to the emergency housing rent\\ncontrol law.\\n  10. The commissioner may make supplemental relocation payments,\\nseparately computed and stated, to displaced owners and tenants of\\nresidential property acquired pursuant to this section who are entitled\\nthereto, as determined by him. The commissioner, with the approval of\\nthe director of the budget, may establish and from time to time amend\\nrules and regulations providing for such supplemental relocation\\npayments. Such rules and regulations may further define the terms used\\nin this subdivision. In the case of property acquired pursuant to this\\nsection which is improved by a dwelling actually owned and occupied by\\nthe displaced owner for not less than one hundred eighty days\\nimmediately prior to initiation of negotiations for the acquisition of\\nsuch property, such payment to such owner shall not exceed fifteen\\nthousand dollars. Such payment shall be the amount, if any, which, when\\nadded to the acquisition payment equals the average price, established\\nby the commissioner on a class, group or individual basis, required to\\nobtain a comparable replacement dwelling that is decent, safe and\\nsanitary to accommodate the displaced owner, reasonably accessible to\\npublic services and places of employment and available on the private\\nmarket, but in no event shall such payment exceed the difference between\\nacquisition payment and the actual purchase price of the replacement\\ndwelling. Such payment shall include an amount which will compensate\\nsuch displaced owner for any increased interest costs which such person\\nis required to pay for financing the acquisition of any such comparable\\nreplacement dwelling. Such amount shall be paid only if the dwelling\\nacquired pursuant to this section was encumbered by a bona fide mortgage\\nwhich was a valid lien on such dwelling for not less than one hundred\\neighty days prior to the initiation of negotiations for the acquisition\\nof such dwelling. Such amount shall be equal to the excess in the\\naggregate interest and other debt service costs of that amount of the\\nprincipal of the mortgage on the replacement dwelling which is equal to\\nthe unpaid balance of the mortgage on the acquired dwelling, over the\\nremainder term of the mortgage on the acquired dwelling, reduced to\\ndiscounted present value. The discount rate shall be the prevailing\\ninterest rate paid on savings deposits by commercial banks in the\\ngeneral area in which the replacement dwelling is located. Any such\\nmortgage interest differential payment shall, notwithstanding the\\nprovisions of section twenty-six-b of the general construction law, be\\nin lieu of and in full satisfaction of the requirements of such section.\\nSuch payment shall include reasonable expenses incurred by such\\ndisplaced owner for evidence of title, recording fees and other closing\\ncosts incident to the purchase of the replacement dwelling, but not\\nincluding prepaid expenses. Such payment shall be made only to a\\ndisplaced owner who purchases and occupies a replacement dwelling which\\nis decent, safe and sanitary within one year subsequent to the date on\\nwhich he is required to move from the dwelling acquired pursuant to this\\nsection or the date on which he receives from the state final payment of\\nall costs of the acquired dwelling, whichever occurs later, except\\nadvance payment of such amount may be made in hardship cases. In the\\ncase of property acquired pursuant to this section from which an\\nindividual or family, not otherwise eligible to receive a payment\\npursuant to the above provisions of this subdivision, is displaced from\\nany dwelling thereon which has been actually and lawfully occupied by\\nsuch individual or family for not less than ninety days immediately\\nprior to the initiation of negotiations for the acquisition of such\\nproperty, such payment to such individual or family shall not exceed\\nfour thousand dollars. Such payment shall be the amount which is\\nnecessary to enable such individual or family to lease or rent for a\\nperiod not to exceed four years, a decent, safe, and sanitary dwelling\\nof standards adequate to accommodate such individual or family in areas\\nnot generally less desirable in regard to public utilities and public\\nand commercial facilities and reasonably accessible to his place of\\nemployment, but shall not exceed four thousand dollars, or to make the\\ndown payment, including reasonable expenses incurred by such individual\\nor family for evidence of title, recording fees, and other closing costs\\nincident to the purchase of the replacement dwelling, but not including\\nprepaid expenses, on the purchase of a decent, safe and sanitary\\ndwelling of standards adequate to accommodate such individual or family\\nin areas not generally less desirable in regard to public utilities and\\npublic and commercial facilities, but shall not exceed four thousand\\ndollars, except if such amount exceeds two thousand dollars, such person\\nmust equally match any such amount in excess of two thousand dollars, in\\nmaking the down payment. Such payments may be made in installments as\\ndetermined by the commissioner. Application for payment under this\\nsubdivision shall be made to the commissioner upon forms prescribed by\\nhim and shall be accompanied by such information and evidence as the\\ncommissioner may require. Upon approval of such application, the\\ncommissioner shall deliver a copy thereof to the comptroller, together\\nwith a certificate stating the amount due thereunder, and the amount so\\nfixed shall be paid out of the state treasury after audit by the\\ncomptroller from moneys appropriated for the acquisition of property\\nunder this section.\\n  11. Any owner may present to the court of claims, pursuant to the\\nprovisions of section five hundred three of the eminent domain procedure\\nlaw, a claim for the value of such property acquired and for legal\\ndamages, as provided by law for the filing of claims with the court of\\nclaims. Awards and judgments of the court of claims shall be paid in the\\nsame manner as awards and judgments of that court for the acquisition of\\nlands generally and shall be paid out of the state treasury from moneys\\nappropriated for purposes connected with elimination of grade crossing\\nprojects.\\n  12. If the work of any grade crossing elimination project shall cause\\nactual damage to property not acquired as provided in this article, the\\nstate shall be liable therefor, but this provision shall not be deemed\\nto create any liability not already existing by statute. Claims for such\\ndamage may be adjusted by the commissioner, if the amounts thereof can\\nbe agreed upon with the persons making such claims, and any amount so\\nagreed upon shall be paid as a part of this cost of such elimination\\nproject. If the amount of any such claim is not agreed upon, such claim\\nmay, pursuant to the provisions of the eminent domain procedure law, be\\npresented to the court of claims which shall hear such claim and\\ndetermine if the amount of such claim or any part thereof is a legal\\nclaim against the state and, if it so determines, to make an award and\\nenter judgment thereon against the state, provided, however, that such\\nclaim is filed with the court of claims within three years after the\\nacceptance by the commissioner of the final agreement of the completed\\nelimination project contract.\\n  13. Notwithstanding any other provision of this article, the\\ncommissioner may acquire by grant or purchase, in the name of the people\\nof the state of New York, any property which he deems necessary for any\\nof the purposes of this chapter, and payment therefor, if any, shall be\\nmade in the manner prescribed in this article for the payment of\\nadjusted acquisition claims, provided, however, that no real property\\nshall be so acquired unless the title thereto shall be approved by the\\nattorney general.\\n  14. The expense of such acquisitions including the cost of making\\nsurveys and preparing descriptions and maps of lands to be acquired and\\nadministrative duties in connection therewith, serving notices of\\nappropriation, publication, making appraisals and agreements and of\\nsearches ordered and examinations and readings of title made by the\\nattorney general, and expenses incurred by the commissioner or attorney\\ngeneral in proceedings for removal of owners and occupants, shall be\\ndeemed part of the cost of such elimination project.\\n  15. Notwithstanding any other law, the commissioner, his officers,\\nagents or contractors when engaged on such elimination projects, may\\npursuant to the provisions of section four hundred four of the eminent\\ndomain procedure law, enter upon property for the purpose of making\\nsurveys, test pits, test borings, or other investigations and also for\\ntemporary occupancy during construction. Claims for any damage caused by\\nsuch entry, work or occupation not exceeding two thousand five hundred\\ndollars may be adjusted by agreement by the commissioner with the owner\\nof the property affected as determined by him by reasonable\\ninvestigation without appropriating such property. Upon making any such\\nadjustment and agreement, the commissioner shall deliver to the\\ncomptroller such agreement and a certificate stating the amount due such\\nowner and the amount so fixed shall be paid out of the state treasury\\nfrom monies appropriated for such elimination project.\\n  16. The commissioner may determine whether any property acquired\\npursuant to this article or grade crossing elimination acts in effect on\\nthe date of enactment of this article for grade crossing elimination\\npurposes may be, in whole or in part, sold or exchanged on terms\\nbeneficial to the state, and in all cases of such determination he may,\\nsubject to the compliance with the provisions of section four hundred\\nsix of the eminent domain procedure law and notwithstanding any other\\nlaw, dispose of such property, provided he shall have first determined\\nthat such property is no longer necessary or useful for the purposes for\\nwhich it was acquired and provided that with respect to crossings where\\naccess is not controlled the disposal of such property shall not deprive\\nan owner of any existing frontage thereon immediately in front of his\\npremises. In order to carry any such sale or exchange into effect the\\ncommissioner may execute and deliver, in the name of the people of the\\nstate, a quitclaim of, or a grant in and to, such property. Each such\\ninstrument of conveyance shall be prepared by the attorney general and,\\nbefore delivery, shall be approved by him as to form and manner of\\nexecution.\\n  18. If subsequent to the acquisition of a temporary easement right in\\nproperty pursuant to this article, the commissioner shall determine; (a)\\nthat the purposes for which such easement right was acquired have been\\naccomplished and that the use and occupancy of said property for such\\npurposes is no longer necessary, or (b) that the period fixed by the\\nterms of such easement for expiration of the same should be further\\nlimited, or (c) if the acquisition of such easement was for an\\nindefinite period, that such period should be fixed and determined, he\\nshall make his certificate to such effect. Upon the expiration of the\\nthen fixed and determined term of the easement, the easement will expire\\nby the terms of the certificate and the affected property will be\\nsurrendered back to the owner, free of such easement, and the easement\\nwill be accordingly thereupon terminated, released and extinguished. The\\ncommissioner shall cause a copy of such certificate to be filed in the\\noffice of the department of state. In the event that the term of a\\ntemporary easement has been fixed at a specific period of time by the\\ndescription and map no further certificate shall be required.\\n  19. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the\\ncommissioner of transportation shall have the power to acquire by grant\\nor purchase, in the name of the people of the state of New York, any\\nproperty which he deems necessary for any of the purposes provided for\\nin this section and may also acquire for such purposes from the\\nPalisades interstate park commission, in the name of the people of the\\nstate of New York, such lands and such easements, licenses, permits and\\nother rights over lands as the said commission is authorized to grant,\\nsell, exchange or convey. When the acquisition by appropriation, grant\\nor purchase of property deemed necessary for grade crossing elimination\\npurposes would result in substantial consequential damages to the\\nowner's remaining property, due to loss of access, severance or control\\nof access, the commissioner of transportation, for and in behalf of the\\npeople of the state of New York, may acquire by purchase or grant all or\\nany portion of such remaining property. Payment therefor, if any, shall\\nbe made in the manner prescribed in this section for the payment of\\nadjusted appropriation claims, provided, however, that no real property\\nshall be so acquired unless the title thereto shall be approved by the\\nattorney general.\\n  20. After acceptance of the completed work, the railroad company shall\\napply to the commissioner for the conveyance to it of any property,\\nacquired as aforesaid, and or any other property owned by the state\\nwhich property is under the jurisdiction of the commissioner and which\\nis used to accomplish a grade crossing elimination, necessary for the\\nproper operation and maintenance of the railroad. If it shall appear to\\nthe commissioner that such application is reasonable and the property is\\nnecessary for the proper operation and maintenance of such railroad and\\nsuch property is not necessary for highway, road or street purposes, the\\ncommissioner shall grant and convey such property to such railroad\\ncompany upon such terms and conditions as he may prescribe.\\n  21. In case any property acquired as aforesaid and not conveyed to a\\nrailroad company physically forms a part of any existing highway, road\\nor street or a new highway, road or street opened to take the place of\\nan existing highway, road or street, the fee title of which existing\\nhighway, road or street is vested in a municipality, such municipality\\nmay apply to the commissioner for a conveyance of such property. The\\ncommissioner may grant and convey such property to such municipality\\nupon such terms and conditions as he may prescribe.\\n  22. Any property acquired as aforesaid and not conveyed to a railroad\\ncompany or a municipality, physically forming a part of any existing or\\nproposed highway, road or street shall become a part of the state,\\ncounty, town, city, village or other highway or street system of which\\nsuch existing or proposed highway, road or street forms a part and shall\\nbe under the jurisdiction of and maintained by the proper authorities\\nhaving charge of such respective systems.\\n  23. If a railroad company has acquired, is acquiring or is about to\\nacquire title to any property in addition to or beyond the normal or\\nreasonable limits of its existing right of way for the operation of the\\nrailroad which the commissioner may deem necessary in the elimination of\\nany crossing, and such property is in the opinion of such commissioner\\nnecessary for the proper operation and maintenance of the railroad of\\nsuch railroad company and not necessary for highway, road or street\\npurposes, same need not be acquired as aforesaid, but may be retained or\\notherwise acquired by such railroad company, in which event such\\nrailroad company shall be compensated for such property in such an\\namount as may be agreed upon by and between such railroad company and\\nthe commissioner. Any amount so agreed upon shall be paid out of the\\nstate treasury from moneys appropriated for purposes connected with\\nelimination of grade crossing projects.\\n  24. In fixing the consideration, if any, to be paid by any railroad\\ncompany or municipality for any property acquired by the people of the\\nstate of New York for an elimination and to be conveyed to such railroad\\ncompany or municipality as prescribed by this article, due regard shall\\nbe given by the commissioner to all facts involved and any other\\nproperty involved in connection with the acquisition of property for\\nsuch elimination and such consideration shall be fixed accordingly. Such\\nconsideration shall be paid to the state and the expenses of the project\\nshall be adjusted to reflect such consideration. Any conveyance of any\\nsuch property shall contain a reservation to the people of the state of\\nNew York of the title to any structures and construction work necessary\\nfor highway, road or street purposes and, also, of the legal right to\\nmaintain same.\\n  25. Any railroad company or its lessee, during the progress of\\nchanging the grade of its railroad under the provisions of this article,\\nis authorized to maintain such temporary structures and to occupy any\\npart or parts of an adjacent street and of intersecting streets as may\\nbe necessary in the premises or for the continued operation of its\\nrailroad and to lay down such temporary tracks on adjacent and\\nintersecting streets as may be necessary for carrying on the railroad\\nbusiness during the progress of the work, all of which shall be done\\nonly with the approval and direction of the commissioner as a part of\\nthe elimination work. If any temporary acquisition of the rights of\\nabutting property owners is made for this purpose the compensation or\\ndamages, if any, paid for such acquisition shall be deemed to be part of\\nthe elimination cost whether paid in the first instance by the railroad\\ncorporation or by the state.\\n  26. Notwithstanding any other provision of law a municipality may\\ngrant a permit to the commissioner to occupy, for grade crossing\\nelimination purposes, any of the property set forth and described on the\\nmaps prescribed by this article which are owned by such municipality.\\nSuch permit may be for permanent or temporary occupancy as shall be\\ndetermined by the commissioner, and the permit shall state the purposes\\nfor which the property is obtained, together with the terms and\\nconditions including payment, if any, which is to be made under the\\npermit. The permit may be in lieu of acquisition of land pursuant to the\\nprovisions of the eminent domain procedure law as provided in this\\narticle. The property described in any such permit may be utilized by\\nthe people of the state of New York, their officers and agents, or by\\nany railroad company to which such permit may be transferred or\\nassigned, for grade crossing elimination purposes. Payment, if any,\\nshall be made by the comptroller and paid out of the state treasury from\\nmoneys appropriated for purposes connected with elimination of grade\\ncrossing projects, after the department of transportation has filed a\\ncopy of the approved permit with the comptroller.\\n  27. The provisions of this article providing for the acquisition and\\ntransfer of property shall apply in all respects to the acquisition and\\ntransfer of property necessary for those incidental improvements held\\nnecessary or desirable because of the elimination project.\\n  28. Notwithstanding any other provisions of law, the commissioner may\\nuse, for grade crossing elimination purposes, any property under his\\njurisdiction acquired for other public purposes which he deems\\nnecessary, exclusively for, or in conjunction with grade crossing\\nelimination purposes. Transfer of such use shall be effected by an\\nofficial order of the commissioner to be filed in the offices of the\\ndepartment and of the department of state, accompanied by a description\\nand map of such property.
