If\\nthe commissioner determines to appoint a temporary operator, the\\ncommissioner shall notify the established operator and the local social\\nservices district of his or her intention to appoint a temporary\\noperator to assume sole responsibility for the provider of the emergency\\nshelter's operations for a limited period of time. The appointment of a\\ntemporary operator shall be effectuated pursuant to this section, and\\nshall be in addition to any other remedies provided by law.\\n  (ii) The established operator may at any time request the commissioner\\nto appoint a temporary operator. Upon receiving such a request, the\\ncommissioner may, if he or she determines that such an action is\\nnecessary, enter into an agreement with the established operator for the\\nappointment of a temporary operator to restore or maintain the provision\\nof quality emergency shelter to the emergency shelter residents until\\nthe established operator can resume operations within the designated\\ntime period or other action is taken to suspend, revoke, or limit the\\nauthority of the established operator.\\n  (3) (i) A temporary operator appointed pursuant to this section shall\\nuse his or her best efforts to implement the plan deemed satisfactory by\\nthe commissioner to correct or eliminate any deficiencies in the\\nbuilding and to promote the quality and accessibility of the emergency\\nshelter in the community served by the provider of emergency shelter.\\n  (ii) During the term of appointment, the temporary operator shall have\\nthe authority to direct the staff of the established operator as\\nnecessary to appropriately provide emergency shelter for homeless\\nindividuals and families.

After ninety days, if the commissioner\\ndetermines that termination of the temporary operator would cause\\nsignificant deterioration of the quality of, or access to, emergency\\nshelter in the community or that reappointment is necessary to correct\\nthe deficiencies that required the appointment of the temporary\\noperator, the commissioner may authorize an additional ninety-day term.\\nHowever, such authorization shall include the commissioner's\\nrequirements for conclusion of the temporary operatorship to be\\nsatisfied within the additional term.\\n  (ii) Within fourteen days prior to the termination of each term of the\\nappointment of the temporary operator, the temporary operator shall\\nsubmit to the commissioner, to the local social services district, and\\nto the established operator a report describing:\\n  (A) the actions taken during the appointment to address the identified\\nbuilding deficiencies, the resumption of building operations by the\\nestablished operator, or the revocation of authority to operate an\\nemergency shelter;\\n  (B) objectives for the continuation of the temporary operatorship if\\nnecessary and a schedule for satisfaction of such objectives; and\\n  (C) if applicable, the recommended actions for the ongoing provision\\nof emergency shelter subsequent to the temporary operatorship.\\n  (iii) The term of the initial appointment and of any subsequent\\nreappointment may be terminated prior to the expiration of the\\ndesignated term, if the established operator and the commissioner agree\\non a plan of correction and the implementation of such plan.\\n  (6) (i) The commissioner shall, upon making a determination of an\\nintention to appoint a temporary operator pursuant to subparagraph (i)\\nof paragraph two of this subdivision, cause the established operator and\\nthe local social services district to be notified of the intention by\\nregistered or certified mail addressed to the principal office of the\\nestablished operator and the local social services district. Such\\nnotification shall include a detailed description of the findings\\nunderlying the intention to appoint a temporary operator, and the date\\nand time of a required meeting with the commissioner within ten business\\ndays of the receipt of such notice. At such meeting, the established\\noperator, and the commissioner shall have the opportunity to review and\\ndiscuss all relevant findings. At such meeting, the commissioner and the\\nestablished operator shall attempt to develop a mutually satisfactory\\nplan of correction and schedule for implementation. If a mutually\\nsatisfactory plan of correction and schedule for implementation is\\ndeveloped, the commissioner shall notify the established operator that\\nthe commissioner will abstain from appointing a temporary operator\\ncontingent upon the established operator remediating the identified\\ndeficiencies within the agreed upon timeframe.\\n  (ii) The commissioner shall, upon making a determination of an\\nintention to appoint a temporary operator pursuant to subparagraph (i)\\nof paragraph two of this subdivision, cause the temporary president of\\nthe senate, and the speaker of the assembly to receive appropriate and\\ntimely notification of the intention to appoint a temporary operator.\\nSuch notification shall include a description of the findings underlying\\nthe intention to appoint a temporary operator, the identification of the\\nnew operator when practicable, and the date of expected transfer of\\noperations. Such notice shall be made as soon as practicable under the\\ncircumstances.\\n  (iii) The commissioner, at any time he or she deems necessary and to\\nthe extent practicable, shall consult and may involve the local social\\nservices district.\\n  (iv) Should the commissioner and the established operator be unable to\\nestablish a plan of correction pursuant to subparagraph (i) of this\\nparagraph, or should the established operator fail to respond to the\\ncommissioner's initial notification, there shall be an administrative\\nhearing on the commissioner's determination to appoint a temporary\\noperator to begin no later than thirty days from the date of the notice\\nto the established operator. Any such hearing shall be strictly limited\\nto the issue of whether the determination of the commissioner to appoint\\na temporary operator is supported by substantial evidence. A copy of the\\ndecision shall be sent to the established operator and the local social\\nservices district.\\n  (v) If the decision to appoint a temporary operator is upheld such\\ntemporary operator shall be appointed as soon as is practicable and\\nshall provide emergency shelter pursuant to the provisions of this\\nsection.\\n  (7) Notwithstanding the appointment of a temporary operator, the\\nestablished operator shall remain obligated for the continued provision\\nof emergency shelter. No provision contained in this section shall be\\ndeemed to relieve the established operator or any other person of any\\ncivil or criminal liability incurred, or any duty imposed by law, by\\nreason of acts or omissions of the established operator or any other\\nperson prior to the appointment of any temporary operator of the\\nbuilding hereunder; nor shall anything contained in this section be\\nconstrued to suspend during the term of the appointment of the temporary\\noperator of the building any obligation of the established operator or\\nany other person for the maintenance and repair of the building,\\nprovision of utility services, payment of taxes or other operating and\\nmaintenance expenses of the building, nor of the established operator or\\nany other person for the payment of mortgages or liens.\\n  * NB Repealed March 31, 2022\\n  * (k) exercise such other powers and perform such other duties as may\\nbe imposed by law.\\n  * NB Repealed March 31, 2022\\n",

The commissioner,\\nwhen an appropriation therefor has been made by the legislature, may\\nacquire any real property which he may deem necessary for any\\ndepartmental purpose by purchase or, in the manner provided in the\\neminent domain procedure law.  Title to any such real property shall be\\ntaken in the name of and be vested in the people of the state of New\\nYork; provided, however, that no real property shall be so acquired by\\npurchase unless the title thereto shall be approved by the attorney\\ngeneral.\\n  2.  Whenever real property is to be acquired pursuant to the eminent\\ndomain procedure law, the commissioner shall cause to be made by the\\nstate department of transportation an accurate acquisition map as so\\nprovided in such law.\\n  3. On the approval of such map by the commissioner, the original\\ntracing of such map shall be filed in the main office of the department\\npursuant to the eminent domain procedure law.\\n  4. If the commissioner shall determine, prior to the filing of such\\nmap in the office of the clerk or register of the county, that changes,\\nalterations or modifications of such map as filed in the office of the\\ndepartment should be made, he or she shall, subject to the provisions of\\narticle two of the eminent domain procedure law, if applicable, direct\\nthe preparation by the department of transportation of an amended map.\\nOn the approval of such amended map by the commissioner, it shall be\\nfiled in the main office of the department and the amended map shall\\nthereupon in all respects and for all purposes supersede the map\\npreviously filed.\\n  5. If the commissioner shall determine, prior to the filing of a copy\\nof such acquisition map in the office of the county clerk or register as\\nprovided in paragraph three of subdivision (A) of section four hundred\\ntwo of the eminent domain procedure law, that such map should be\\nwithdrawn, he or she may file a certificate of withdrawal in the offices\\nof the department and of the department of law. Upon the filing of such\\ncertificate of withdrawal, the map to which it refers shall be\\ncancelled, and all rights thereunder shall cease and determine.\\n  6.  The commissioner shall deliver to the attorney general a copy of\\nsuch acquisition map, whereupon it shall be the duty of the attorney\\ngeneral to advise and certify to the commissioner the names of the\\nowners of the property, easements, interests or rights described in the\\nsaid acquisition map, including the owners of any right, title or\\ninterest therein, pursuant to the requirements of section four hundred\\nthree of the eminent domain procedure law.\\n  7.  If, at or after the vesting of title to such property in the\\npeople of the state of New York as provided for in the eminent domain\\nprocedure law, the commissioner shall deem it necessary to cause the\\nremoval of an owner or occupancy from any real property so acquired, he\\nmay cause such owner or occupant to be removed therefrom by proceeding\\nin accordance with section four hundred five of the eminent domain\\nprocedure law.  The proceeding shall be brought in the name of the\\ncommissioner as agent of the state and the attorney general shall\\nrepresent the petitioner in the proceedings.  No execution shall issue\\nfor costs, if any, awarded against the state or the commissioner, but\\nthey shall be part of the costs of the acquisition of the real property\\nand be paid in like manner.  Proceedings may be brought separately\\nagainst one or more of the owners or occupants of any such property, or\\none proceeding may be brought against all or several of the owners or\\noccupants of any or all such property within the territorial\\njurisdiction of the same court, justice or judge; judgment shall be made\\nfor immediate removal of persons defaulting in appearance or in\\nanswering, or withdrawing their answers, if any, without awaiting the\\ntrial or decision of issues raised by contestants, if any.\\n  8.  Upon making any agreement provided for in section three hundred\\nfour of the eminent domain procedure law, the commissioner shall deliver\\nto the comptroller such agreement and a certificate stating the amount\\ndue such owner or owners thereunder on account of such acquisition of\\nhis or their property and the amounts so fixed shall be paid out of the\\nstate treasury after audit by the comptroller from moneys appropriated\\nfor the acquisition of such real property, but not until there shall\\nhave been filed with the comptroller a certificate of the attorney\\ngeneral showing the person or persons claiming the amount so agreed upon\\nto be legally entitled thereto.\\n  9.  Application for reimbursement of incidental expenses as provided\\nin section seven hundred two of the eminent domain procedure law shall\\nbe made to the commissioner upon forms prescribed by him and shall be\\naccompanied by such information and evidence as the commissioner may\\nrequire.  Upon approval of such application, the commissioner shall\\ndeliver a copy thereof to the comptroller together with a certificate\\nstating the amount due thereof, and the amount so fixed shall be paid\\nout of the state treasury after audit by the comptroller from monies\\nappropriated for the acquisition of property under this section.\\n  10.  The commissioner, with the approval of the director of the\\nbudget, shall establish and may from time to time amend rules and\\nregulations authorizing the payment of actual reasonable and necessary\\nmoving expenses of occupants of property acquired pursuant to this\\nsection;  of actual direct losses of tangible personal property as a\\nresult of moving or discontinuing a business or farm operation, but not\\nexceeding an amount equal to the reasonable expenses that would have\\nbeen required to relocate such property, as determined by the\\ncommissioner; and actual reasonable expenses in searching for a\\nreplacement business or farm; or in hardship cases for the advance\\npayment of such expenses and losses.  For the purposes of making payment\\nof such expenses and losses only the term \"business\" means any lawful\\nactivity conducted primarily for assisting in the purchase, sale,\\nresale, manufacture, processing or marketing of products, commodities,\\npersonal property or services by the erection and maintenance of an\\noutdoor advertising display or displays, whether or not such display or\\ndisplays are located on the premises on which any of the above\\nactivities are conducted.  Such rules and regulations may further define\\nthe terms used in this subdivision.  In lieu of such actual reasonable\\nand necessary moving expenses, any such displaced owner or tenant of\\nresidential property may elect to accept a moving expense allowance,\\nplus a dislocation allowance, determined in accordance with a schedule\\nprepared by the commissioner and made a part of such rules and\\nregulations.  In lieu of such actual reasonable and necessary moving\\nexpenses, any such displaced owner or tenant of commercial property who\\nrelocates or discontinues his business or farm operation may elect to\\naccept a fixed relocation payment in an amount equal to the average\\nannual net earnings of the business or farm operation, except that such\\npayment shall be not less than two thousand five hundred dollars nor\\nmore than ten thousand dollars.  In the case of a business, no such\\nfixed relocation payment shall be made unless the commissioner finds and\\ndetermines that the business cannot be relocated without a substantial\\nloss of its existing patronage, and that the business is not part of a\\ncommercial enterprise having at least one other establishment, which is\\nnot being acquired by the state or the United States, which is engaged\\nin the same or similar business.  In the case of a business which is to\\nbe discontinued but for which the findings and determinations set forth\\nabove cannot be made, the commissioner may prepare an estimate of what\\nthe actual reasonable and necessary moving expenses, exclusive of any\\nstorage charges, would be if the business were to be relocated and enter\\ninto an agreed settlement with the owner of such business for an amount\\nnot to exceed such estimate in lieu of such actual reasonable and\\nnecessary moving expenses.  Application for payment under this\\nsubdivision shall be made to the commissioner upon forms prescribed by\\nhim and shall be accompanied by such information and evidence as the\\ncommissioner may require.  Upon approval of such application, the\\ncommissioner shall deliver a copy thereof to the comptroller together\\nwith a certificate stating the amount due thereunder, and the amount so\\nfixed shall be paid out of the state treasury after audit by the\\ncomptroller from moneys appropriated for the acquisition of property\\nunder this section.  As used in this subdivision the term \"commercial\\nproperty\" shall include property owned by an individual, family,\\npartnership, corporation, association or a nonprofit organization and\\nincludes a farm operation.  As used in this subdivision the term\\n\"business\" means any lawful activity, except a farm operation, conducted\\nprimarily for the purchase, sale, lease and rental of personal and real\\nproperty, and for the manufacture, processing, or marketing of products,\\ncommodities, or any other personal property; for the sale of services to\\nthe public; or by a nonprofit organization.\\n  11.  Authorization is hereby given to the commissioner to make\\nsupplemental relocation payments, separately computed and stated, to\\ndisplaced owners and tenants of residential property acquired pursuant\\nto this section who are entitled thereto, as determined by him.  The\\ncommissioner, with the approval of the director of the budget, may\\nestablish and from time to time amend rules and regulations providing\\nfor such supplemental relocation payments.  Such rules and regulations\\nmay further define the terms used in this subdivision.  In the case of\\nproperty acquired pursuant to this section which is improved by a\\ndwelling actually owned and occupied by the displaced owner for not less\\nthan one hundred eighty days immediately prior to initiation of\\nnegotiations for the acquisition of such property, such payment to such\\nowner shall not exceed fifteen thousand dollars.  Such payment shall be\\nthe amount, if any, which, when added to the acquisition payment equals\\nthe average price, established by the commissioner on a class, group or\\nindividual basis, required to obtain a comparable replacement dwelling\\nthat is decent, safe and sanitary to accommodate the displaced owner,\\nreasonably accessible to public services and places of employment and\\navailable on the private market, but in no event shall such payment\\nexceed the difference between acquisition payment and the actual\\npurchase price of the replacement dwelling.  Such payment shall include\\nan amount which will compensate such displaced owner for any increased\\ninterest costs which such person is required to pay for financing the\\nacquisition of any such comparable replacement dwelling.  Such amount\\nshall be paid only if the dwelling acquired pursuant to this section was\\nencumbered by a bona fide mortgage which was a valid lien on such\\ndwelling for not less than one hundred eighty days prior to the\\ninitiation of negotiations for the acquisition of such dwelling.  Such\\namount shall be equal to the excess in the aggregate interest and other\\ndebt service costs of that amount of the principal of the mortgage on\\nthe replacement dwelling which is equal to the unpaid balance of the\\nmortgage on the acquired dwelling, over the remainder term of the\\nmortgage on the acquired dwelling, reduced to discounted present value.\\nThe discount rate shall be the prevailing interest rate paid on savings\\ndeposits by commercial banks in the general area in which the\\nreplacement dwelling is located.  Any such mortgage interest\\ndifferential payment shall, notwithstanding the provisions of section\\ntwenty-six-b of the general construction law, be in lieu of and in full\\nsatisfaction of the requirements of such section.  Such payment shall\\ninclude reasonable expenses incurred by such displaced owner for\\nevidence of title, recording fees and other closing costs incident to\\nthe purchase of the replacement dwelling, but not including prepaid\\nexpenses.  Such payment shall be made only to a displaced owner who\\npurchases and occupies a replacement dwelling which is decent, safe and\\nsanitary within one year subsequent to the date on which he is required\\nto move from the dwelling acquired pursuant to this section or the date\\non which he receives from the state final payment of all costs of the\\nacquired dwelling, whichever occurs later, except advance payment of\\nsuch amount may be made in hardship cases.  In the case of property\\nacquired pursuant to this section from which an individual or family,\\nnot otherwise eligible to receive a payment pursuant to the above\\nprovisions of this subdivision, is displaced from any dwelling thereon\\nwhich has been actually and lawfully occupied by such individual or\\nfamily for not less than ninety days immediately prior to the initiation\\nof negotiations for the acquisition of such property, such payment to\\nsuch individual or family shall not exceed four thousand dollars.  Such\\npayment shall be the amount which is necessary to enable such individual\\nor family to lease or rent for a period not to exceed four years, a\\ndecent, safe, and sanitary dwelling of standards adequate to accommodate\\nsuch individual or family in areas not generally less desirable in\\nregard to public utilities and public and commercial facilities and\\nreasonably accesible to his place of employment, but shall not exceed\\nfour thousand dollars, or to make the down payment, including reasonable\\nexpenses incurred by such individual or family for evidence of title,\\nrecording fees, and other closing costs incident to the purchase of the\\nreplacement dwelling, but not including prepaid expenses, on the\\npurchase of a decent, safe and sanitary dwelling of standards adequate\\nto accommodate such individual or family in areas not generally less\\ndesirable in regard to public utilities and public and commercial\\nfacilities, but shall not exceed four thousand dollars, except if such\\namount exceeds two thousand dollars, such person must equally match any\\nsuch amount in excess of two thousand dollars, in making the down\\npayment.  Such payments may be made in installments as determined by the\\ncommissioner.  Application for payment under this subdivision shall be\\nmade to the commissioner upon forms prescribed by him and shall be\\naccompanied by such information and evidence as the commissioner may\\nrequire.  Upon approval of such application, the commissioner shall\\ndeliver a copy thereof to the comptroller, together with a certificate\\nstating the amount due thereunder, and the amount so fixed shall be paid\\nout of the state treasury after audit by the comptroller from moneys\\nappropriated for the acquisition of property under this section.\\n  12. The owner of any real property so acquired may present to the\\ncourt of claims, pursuant to subdivision (A) of section five hundred\\nthree of the eminent domain procedure law, a claim for the value of such\\nproperty and for other legal damages as provided by law for the filing\\nof claims with the court of claims.  Awards and judgments of the court\\nof claims shall be paid in the same manner as awards and judgments of\\nthat court for the acquisition of lands generally and shall be paid out\\nof the state treasury after audit by the comptroller from moneys\\nappropriated for the acquisition of such real property.\\n  13.  Expenses incurred in the acquisition of the property, including\\nthe cost of title searches, service and publication of notices, and\\nexpenses incurred in proceedings for the removal of owners or occupants,\\nshall be deemed to be part of the cost of the acquisition of such real\\nproperty and shall be paid accordingly out of any moneys appropriated\\nfor the acquisition of such property.\\n  14.  If the commissioner shall determine subsequent to the acquisition\\nof a temporary easement in any real property that the purposes for which\\nsuch easement right was acquired have been accomplished and that the\\nexercise of such easement is no longer necessary, he shall make his\\ncertificate that the exercise of such easement is no longer necessary\\nand that such easement right is therefore terminated, released and\\nextinguished.  The commissioner shall cause such certificate to be filed\\nin the office of the department of state and upon such filing all rights\\nacquired by the state in such property shall cease and determine.  The\\ncommissioner shall cause a certified copy of such certificate as so\\nfiled in the office of the department of state to be mailed to the owner\\nof the property affected, as certified by the attorney general, if the\\nplace of residence of such owner is known or can be ascertained by a\\nreasonable effort and such commissioner shall cause a further certified\\ncopy of such certificate to be filed in the office of the recording\\nofficer of each county in which the property affected or any part\\nthereof is situated.  On the filing of such certified copy of such\\ncertificate with such recording officer, it shall be his duty to record\\nthe same in his office in the books used for recording deeds and to\\nindex the same against the name of the people of the state of New York\\nas grantor.\\n",

The legislature,\\ntherefore, finds that a special fund should be established, to fund\\ncapital programs sponsored by not-for-profit corporations, charitable\\norganizations, wholly owned subsidiaries of not-for-profit corporations\\nor of charitable organizations, public corporations and municipalities\\nthat will expand and improve the supply of shelter and other housing\\narrangements for homeless persons.\\n",

After the\\ndeath of such person the lien may not be enforced against real property\\nwhile it is occupied by the surviving spouse.\\n  7. The sale of any parcel of real property or mortgage on real\\nproperty by the social services official, under the provisions of this\\nsection, shall be made at a public sale, held at least two weeks after\\nnotice thereof shall have been published in a newspaper having a general\\ncirculation in that section of the county in which the real property is\\nlocated. Such notice shall specify the time and place of such public\\nsale and shall contain a brief description of the premises to be sold,\\nor upon which the mortgage is a lien, as the case may be. Unless in the\\njudgment of the social services official, it shall be in the public\\ninterest to reject all bids, such parcel or mortgage shall be sold to\\nthe highest responsible bidder.\\n  8. It is permissible for social services officials to subordinate a\\nmortgage taken on behalf of the social services district pursuant to\\nthis section. In the event that a social services official determines to\\nsubordinate a mortgage, or lien, he or she shall do so within thirty\\ndays of receipt of written notice that the mortgagor is attempting to\\nmodify their mortgage that is held by a mortgagee with superior lien\\nrights and subordination of the social services district's mortgage is\\nrequired by such mortgagee in order for it to approve or complete the\\nmodification.\\n",

The notice shall state that the\\nattorney initiating the proceeding represents the department.\\n  3. In appropriate cases, the department is authorized to utilize\\nsupport enforcement and collection and location services made available\\nthrough the secretary of health and human services, including the\\nservices of federal courts, the federal parent locator service, the\\nfederal case registry of child support orders, the national directory of\\nnew hires, and the treasury department, if and so long as authorized and\\nrequired by federal law.\\n  4.

The commissioner shall, subject to the\\napproval of the director of the budget, annually allocate a portion of\\nthe statewide goal to each social services district, which portion shall\\nbe based upon the district's portion of the statewide aid to dependent\\nchildren program and other relevant factors.\\n  (b) Notwithstanding any inconsistent provision of section one hundred\\nfifty-three of this chapter, for each social services district which\\nfails to meet its portion of the collection goal established by this\\nsection, the commissioner shall deny state reimbursement for such\\ndistrict's expenditures for aid to dependent children, in an amount\\nequal to the difference between the amount of non-federal funds such\\ndistrict is required to repay to the state out of collections actually\\nmade and the amount of non-federal funds such district would have been\\nrequired to repay to the state had it met its collection goal.\\n  (c) Any social services district which has been determined to have\\nfailed to meet its portion of the collection goal may request a\\nredetermination by the commissioner or his designee in a manner to be\\nestablished by department regulations. Upon a showing by such district\\nthat such failure was due in whole or in part to factors other than\\nthose administrative and processing functions or organizations which are\\nsubject to the jurisdiction of such district's local legislative body,\\nthe commissioner shall waive such failure in whole or in part and shall\\nrestore all or a corresponding portion of any state reimbursement\\npreviously denied pursuant to this section.\\n  (d) For purposes of determining the amount of child support\\ncollections which are attributable toward meeting a district's portion\\nof the statewide collections goal, any amounts collected by one social\\nservices district on behalf of another shall be credited to the district\\nto which support payments have been assigned. Support payments collected\\non behalf of another state or on behalf of persons not in receipt of aid\\nto dependent children shall not be taken into consideration in\\ndetermining whether such district has met its goal.\\n  (e) The department may for purposes of administrative convenience set\\nmonthly or quarterly goals based upon each district's annual goal and\\nmay deny reimbursement on a monthly or quarterly basis, subject to a\\nfinal adjustment at the end of each year reflecting the extent to which\\neach such district has met its portion of the statewide annual goal.\\n  6. When the commissioner has determined that a social services\\ndistrict has failed to meet its portion of the statewide child support\\ncollections goal, as determined in accordance with the provisions of\\nsubdivision five of this section, or has failed to comply with the\\napplicable provisions of federal law and regulations, he shall notify\\nsuch district and the appropriate local legislative body of such\\ndetermination and may promulgate any regulations he determines are\\nnecessary to improve such district's organization, administration,\\nmanagement or program. Such regulations shall be fully complied with by\\nthe effective date of such regulations.\\n  7. The department, through the commissioner, shall enter into the\\nagreement provided for in section one hundred seventy-one-c of the tax\\nlaw and is authorized to furnish to the commissioner of taxation and\\nfinance and the state tax commission such information and to take such\\nother actions as may be necessary to carry out the agreement provided\\nfor in such section, for the crediting of overpayments of tax to\\npast-due support which is owed to persons receiving services pursuant to\\nthis title and title six-B of this article. A person receiving services\\nunder this title shall receive a pro rata share of the overpayment of\\ntax, based on the amount of past-due support owed to such person as\\ncertified to the tax commission by the department pursuant to section\\none hundred seventy-one-c of the tax law, in cases where the individual,\\nestate or trust owing past-due support to such person owes past-due\\nsupport to other persons or entities so certified to the tax commission\\nby the department.

(a) The department, through the commissioner, shall enter into\\nthe agreement provided for in section sixteen hundred thirteen-a of the\\ntax law and is authorized to furnish to the director of the lottery and\\nthe division of the lottery such information and to take such other\\nactions as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of the agreement\\nprovided for in such section, for the crediting of lottery prizes of six\\nhundred dollars or more to past-due support which is owed to persons\\nreceiving services pursuant to this title. A person receiving services\\nunder this title shall receive a pro rata share of the prize winning\\nbased on the amount of past-due support owed to such person as provided\\nto the division of the lottery by the department pursuant to section\\nsixteen hundred thirteen-a of the tax law, in cases where the\\nindividual, estate or trust owing past-due support to such person owes\\npast-due support to other persons or entities so provided to the\\ndivision of the lottery by the department.

The amount paid by the state comptroller\\nto the department pursuant to subdivision one of section sixteen hundred\\nthirteen-a of the tax law shall be distributed in accordance with\\napplicable provisions of this chapter and the department's regulations.\\n  (b) The department shall by regulation establish procedures by which\\nany individual, estate or trust which is the subject of crediting of any\\nlottery prize of six hundred dollars or more to the state division of\\nthe lottery in accordance with such agreement may contest such crediting\\nbased on defenses that are not subject to family court jurisdiction.\\nSuch regulations shall require that notice be given to the individual,\\nestate or trust which shall set forth:\\n  (i) defenses which may be available to the individual, estate or trust\\nto contest such crediting;\\n  (ii) the manner in which a review of the crediting of lottery prizes\\nof six hundred dollars or more based on such defenses may be obtained;\\n  (iii) the address and telephone number of the local department of\\nsocial services' support collection unit which may be contacted with\\nrespect to correction of any error in such crediting concerning such\\nindividual's, estate's or trust's liability for past-due support or with\\nrespect to payment of such liability; and\\n  (iv) the time frame by which such a defense must be made.\\n  * NB There are 2 sb 10's\\n  * 10. The commissioner must review the child support standards act at\\nleast once every four years to ensure that its application results in\\nthe determination of appropriate child support amounts. As part of such\\nreview, the commissioner must consider economic data on the cost of\\nraising children and analyze case data, gathered through sampling or\\nother methods, on the application of, and deviations from the basic\\nchild support obligation. The analysis of the data must be used to\\nensure that such deviations are limited and, if appropriate, necessary\\nrevisions to the child support standards act must be submitted to the\\nlegislature to accomplish such purpose.\\n  * NB There are 2 sb 10's\\n  11. (a) Amounts certified to the division of the lottery under the\\nagreement described in subdivision ten of this section for persons who\\nare receiving services pursuant to this title may include:\\n  (i) amounts representing delinquencies which have accrued under a\\ncourt order of support;\\n  (ii) with respect to any court order of support made which establishes\\nan arrears amount, the entire amount of such arrears.\\n  (b) For the purpose of the state child support program any payment\\nmade by a respondent which is insufficient to fully satisfy both a\\ncurrent court order of support and a periodic payment toward the balance\\nof any arrears amount established by court order shall be first applied\\ntoward the current order of support or any delinquency thereon and then\\ntoward the periodic payment on any arrears amount established by court\\norder unless otherwise required by federal regulation.\\n  * 12. (a) The department, through the commissioner, shall enter into\\nthe agreement provided for in section five hundred ten of the vehicle\\nand traffic law and is authorized to furnish to the commissioner of\\nmotor vehicles such information and to take such actions as may be\\nnecessary to carry out the agreement provided for in such section, for\\nthe enforcement of child support orders through the suspension of\\ndelinquent obligors' driving privileges.\\n  (b) (1) When a support obligor who is or was under a court order to\\npay child support or combined child and spousal support to a support\\ncollection unit on behalf of persons receiving services under this title\\nhas accumulated support arrears equivalent to or greater than the amount\\nof support due pursuant to such order for a period of four months, the\\noffice of temporary and disability assistance shall notify the support\\nobligor in writing that his or her continued failure to pay the support\\narrears shall result in notification to the department of motor vehicles\\nto suspend the support obligor's driving privileges unless the support\\nobligor complies with the requirements set forth in paragraph (e) of\\nthis subdivision.

A social services\\nofficial or his or her designated representative who confers with a\\npotential respondent or respondent, hereinafter referred to in this\\nsection as the \"respondent\", the mother of a child born out of wedlock\\nand any other interested persons, pursuant to section one hundred\\neleven-c of this title, may obtain:\\n  (a) an acknowledgment of paternity of a child, as provided for in\\narticle five-B or section five hundred sixteen-a of the family court\\nact, by a written statement, witnessed by two people not related to the\\nsignator or as provided for in section four thousand one hundred\\nthirty-five-b of the public health law. Prior to the execution of such\\nacknowledgment by the child's mother and the respondent, they shall be\\nadvised, orally, which may be through the use of audio or video\\nequipment, and in writing, of the consequences of making such an\\nacknowledgment. Upon the signing of an acknowledgment of paternity\\npursuant to this section, the social services official or his or her\\nrepresentative shall file the original acknowledgment with the\\nregistrar.\\n  (b) an agreement to make support payments as provided in section four\\nhundred twenty-five of the family court act. Prior to the execution of\\nsuch agreement, the respondent shall be advised, orally, which may be\\nthrough the use of audio or video equipment, and in writing, of the\\nconsequences of such agreement, that the respondent can be held liable\\nfor support only if the family court, after a hearing, makes an order of\\nsupport; that respondent has a right to consult with an attorney and\\nthat the agreement will be submitted to the family court for approval\\npursuant to section four hundred twenty-five of the family court act;\\nand that by executing the agreement, the respondent waives any right to\\na hearing regarding any matter contained in such agreement.\\n  2. (a) When the paternity of a child is contested, a social services\\nofficial or designated representative may order the mother, the child,\\nand the alleged father to submit to one or more genetic marker or DNA\\ntests of a type generally acknowledged as reliable by an accreditation\\nbody designated by the secretary of the federal department of health and\\nhuman services and performed by a laboratory approved by such an\\naccreditation body and by the commissioner of health or by a duly\\nqualified physician to aid in the determination of whether or not the\\nalleged father is the father of the child.  The order may be issued\\nprior or subsequent to the filing of a petition with the court to\\nestablish paternity, shall be served on the parties by certified mail,\\nand shall include a sworn statement which either (i) alleges paternity\\nand sets forth facts establishing a reasonable possibility of the\\nrequisite sexual contact between the parties, or (ii) denies paternity\\nand sets forth facts establishing a reasonable possibility that the\\nparty is not the father.  The parties shall not be required to submit to\\nthe administration and analysis of such tests if they sign a voluntary\\nacknowledgment of paternity in accordance with paragraph (a) of\\nsubdivision one of this section, or if there has been a written finding\\nby the court that it is not in the best interests of the child on the\\nbasis of res judicata, equitable estoppel or the presumption of\\nlegitimacy of a child born to a married woman.\\n  (b) The record or report of the results of any such genetic marker or\\nDNA test may be submitted to the family court as evidence pursuant to\\nsubdivision (e) of rule forty-five hundred eighteen of the civil\\npractice law and rules where no timely objection in writing has been\\nmade thereto.\\n  (c) The cost of any test ordered pursuant to this section shall be\\npaid by the social services district provided however, that the alleged\\nfather shall reimburse the district for the cost of such test at such\\ntime as the alleged father's paternity is established by a voluntary\\nacknowledgment of paternity or an order of filiation. If either party\\ncontests the results of genetic marker or DNA tests, an additional test\\nmay be ordered upon written request to the social services district and\\nadvance payment by the requesting party.\\n  (d) The parties shall be required to submit to such tests and appear\\nat any conference scheduled by the social services official or designee\\nto discuss the notice of the allegation of paternity or to discuss the\\nresults of such tests.  If the alleged father fails to appear at any\\nsuch conference or fails to submit to such genetic marker or DNA tests,\\nthe social services official or designee shall petition the court to\\nestablish paternity, provide the court with a copy of the records or\\nreports of such tests if any, and request the court to issue an order\\nfor temporary support pursuant to section five hundred forty-two of the\\nfamily court act.\\n",

A facility shall not demand, require or contract for payment of\\nall or any part of the personal allowance in satisfaction of the\\nfacility rate for supplies and services and shall not charge the\\nindividual or the account for any supplies or services that the facility\\nis by law, regulation or agreement with the individual required to\\nprovide or for any medical supplies or services for which payment is\\navailable under medical assistance, pursuant to this title, medicare\\npursuant to title XVIII of the federal social security act, or any third\\nparty coverage. Any service or supplies provided by the facility,\\ncharged to the individual or the account shall be provided only with the\\nspecific consent of the individual, who shall be furnished in advance of\\nthe provision of the services or supplies with an itemized statement\\nsetting forth the charges for the services or supplies. Whenever a\\nresident authorizes an operator of a facility to exercise control over\\nhis or her personal allowance such authorization shall be in writing and\\nsubscribed by the parties to be charged. Any such money shall not be\\nmingled with the funds or become an asset of the facility or the person\\nreceiving the same, but shall be segregated and recorded on the\\nfacility's financial records as independent accounts.\\n  3. Any individual who has not received or been able to control\\npersonal allowance funds to the extent and in the manner required by\\nthis section may maintain an action in his own behalf for recovery of\\nany such funds, and upon a showing that the funds were intentionally\\nmisappropriated or withheld to other than the intended use, for recovery\\nof additional punitive damages in an amount equal to twice the amount\\nmisappropriated or withheld. The department may investigate any\\nsuspected misappropriation or withholding of personal allowance funds\\nand may maintain an action on behalf of any individual to recover any\\nfunds so misappropriated, including any punitive damages. Any funds\\nobtained as a result of such an action shall be disregarded in\\ndetermining such individual's eligibility for or amount of benefits\\navailable pursuant to this chapter, to the extent permitted by federal\\nlaw and regulation.\\n  4. Each facility subject to the provisions of this section shall\\nmaintain in accordance with department regulations complete records and\\ndocumentation of all transactions involving resident personal allowance\\naccounts, and shall make such records available to the department and to\\nany other agency responsible for the inspection and supervision of the\\nfacility upon request, with respect to any individual who is receiving\\nadditional state payments.\\n  5. Any agency having supervisory responsibilities over any facility\\nsubject to the provisions of this section shall, at the time of any\\ninspection of such a facility, inquire into the furnishing of and\\naccounting for resident personal allowances, and shall report any\\nviolations or suspected violations of this section to the department.\\nThe department shall have primary responsibility for monitoring the\\npersonal allowance requirements of this section; provided, however, that\\nthe department may by cooperative agreement delegate such monitoring and\\nenforcement functions, in whole or in part, with respect to any\\nfacility, to any other state agency having supervisory responsibilities\\nover such facility.\\n  6. At the time an individual ceases to be a resident at the facility\\nmaintaining a resident personal allowance account on his behalf, the\\nfunds in such account shall be transferred to such individual or another\\nappropriate individual or agency for use on his behalf, in accordance\\nwith department regulations.\\n  7. Any facility subject to the provisions of this section shall assure\\nthat any income of an individual residing therein that not considered in\\ndetermining such individual's eligibility for or amount of benefits\\nunder the program of additional state payments pursuant to title six of\\narticle five of this chapter, other than unearned income paid from\\nnon-public sources for the purpose of meeting the cost, in part or in\\nwhole, of such person's care and maintenance in such a facility, is\\ntreated in the same manner as the personal allowance required to be made\\navailable to the individual pursuant to this section.\\n  8. In any case in which a person receives a payment of additional\\nstate payment benefits for a month other than the month in which the\\npayment is received, the full monthly personal allowance for the months\\nto which the payment is attributable shall be made available to the\\nindividual at such time as the payment has been received; in no event\\nshall the facility be found to have failed to comply with the provisions\\nof this section solely by reason of having failed to make such monthly\\npersonal allowance available prior to the time such payment is actually\\nreceived.\\n  9. In addition to any damages or civil penalties to which a person may\\nbe subject;\\n  (a) any person who intentionally withholds a resident's personal\\nallowance, or who demands, beneficially receives, or contracts for\\npayment of all or any part of a resident's personal allowances in\\nsatisfaction of the facility rate for supplies and services shall be\\nguilty of a class A misdemeanor;\\n  (b) any person who commingles, borrows from or pledges any personal\\nallowance funds required to be held in a separate account shall be\\nguilty of a class A misdemeanor.\\n",

In the case of a person receiving public assistance, supplemental\\nsecurity income benefits or additional state payments pursuant to this\\nchapter, the social services official of the social services district in\\nwhich such person resides shall, unless alternative payment or living\\narrangements can be made, make a payment to a gas corporation, electric\\ncorporation or municipality for services provided to such person for the\\nmost recent four months in which service was rendered prior to the\\napplication for a utility payment pursuant to this section, provided\\nthat no such payment shall be made for services rendered more than ten\\nmonths prior to the application for such a payment, and provided further\\nthat:\\n  (a) such person does not have any funds to pay for such service and\\nsuch payment is needed to prevent termination or to restore service and\\nsuch person has fully applied his public assistance grant, if any, to\\npurposes intended to be included in such grant, or\\n  (b) such person in receipt of public assistance has made a written\\nrequest of such official for an advance allowance for utility services\\nalready received pursuant to department regulations and has also made a\\nwritten request that his monthly assistance grant be reduced by a\\nportion of the amount of the advanced allowance, in such amounts as not\\nto cause undue hardship.

(a) It shall\\nbe unlawful for any person, firm or corporation knowingly by means of a\\nfalse statement or representation, or by deliberate concealment of any\\nmaterial fact, or other fraudulent scheme or device, on behalf of\\nhimself or others, to attempt to obtain or to obtain payment from public\\nfunds for services or supplies furnished or purportedly furnished\\npursuant to this chapter.\\n  (b) For purposes of this section, \"statement or representation\"\\nincludes, but is not limited to: a claim for payment made to the state,\\na political subdivision of the state, or an entity performing services\\nunder contract to the state or a political subdivision of the state; an\\nacknowledgment, certification, claim, ratification or report of data\\nwhich serves as the basis for a claim or a rate of payment, financial\\ninformation whether in a cost report or otherwise, health care services\\navailable or rendered, and the qualifications of a person that is or has\\nrendered health care services.\\n  (c) For purposes of this section, a person, firm or corporation has\\nattempted to obtain or has obtained public funds when any portion of the\\nfunds from which payment was attempted or obtained are public funds, or\\nany public funds are used to reimburse or make prospective payment to an\\nentity from which payment was attempted or obtained.\\n  2. For any violation of subdivision one, the local social services\\ndistrict or the state shall have a right to recover civil damages equal\\nto three times the amount by which any figure is falsely overstated or\\nin the case of non-monetary false statements or representations, three\\ntimes the amount of damages which the state, political subdivision of\\nthe state, or entity performing services under contract to the state or\\npolitical subdivision of the state sustain as a result of the violation\\nor five thousand dollars, whichever is greater. Notwithstanding part C\\nof chapter fifty-eight of the laws of two thousand five: (a) For civil\\ndamages collected by a local social services district, relating to the\\nmedical assistance program, pursuant to a judgment under this\\nsubdivision, such amounts shall be apportioned between the local social\\nservices district and the state. If the violation occurred: (i) prior to\\nJanuary first, two thousand six, the amount apportioned to the local\\nsocial services district shall be the local share percentage in effect\\nimmediately prior to such date as certified by the division of budget,\\nor (ii) after January first, two thousand six, the amount apportioned to\\nthe local social services district shall be based on a reimbursement\\nschedule, created by the office of Medicaid inspector general, in effect\\nat the time the violation occurred; provided that, if there is no\\nschedule in effect at the time the violation occurred, the schedule to\\nbe used shall be the first schedule adopted pursuant to this\\nsubdivision. Such schedule shall provide for reimbursement to a local\\nsocial services district in an amount between ten and fifteen percent of\\nthe gross amount collected. Such schedule shall be set on a county by\\ncounty basis and shall be periodically reviewed and updated as\\nnecessary; provided, however, that any such updated schedule shall not\\nbe less than ten percent nor greater than fifteen percent of the gross\\namount collected; and (b) For civil damages collected by the state\\nrelating to the medical assistance program pursuant to a judgment under\\nthis subdivision, the local social services district shall be entitled\\nto compensation up to fifteen percent of the gross amount collected for\\nsuch participation, including but not limited to identification,\\ninvestigation or development of a case, commensurate with its level of\\neffort or value added as determined by the Medicaid inspector general.\\n  3. If any provider or supplier of services in the program of medical\\nassistance is required to refund or repay all or part of any payment\\nreceived by said provider or supplier under the provisions of this\\nchapter and title XIX of the federal social security act, said refund or\\nrepayment shall bear interest from the date the payment was made to said\\nprovider or supplier to the date of said refund or repayment. Interest\\nshall be at the maximum legal rate in effect on the date the payment was\\nmade to said provider or supplier.\\n  4. (a) The department of health may require the payment of a monetary\\npenalty as restitution to the medical assistance program by any person\\nwho fails to comply with the standards of the medical assistance program\\nor of generally accepted medical practice in a substantial number of\\ncases or grossly and flagrantly violated such standards and receives, or\\ncauses to be received by another person, payment from the medical\\nassistance program when such person knew, or had reason to know, that:\\n  (i) the payment involved the providing or ordering of care, services\\nor supplies that were medically improper, unnecessary or in excess of\\nthe documented medical needs of the person to whom they were furnished;\\n  (ii) the care, services or supplies were not provided as claimed;\\n  (iii) the person who ordered or prescribed care, services or supplies\\nwhich was medically improper, unnecessary or in excess of the documented\\nmedical need of the person to whom they were furnished was suspended or\\nexcluded from the medical assistance program at the time the care,\\nservices or supplies were furnished; or\\n  (iv) the services or supplies for which payment was received were not,\\nin fact, provided.\\n  (b) For each claim, the department of health is authorized to recover\\nany overpayment, unauthorized payment, or otherwise inappropriate\\npayment and if twenty-five percent or more of those claims which were\\nthe subject of an audit by the department of health result in\\noverpayments, unauthorized payments or otherwise inappropriate payments\\nand for which the claims were submitted by a person for payment under\\nthe medical assistance program, the department may also impose a\\nmonetary penalty against any person, or persons, who received the\\noverpayment, unauthorized payment, or otherwise inappropriate payment\\nfor such claim. If less than twenty-five percent of identified claims\\nresult in overpayments, unauthorized payments or otherwise inappropriate\\npayments then the department of health may recover such monies or may\\nimpose a monetary penalty, but not both. In addition, the department of\\nhealth is also authorized to recover any overpayment, unauthorized\\npayment, or otherwise inappropriate payment and impose a monetary\\npenalty against any person, or persons, other than a recipient of an\\nitem or service under the medical assistance program, who caused the\\noverpayment, unauthorized payment, or otherwise inappropriate payment to\\nbe received by the other person or persons. All of the foregoing actions\\nmay be taken by the department of health for the same claim. In\\ndetermining the amount of any monetary penalty to be imposed, the\\ndepartment of health must take into consideration the following: (i) the\\nnumber and total value of the claims for payment from the medical\\nassistance program which were the underlying basis of the determination\\nto impose a monetary penalty; (ii) the effect, if any, on the quality of\\nmedical care provided to recipients of medical assistance as a result of\\nthe acts of the person; (iii) the degree of culpability of the person in\\ncommitting the proscribed actions and any mitigating circumstances; (iv)\\nany prior violations committed by the person relating to the medical\\nassistance program, Medicare or other social services programs which\\nresulted in either a criminal or administrative sanction, penalty, or\\nrecoupment; and (v) any other facts relating to the nature and\\nseriousness of the violations including any exculpatory facts. However,\\nin no event can the department of health recover overpayments,\\nunauthorized payments, or otherwise inappropriate payments from any\\nperson, or persons, for a single claim, in an amount that exceeds the\\namount paid for such claim. In no event shall the monetary penalty\\nimposed exceed ten thousand dollars for each item or service which was\\nthe subject of the determination herein, except that where a penalty\\nunder this section has been imposed on a person within the previous five\\nyears, such penalty shall not exceed thirty thousand dollars for each\\nitem or service which was the subject of the determination herein.\\n  (c) Amounts collected pursuant to this subdivision shall be\\napportioned between the local social services district and the state in\\naccordance with the regulations of the department of health.\\n  5. When in the course of conducting an investigation relating to the\\ninvestigation relating to the medical assistance program, a local social\\nservices district deduces that a provider may have committed criminal\\nfraud, it shall refer the case to the office of Medicaid inspector\\ngeneral along with appropriate supporting information. The office shall\\npromptly review the case and, if deemed appropriate, refer the case\\npursuant to subdivision seven of section thirty-two of the public health\\nlaw. If the deputy attorney general for Medicaid fraud control accepts a\\nreferral from the office of Medicaid inspector general that was\\nidentified, investigated or developed by a local social services\\ndistrict, and the state collects damages, the participating local social\\nservices district shall be entitled to compensation up to fifteen\\npercent of the gross amount collected for such participation\\ncommensurate with its level of effort or value added as determined by\\nthe deputy attorney general for Medicaid fraud control. If the office of\\nMedicaid inspector general determines that it is not appropriate for\\nreferral in accordance with subdivision seven of section thirty-two of\\nthe public health law the office of Medicaid inspector general shall\\nfurther investigate the case, with notice to the participating local\\nsocial services district, or return the case to the participating social\\nservices district, which may resume its investigation of the provider.\\n",

Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the state shall not be\\nresponsible for reimbursing a social services district and a district\\nshall not seek state reimbursement for any portion of any state\\ndisallowance or sanction taken against the social services district, or\\nany federal disallowance attributable to final federal agency decisions\\nor to settlements made, on or after July first, nineteen hundred\\nninety-five, when such disallowance or sanction results from the failure\\nof the social services district to comply with federal or state\\nrequirements, including, but not limited to, failure to document\\neligibility for the federal or state funds in the case record; provided,\\nhowever, if the office of children and family services determines that\\nany federal disallowance for services provided between January first,\\nnineteen hundred ninety-nine and May thirty-first, nineteen hundred\\nninety-nine results solely from the late enactment of the state\\nlegislation implementing the federal adoption and safe families act, the\\nstate shall be solely responsible for the full amount of the\\ndisallowance or sanction. This provision shall be deemed to apply both\\nprospectively and retroactively regardless of whether the disallowance\\nor sanction is for services provided or claims made prior to or after\\nApril first, two thousand two.\\n  10.

For social services districts in counties with less than fifteen\\nthousand children under the age of eighteen, the office may waive the\\nfiscal penalties and the need for a corrective action plan if the\\nfailure to substantially comply with the outcome standards was based on\\nextraordinary circumstances. The office may provide fiscal incentives to\\nsocial services districts with high performances on the federal child\\nwelfare outcome standards. A social services district may pass on to its\\ncontract agencies some portion of the fiscal penalties or fiscal\\nincentives that may be attributable to such agencies.\\n  (ii) The office shall provide an annual report to the governor and the\\nlegislature detailing: each county's performance on the outcome\\nstandards, the amount of fiscal penalties imposed against each county,\\nand the amount of fiscal penalties collected from each county.

(a) Upon application and\\nrecertification for public assistance benefits, or whenever a district\\nhas reason to believe that a physical or mental impairment may prevent\\nthe individual from fully engaging in work activities, the social\\nservices district shall inquire whether the individual has any medical\\ncondition which would limit the individual's ability to participate in\\nwork activities pursuant to this title.\\n  (b) An individual who is eligible to receive comprehensive health\\nservices through a special needs plan defined in paragraph (m) or (n) of\\nsubdivision one of section three hundred sixty-four-j of this chapter,\\nregardless of whether such a plan is operating in the individual's\\nsocial services district of residence, shall be considered disabled and\\nunable to engage in work activities or shall be considered work-limited.\\n  2. (a) Under the circumstances set forth in subdivision one of this\\nsection, notice shall be provided to the individual of the opportunity\\nto provide, within ten calendar days, any relevant medical\\ndocumentation, including but not limited to drug prescriptions and\\nreports of the individual's treating health care practitioner, if any;\\nsuch documentation must contain a specific diagnosis as evidenced by\\nmedically appropriate tests or evaluations and must particularize any\\nwork related limitations as a result of any such diagnosis.\\n  (b) If, prior to submitting his or her medical documentation, the\\nindividual is referred to a health care practitioner certified by the\\noffice of disability determinations of the office of temporary and\\ndisability assistance or, if applicable, to the contracted agency or\\ninstitution by or with which such health care practitioner is employed\\nor affiliated for an examination pursuant to subdivision four of this\\nsection, such individual shall make best efforts to bring such\\ndocumentation to the examination, and in no case shall provide such\\nrecords to the examining health care practitioner certified by the\\noffice of disability determinations or, if applicable, to the contracted\\nagency or institution by or with which such health care practitioner is\\nemployed or affiliated later than four business days after such\\nexamination; provided that the individual may demonstrate good cause as\\ndefined in regulations, for failure to provide such records within the\\nspecific time periods.\\n  3.

If such applicant timely requests a fair\\nhearing, no assignment to work activities pursuant to this title may be\\nmade pending such hearing and determination unless the applicant or\\nrecipient agrees to a limited work assignment not inconsistent with the\\nmedical condition alleged by such person.

Such inquiry shall be performed utilizing a universal screening\\nform to be developed by the department after consultation with the\\noffice for the prevention of domestic violence and statewide domestic\\nviolence advocacy groups. An individual may request such screening at\\nany time, and any individual who at any time self identifies as a victim\\nof domestic violence shall be afforded the opportunity for such\\nscreening.\\n  3.

The petition shall request that,\\npending any hearing which may be required by the family court judge, a\\ntemporary order be made transferring the care and custody of the child\\nto the social services official in accordance with the provisions of\\nsubdivision three of this section. In the case of a child whose care and\\ncustody have been transferred to a social services official by means of\\nan instrument executed pursuant to section three hundred eighty-four-a\\nof this chapter, the petition shall also allege and there shall be shown\\nby affidavit or other proof satisfactory to the court that all the\\nrequirements of such section have been satisfied, including the results\\nof the investigation to locate relatives of the child, including any\\nnon-respondent parent and all of the child's grandparents. Such results\\nshall include whether any relative who has been located expressed an\\ninterest in becoming a foster parent for the child or in seeking custody\\nor care of the child.\\n  (b) The social services official who initiated the proceeding shall\\nfile supplemental information with the clerk of the court not later than\\nten days prior to the date on which the proceeding is first heard by the\\ncourt. Such information shall include relevant portions, as determined\\nby the department, of the assessment of the child and his family\\ncircumstances performed and maintained, and the family's service plan if\\navailable, pursuant to sections four hundred nine-e and four hundred\\nnine-f of this chapter. Copies of such supplemental information need not\\nbe served upon those persons entitled to notice of the proceeding and a\\ncopy of the petition pursuant to subdivision four of this section.\\n  (2-a) Continuing jurisdiction. (a) The court shall possess continuing\\njurisdiction over the parties until the child is discharged from\\nplacement and all orders regarding supervision, protection or services\\nhave expired.\\n  (b) The court, upon approving an instrument under this section, shall\\nschedule a permanency hearing pursuant to article ten-A of the family\\ncourt act for a date certain not more than eight months after the\\nplacement of the child into foster care. Such date certain shall be\\nincluded in the order approving the instrument.\\n  (3) Disposition of petition. (a) If the court is satisfied that the\\nparent, parents or guardian executed such instrument knowingly and\\nvoluntarily and because he or she would be unable to make adequate\\nprovision for the care, maintenance and supervision of such child in his\\nor her home, and that the requirements of section three hundred\\neighty-four-a of this chapter, if applicable, have been satisfied and\\nthat where appropriate, reasonable efforts were made prior to the\\nplacement of the child into foster care to prevent or eliminate the need\\nfor removal of the child from his or her home and that prior to the\\ninitiation of the court proceeding required to be held by subdivision\\none of this section, reasonable efforts were made to make it possible\\nfor the child to return safely to his or her home, the court may find\\nand determine that the best interests and welfare of the child would be\\npromoted by removal of the child from such home, and that it would be\\ncontrary to the welfare of such child for the child to continue in such\\nhome, and the court shall thereupon grant the petition and approve such\\ninstrument and the transfer of the custody and guardianship or care and\\ncustody of such child to such social services official in accordance\\ntherewith. If the court determines that, where appropriate, reasonable\\nefforts were made prior to the placement of the child into foster care\\nto prevent or eliminate the need for removal of the child from his or\\nher home, that prior to the initiation of the court proceeding\\nreasonable efforts were made to make it possible for the child to return\\nsafely to his or her home, or that it would be contrary to the best\\ninterests of the child to continue in the home, or that reasonable\\nefforts to prevent or eliminate the need for removal of the child from\\nthe home were not made but that the lack of such efforts was appropriate\\nunder the circumstances, the court order shall include such findings.\\nApproval of such instrument in a proceeding pursuant to this section\\nshall not constitute a remand or commitment pursuant to this chapter and\\nshall not preclude challenge in any other proceeding to the validity of\\nthe instrument. If the permanency plan for the child is adoption,\\nguardianship, permanent placement with a fit and willing relative or\\nanother planned permanent living arrangement other than reunification\\nwith the parent or parents of the child, the court must consider and\\ndetermine in its order whether reasonable efforts are being made to make\\nand finalize such alternate permanent placement.\\n  (b) For the purpose of this section, reasonable efforts to prevent or\\neliminate the need for removing the child from the home of the child or\\nto make it possible for the child to return safely to the home of the\\nchild shall not be required where the court determines that:\\n  (1) the parent of such child has subjected the child to aggravated\\ncircumstances, as defined in subdivision twelve of this section;\\n  (2) the parent of such child has been convicted of (i) murder in the\\nfirst degree as defined in section 125.27 or murder in the second degree\\nas defined in section 125.25 of the penal law and the victim was another\\nchild of the parent; or (ii) manslaughter in the first degree as defined\\nin section 125.20 or manslaughter in the second degree as defined in\\nsection 125.15 of the penal law and the victim was another child of the\\nparent, provided, however, that the parent must have acted voluntarily\\nin committing such crime;\\n  (3) the parent of such child has been convicted of an attempt to\\ncommit any of the foregoing crimes, and the victim or intended victim\\nwas the child or another child of the parent; or has been convicted of\\ncriminal solicitation as defined in article one hundred, conspiracy as\\ndefined in article one hundred five or criminal facilitation as defined\\nin article one hundred fifteen of the penal law for conspiring,\\nsoliciting or facilitating any of the foregoing crimes, and the victim\\nor intended victim was the child or another child of the parent;\\n  (4) the parent of such child has been convicted of assault in the\\nsecond degree as defined in section 120.05, assault in the first degree\\nas defined in section 120.10 or aggravated assault upon a person less\\nthan eleven years old as defined in section 120.12 of the penal law, and\\nthe commission of one of the foregoing crimes resulted in serious\\nphysical injury to the child or another child of the parent;\\n  (5) the parent of such child has been convicted in any other\\njurisdiction of an offense which includes all of the essential elements\\nof any crime specified in subparagraph two, three or four of this\\nparagraph, and the victim of such offense was the child or another child\\nof the parent; or\\n  (6) the parental rights of the parent to a sibling of such child have\\nbeen involuntarily terminated;\\nunless the court determines that providing reasonable efforts would be\\nin the best interests of the child, not contrary to the health and\\nsafety of the child, and would likely result in the reunification of the\\nparent and the child in the foreseeable future. The court shall state\\nsuch findings in its order.\\n  If the court determines that reasonable efforts are not required\\nbecause of one of the grounds set forth above, a permanency hearing\\nshall be held within thirty days of the finding of the court that such\\nefforts are not required. Such hearing shall be conducted pursuant to\\nsection one thousand eighty-nine of the family court act. The local\\nsocial services official shall thereafter make reasonable efforts to\\nplace the child in a timely manner and to complete whatever steps are\\nnecessary to finalize the permanent placement of the child as set forth\\nin the permanency plan approved by the court. If reasonable efforts are\\ndetermined by the court not to be required because of one of the grounds\\nset forth in this paragraph, the local social services official may file\\na petition for termination of parental rights of the parent in\\naccordance with section three hundred eighty-four-b of this chapter.\\n  (c) For the purpose of this section, in determining reasonable efforts\\nto be made with respect to a child, and in making such reasonable\\nefforts, the child's health and safety shall be the paramount concern.\\n  (d) For the purpose of this section, a sibling shall include a\\nhalf-sibling.\\n  (e) The order granting the petition of a social services official and\\napproving an instrument executed pursuant to section three hundred\\neighty-four-a of this chapter may include conditions, where appropriate\\nand specified by the judge, requiring the implementation of a specific\\nplan of action by the social services official to exercise diligent\\nefforts toward the discharge of the child from care, either to his own\\nfamily or to an adoptive home; provided, however, that such plan shall\\nnot include the provision of any service or assistance to the child and\\nhis or her family which is not authorized or required to be made\\navailable pursuant to the comprehensive annual services program plan\\nthen in effect. An order of placement shall include, at the least:\\n  (i) a description of the visitation plan;\\n  (ii) a direction that the respondent or respondents shall be notified\\nof the planning conference or conferences to be held pursuant to\\nsubdivision three of section four hundred nine-e of this chapter, of\\ntheir right to attend the conference, and of their right to have counsel\\nor other representative or companion with them;\\n  A copy of the court's order and the service plan shall be given to the\\nrespondent. The order shall also contain a notice that if the child\\nremains in foster care for more than fifteen of the most recent\\ntwenty-two months, the agency may be required by law to file a petition\\nto terminate parental rights.\\n  Nothing in such order shall preclude either party to the instrument\\nfrom exercising its rights under this section or under any other\\nprovision of law relating to the return of the care and custody of the\\nchild by the social services official to the parent, parents or\\nguardian. Violation of such on order shall be subject to punishment\\npursuant to section seven hundred fifty-three of the judiciary law.\\n  (f) For a child who has attained the age of fourteen, if the court\\ngrants the petition and approves an instrument executed pursuant to\\nsection three hundred eighty-four or three hundred eighty-four-a of this\\nchapter and the transfer of custody and guardianship or care and custody\\nof the child to a local social services official the court shall\\ndetermine in its order the services and assistance needed to assist the\\nchild in learning independent living skills.\\n  * (g) In any case in which an order has been issued pursuant to this\\nsection approving a foster care placement instrument, the social\\nservices official or authorized agency charged with custody or care of\\nthe child shall report any anticipated change in placement to the\\nattorneys for the parties and the attorney for the child not later than\\nten days prior to such change in any case in which the child is moved\\nfrom the foster home or program into which he or she has been placed or\\nin which the foster parents move out of state with the child; provided,\\nhowever, that where an immediate change of placement on an emergency\\nbasis is required, the report shall be transmitted no later than the\\nnext business day after such change in placement has been made. The\\nsocial services official or authorized agency shall also submit a report\\nto the attorneys for the parties and the attorney for the child or\\ninclude in the placement change report any indicated report of child\\nabuse or maltreatment concerning the child or (if a person or persons\\ncaring for the child is or are the subject of the report) another child\\nin the same home within five days of the indication of the report. The\\nofficial or agency may protect the confidentiality of identifying or\\naddress information regarding the foster or prospective adoptive\\nparents. Reports regarding indicated reports of child abuse or\\nmaltreatment provided pursuant to this subdivision shall include a\\nstatement advising recipients that the information in such report of\\nchild abuse or maltreatment shall be kept confidential, shall be used\\nonly in connection with a proceeding under this section or related\\nproceedings under the family court act and may not be redisclosed except\\nas necessary for such proceeding or proceedings and as authorized by\\nlaw. Reports under this paragraph may be transmitted by any appropriate\\nmeans including, but not limited to, by electronic means or placement on\\nthe record during proceedings in family court.\\n  * NB Effective April 20, 2020\\n  (4) Notice. (a) Upon the filing of a petition pursuant to this\\nsection, the family court judge shall direct that service of a notice of\\nthe proceeding and a copy of the petition shall be made upon such\\npersons and in such manner as the judge may direct. If the instrument\\nexecuted by the parent, parents or guardian of a child consents to the\\njurisdiction of the family court over such proceeding, and waives\\nservice of the petition and notice of proceeding, then the family court\\njudge may, in his discretion, dispense with service upon the consenting\\nparent, parents or guardian, provided, however, that a waiver of service\\nof process and notice of the proceeding by a parent or guardian who has\\ntransferred the care and custody of a child to an authorized agency,\\npursuant to section three hundred eighty-four-a of this chapter, shall\\nbe null and void and shall not be given effect by the court. Notice to\\nany parent, parents or guardian who has not executed the instrument\\nshall be required.\\n  (b) In the event the family court judge determines that service by\\npublication is necessary and orders service by publication, service\\nshall be made in accordance with the provisions of rule three hundred\\nsixteen of the civil practice law and rules, provided, however, that a\\nsingle publication of the summons or other process with a notice as\\nspecified herein in only one newspaper designated in the order shall be\\nsufficient. In no event shall the whole petition be published. The\\npetition shall be delivered to the person summoned at the first court\\nappearance pursuant to section one hundred fifty-four-a of the family\\ncourt act. The notice to be published with the summons or other process\\nshall state the date, time, place and purpose of the proceeding.\\n  (i) If the petition is initiated to transfer custody and guardianship\\nof a child by an instrument executed pursuant to the provisions of\\nsection three hundred eighty-four of this chapter, the notice to be\\npublished shall also state that failure to appear may result, without\\nfurther notice, in the transfer of custody and guardianship of the child\\nto a social services official in this proceeding.\\n  (ii) If the petition is initiated to transfer care and custody of a\\nchild by an instrument executed pursuant to the provisions of section\\nthree hundred eighty-four-a of this chapter, the notice to be published\\nshall also state that failure to appear may result, without further\\nnotice, in the transfer of care and custody of the child to a social\\nservices official in this proceeding.\\n  (5) Hearing and waiver. The instrument may include a consent by the\\nparent, parents or guardian to waiver of any hearing and that a\\ndetermination may be made by the family court judge based solely upon\\nthe petition, and other papers and affidavits, if any, submitted to the\\nfamily court judge, provided, however, that a waiver of hearing by a\\nparent or guardian who has transferred the care and custody of a child\\nto an authorized agency, pursuant to section three hundred eighty-four-a\\nof this chapter, shall be effective only if such waiver was executed in\\nan instrument separate from that transferring the child's care and\\ncustody. In any case where an effective waiver has been executed, the\\nfamily court judge may dispense with a hearing, approve the instrument\\nand the transfer of the custody and guardianship or care and custody of\\nthe child to the social services official and make the requisite\\nfindings and determinations provided for in subdivision three of this\\nsection, if it appears to the satisfaction of the family court judge\\nthat the allegations in the petition are established sufficiently to\\nwarrant the family court judge to grant such petition, to make such\\nfindings and determination, and to issue such order.\\n  In any case where a hearing is required, the family court judge, if\\nthe holding of an immediate hearing on notice is impractical, may\\nforthwith, upon the basis of the instrument and the allegations of the\\npetition, make a temporary finding that the parent, parents, or guardian\\nof the child are unable to make adequate provision for the care,\\nmaintenance and supervision of such child in the child's own home and\\nthat the best interest and welfare of the child will be promoted by the\\nremoval of such child from such home and thereupon, the family court\\njudge shall make a temporary order transferring the care and custody of\\nsuch child to the social services official, and shall set the matter\\ndown for hearing on the first feasible date.\\n  (6) Representation. In any case where a hearing is directed by the\\nfamily court judge, he or she shall, pursuant to section two hundred\\nforty-nine of the family court act, appoint an attorney to represent the\\nchild, who shall be admitted to practice law in the state of New York.\\n  (7) Return of child. If an instrument provides for the return of the\\ncare and custody of a child by the local social services official to the\\nparent, parents or guardian upon any terms and conditions or at any\\ntime, the local social services official shall comply with such terms of\\nsuch instrument without further court order. Every order approving an\\ninstrument providing for the transfer of the care and custody of a child\\nto a local social services official shall be served upon the parent,\\nparents or guardian who executed such instrument in such manner as the\\nfamily court judge may provide in such order, together with a notice of\\nthe terms and conditions under which the care and custody of such child\\nmay be returned to the parent, parents or guardian. If an instrument\\nprovides for the return of the care and custody of a child by the local\\nsocial services official to the parent, parents or guardian without\\nfixing a definite date for such return, or if the local social services\\nofficial shall fail to return a child to the care and custody of the\\nchild's parent, parents or guardian in accordance with the terms of the\\ninstrument, the parent, parents or guardian may seek such care and\\ncustody by motion for return of such child and order to show cause in\\nsuch proceeding or by writ of habeas corpus in the supreme court.\\nNothing in this subdivision shall limit the requirement for a permanency\\nhearing pursuant to article ten-A of the family court act.\\n  (8) Appealable orders. Any order of a family court denying any\\npetition of a local social services official filed pursuant to this\\nsection, or any order of a family court granting or denying any motion\\nfiled by a parent, parents or guardian for return of a child pursuant to\\nthis section, shall be deemed an order of disposition appealable\\npursuant to article eleven of the family court act.\\n  (9) Duty of social services official. In the event that a family court\\njudge denies a petition of a social services official for approval of an\\ninstrument, upon a finding that the welfare of the child would not be\\npromoted by foster care, such social services official shall not accept\\nor retain the care and custody as a public charge or custody and\\nguardianship of such child, provided, however, that the denial by a\\nfamily court judge of a petition of a social services official filed\\npursuant to this section shall not limit or affect the duty of such\\nsocial services official to take such other action or offer such\\nservices as are authorized by law to promote the welfare and best\\ninterests of the child.\\n  (10) Visitation rights; non-custodial parents and grandparents. (a)\\nWhere a social services official incorporates in an instrument\\nvisitation rights set forth in an order, judgment or agreement as\\ndescribed in paragraph (d) of subdivision two of section three hundred\\neighty-four-a of this chapter, such official shall make inquiry of the\\nstate central register of child abuse and maltreatment to determine\\nwhether or not the person having such visitation rights is a subject or\\nanother person named in an indicated report of child abuse or\\nmaltreatment, as such terms are defined in section four hundred twelve\\nof this chapter, and shall further ascertain, to the extent practicable,\\nwhether or not such person is a respondent in a proceeding under article\\nten of the family court act whereby the respondent has been alleged or\\nadjudicated to have abused or neglected such child.\\n  (b) Where a social services official or the attorney for the child\\nopposes incorporation of an order, judgment or agreement conferring\\nvisitation rights as provided for in paragraph (e) of subdivision two of\\nsection three hundred eighty-four-a of this chapter, the social services\\nofficial or attorney for the child shall apply for an order determining\\nthat the provisions of such order, judgment or agreement should not be\\nincorporated into the instrument executed pursuant to such section. Such\\norder shall be granted upon a finding, based on competent, relevant and\\nmaterial evidence, that the child's life or health would be endangered\\nby incorporation and enforcement of visitation rights as described in\\nsuch order, judgment or agreement. Otherwise, the court shall deny such\\napplication.\\n  (c) Where visitation rights pursuant to an order, judgment or\\nagreement are incorporated in an instrument, the parties may agree to an\\nalternative schedule of visitation equivalent to and consistent with the\\noriginal or modified visitation order, judgment, or agreement where such\\nalternative schedule reflects changed circumstances of the parties and\\nis consistent with the best interests of the child. In the absence of\\nsuch an agreement between the parties, the court may, in its discretion,\\nupon application of any party or the child's attorney, order an\\nalternative schedule of visitation, as described herein, where it\\ndetermines that such schedule is necessary to facilitate visitation and\\nto protect the best interests of the child.\\n  (d) The order providing an alternative schedule of visitation shall\\nremain in effect for the length of the placement of the child as\\nprovided for in such instrument unless such order is subsequently\\nmodified by the court for good cause shown. Whenever the court makes an\\norder denying or modifying visitation rights pursuant to this\\nsubdivision, the instrument described in section three hundred\\neighty-four-a of this chapter shall be deemed amended accordingly.\\n  (11) Siblings, placement and visitation. (a) In reviewing any petition\\nbrought under this section, the court shall inquire if the social\\nservices official has arranged for the placement of the child who is the\\nsubject of the petition with any minor siblings or half-siblings who are\\nplaced in care or, if such children have not been placed together,\\nwhether such official has arranged for regular visitation and other\\nforms of regular communication between such child and such siblings.\\n  (b) If the court determines that the subject child has not been placed\\nwith his or her minor siblings or half-siblings who are in care, or that\\nregular visitation and other forms of regular communication between the\\nsubject child and his or her minor siblings or half-siblings has not\\nbeen provided or arranged for, the court may direct such official to\\nprovide or arrange for such placement or regular visitation and\\ncommunication where the court finds that such placement or visitation\\nand communication is in the child's and his or her siblings' or\\nhalf-siblings' best interests. Placement or regular visitation and\\ncommunication with siblings or half-siblings shall be presumptively in\\nthe child's and his or her siblings' or half-siblings' best interests\\nunless such placement or visitation and communication would be contrary\\nto the child's or his or her siblings' or half-siblings' health, safety\\nor welfare, or the lack of geographic proximity precludes or prevents\\nvisitation.\\n  (c) If a child placed in foster care pursuant to this section is not\\nplaced together or afforded regular communication with his or her\\nsiblings, the child, through his or her attorney or through a parent on\\nhis or her behalf, may move for an order regarding placement or\\ncommunication. The motion shall be served upon: (i) the parent or\\nparents in the proceeding under this section; (ii) the local social\\nservices official having the care of the child; (iii) other persons\\nhaving care, custody and control of the child, if any; (iv) the parents\\nor other persons having care, custody and control of the siblings to be\\nvisited or with whom contact is sought; (v) such sibling himself or\\nherself if ten years of age or older; and (vi) such sibling's attorney,\\nif any. Upon receipt of a motion filed under this paragraph the court\\nshall determine, after giving notice and an opportunity to be heard to\\nthe persons served, whether visitation and contact would be in the best\\ninterests of the child and his or her siblings. The court may order that\\nthe child be placed together with or have regular communication with his\\nor her siblings if the court determines it to be in the best interests\\nof the child and his or her siblings.\\n  (d) For purposes of this section, \"siblings\" shall include\\nhalf-siblings and those who would be deemed siblings or half-siblings\\nbut for the surrender, termination of parental rights or death of a\\nparent.\\n  (12) For the purposes of this section, aggravated circumstances means\\nwhere a child has been either severely or repeatedly abused, as defined\\nin subdivision eight of section three hundred eighty-four-b of this\\nchapter; or where a child has subsequently been found to be an abused\\nchild, as defined in paragraph (i) or (iii) of subdivision (e) of\\nsection one thousand twelve of the family court act, within five years\\nafter return home following placement in foster care as a result of\\nbeing found to be a neglected child, as defined in subdivision (f) of\\nsection one thousand twelve of the family court act, provided that the\\nrespondent or respondents in each of the foregoing proceedings was the\\nsame; or where the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the\\nparent of a child in foster care has refused and has failed completely,\\nover a period of at least six months from the date of removal, to engage\\nin services necessary to eliminate the risk of abuse or neglect if\\nreturned to the parent, and has failed to secure services on his or her\\nown or otherwise adequately prepare for the return home and, after being\\ninformed by the court that such an admission could eliminate the\\nrequirement that the local department of social services provide\\nreunification services to the parent, the parent has stated in court\\nunder oath that he or she intends to continue to refuse such necessary\\nservices and is unwilling to secure such services independently or\\notherwise prepare for the child's return home; provided, however, that\\nif the court finds that adequate justification exists for the failure to\\nengage in or secure such services, including but not limited to a lack\\nof child care, a lack of transportation, and an inability to attend\\nservices that conflict with the parent's work schedule, such failure\\nshall not constitute an aggravated circumstance; or where a court has\\ndetermined a child five days old or younger was abandoned by a parent\\nwith an intent to wholly abandon such child and with the intent that the\\nchild be safe from physical injury and cared for in an appropriate\\nmanner.\\n",

                  "text" : "  § 363-d. Provider compliance program. 1. The legislature finds that\\nmedical assistance providers may be able to detect and correct payment\\nand billing mistakes and fraud if required to develop and implement\\ncompliance programs. It is the purpose of such programs to organize\\nprovider resources to resolve payment discrepancies and detect\\ninaccurate billings, among other things, as quickly and efficiently as\\npossible, and to impose systemic checks and balances to prevent future\\nrecurrences. The legislature accordingly declares that it is in the\\npublic interest that providers within the medical assistance program\\nimplement compliance programs. The legislature also recognizes the wide\\nvariety of provider types in the medical assistance program and the need\\nfor compliance programs that reflect a provider's size, complexity,\\nresources, and culture. For a compliance program to be effective, it\\nmust be designed to be compatible with the provider's characteristics.\\nAt the same time, however, the legislature determines that there are key\\ncomponents that must be included in every compliance program and such\\ncomponents should be required if a provider is to be a medical\\nassistance program participant. Accordingly, the provisions of this\\nsection require providers to adopt effective compliance program\\nelements, and make each provider responsible for implementing such a\\nprogram appropriate to its characteristics.\\n  2. Every provider of medical assistance program items and services\\nthat is subject to subdivision four of this section shall adopt and\\nimplement a compliance program. The office of Medicaid inspector general\\nshall create and make available on its website guidelines, which may\\ninclude a model compliance program, that reflect the requirements of\\nthis section.  Such program shall at a minimum be applicable to billings\\nto and payments from the medical assistance program but need not be\\nconfined to such matters. The compliance program required pursuant to\\nthis section may be a component of more comprehensive compliance\\nactivities by the medical assistance provider so long as the\\nrequirements of this section are met. A compliance program shall include\\nthe following elements:\\n  (a) written policies and procedures that describe compliance\\nexpectations as embodied in a code of conduct or code of ethics,\\nimplement the operation of the compliance program, provide guidance to\\nemployees and others on dealing with potential compliance issues,\\nidentify how to communicate compliance issues to appropriate compliance\\npersonnel and describe how potential compliance problems are\\ninvestigated and resolved;\\n  (b) designate an employee vested with responsibility for the\\nday-to-day operation of the compliance program; such employee's duties\\nmay solely relate to compliance or may be combined with other duties so\\nlong as compliance responsibilities are satisfactorily carried out; such\\nemployee shall report directly to the entity's chief executive or other\\nsenior administrator and shall periodically report directly to the\\ngoverning body on the activities of the compliance program;\\n  (c) training and education of all affected employees and persons\\nassociated with the provider, including executives and governing body\\nmembers, on compliance issues, expectations and the compliance program\\noperation; such training shall occur periodically and shall be made a\\npart of the orientation for a new employee, appointee or associate,\\nexecutive and governing body member;\\n  (d) communication lines to the responsible compliance position, as\\ndescribed in paragraph (b) of this subdivision, that are accessible to\\nall employees, persons associated with the provider, executives and\\ngoverning body members, to allow compliance issues to be reported; such\\ncommunication lines shall include a method for anonymous and\\nconfidential good faith reporting of potential compliance issues as they\\nare identified;\\n  (e) disciplinary policies to encourage good faith participation in the\\ncompliance program by all affected individuals, including policies that\\narticulate expectations for reporting compliance issues and assist in\\ntheir resolution and outline sanctions for: (1) failing to report\\nsuspected problems; (2) participating in non-compliant behavior; or (3)\\nencouraging, directing, facilitating or permitting non-compliant\\nbehavior; such disciplinary policies shall be fairly and firmly\\nenforced;\\n  (f) a system for routine identification of compliance risk areas\\nspecific to the provider type, for self-evaluation of such risk areas,\\nincluding internal audits and as appropriate external audits, and for\\nevaluation of potential or actual non-compliance as a result of such\\nself-evaluations and audits;\\n  (g) a system for responding to compliance issues as they are raised;\\nfor investigating potential compliance problems; responding to\\ncompliance problems as identified in the course of self-evaluations and\\naudits; correcting such problems promptly and thoroughly and\\nimplementing procedures, policies and systems as necessary to reduce the\\npotential for recurrence; identifying and reporting compliance issues to\\nthe department or the office of Medicaid inspector general; and\\nrefunding overpayments;\\n  (h) a policy of non-intimidation and non-retaliation for good faith\\nparticipation in the compliance program, including but not limited to\\nreporting potential issues, investigating issues, self-evaluations,\\naudits and remedial actions, and reporting to appropriate officials as\\nprovided in sections seven hundred forty and seven hundred forty-one of\\nthe labor law.\\n  3. Upon enrollment in the medical assistance program, a provider shall\\ncertify to the department that the provider satisfactorily meets the\\nrequirements of this section. Additionally, the commissioner of health\\nand Medicaid inspector general shall have the authority to determine at\\nany time if a provider has a compliance program that satisfactorily\\nmeets the requirements of this section.\\n  (a) A compliance program that is accepted by the federal department of\\nhealth and human services office of inspector general and remains in\\ncompliance with the standards promulgated by such office shall be deemed\\nin compliance with the provisions of this section, so long as such plans\\nadequately address medical assistance program risk areas and compliance\\nissues.\\n  (b) A compliance program that meets Federal requirements for managed\\ncare provider compliance programs, as specified in the contract or\\ncontracts between the department and the Medicaid managed care provider\\nshall be deemed in compliance with the provisions in this section, so\\nlong as such programs adequately address medical assistance program risk\\nareas and compliance issues. For purposes of this section, a managed\\ncare provider is as defined in paragraph (c) of subdivision one of\\nsection three hundred sixty-four-j of this chapter, and includes managed\\nlong term care plans.\\n  (c) In the event that the commissioner of health or the Medicaid\\ninspector general finds that the provider does not have a satisfactory\\nprogram within ninety days after the effective date of the regulations\\nissued pursuant to subdivision four of this section, the provider may be\\nsubject to any sanctions or penalties permitted by federal or state laws\\nand regulations, including revocation of the provider's agreement to\\nparticipate in the medical assistance program.\\n  4. The Medicaid inspector general, in consultation with the department\\nof health, shall promulgate regulations establishing those providers\\nthat shall be subject to the provisions of this section including, but\\nnot limited to, those subject to the provisions of articles twenty-eight\\nand thirty-six of the public health law, articles sixteen and thirty-one\\nof the mental hygiene law, and other providers of care, services and\\nsupplies under the medical assistance program for which the medical\\nassistance program is a substantial portion of their business\\noperations.\\n",

An\\nindividual, upon application for medical assistance, shall be presumed\\neligible for such assistance for a period of sixty days from the date of\\ntransfer from a general hospital, as defined in section twenty-eight\\nhundred one of the public health law to a certified home health agency\\nor long term home health care program, as defined in section thirty-six\\nhundred two of the public health law, or to a hospice as defined in\\nsection four thousand two of the public health law, or to a residential\\nhealth care facility as defined in section twenty-eight hundred one of\\nthe public health law, if the local department of social services\\ndetermines that the applicant meets each of the following criteria: (a)\\nthe applicant is receiving acute care in such hospital; (b) a physician\\ncertifies that such applicant no longer requires acute hospital care,\\nbut still requires medical care which can be provided by a certified\\nhome health agency, long term home health care program, hospice or\\nresidential health care facility; (c) the applicant or his\\nrepresentative states that the applicant does not have insurance\\ncoverage for the required medical care and that such care cannot be\\nafforded; (d) it reasonably appears that the applicant is otherwise\\neligible to receive medical assistance; (e) it reasonably appears that\\nthe amount expended by the state and the local social services district\\nfor medical assistance in a certified home health agency, long term home\\nhealth care program, hospice or residential health care facility, during\\nthe period of presumed eligibility, would be less than the amount the\\nstate and the local social services district would expend for continued\\nacute hospital care for such person; and (f) such other determinative\\ncriteria as the commissioner shall provide by rule or regulation. If a\\nperson has been determined to be presumptively eligible for medical\\nassistance, pursuant to this subdivision, and is subsequently determined\\nto be ineligible for such assistance, the commissioner, on behalf of the\\nstate and the local social services district shall have the authority to\\nrecoup from the individual the sums expended for such assistance during\\nthe period of presumed eligibility.\\n  2.

Such federal and\\nlocal financial participation shall be the same as that which would have\\noccurred if a final determination of eligibility for medical assistance\\nhad been made prior to the provision of the services provided during the\\nperiod of presumptive eligibility. In instances where an individual who\\nis presumed eligible for medical assistance is subsequently determined\\nto be ineligible, the cost for services provided to such individual\\nshall be reimbursed in accordance with the provisions of section three\\nhundred sixty-eight-a of this article.

The\\ndepartment shall design and implement a statewide medical assistance\\ninformation and payments system for the purpose of providing individual\\nand aggregate data to social services districts to assist them in making\\nbasic management decisions, to the department and other state agencies\\nto assist in the administration of the medical assistance program, and\\nto the governor and the legislature as may be necessary to assist in\\nmaking major administrative and policy decisions affecting such program.\\nSuch system shall be designed so as to be capable of the following:\\n  a. receiving and processing information relating to the eligibility of\\neach person applying for medical assistance and of issuing a medical\\nassistance identification card to persons determined by a social\\nservices official to be eligible for such assistance;\\n  b. receiving and processing information relating to each qualified\\nprovider of medical assistance furnishing care, services or supplies for\\nwhich claims for payment are made pursuant to this title;\\n  c. receiving and processing, in a form and manner prescribed by the\\ndepartment, all claims for medical care, services and supplies, and\\nmaking payments for valid claims to providers of medical care, services\\nand supplies on behalf of social services districts;\\n  d. maintaining information necessary to allow the department,\\nconsistent with the powers and duties of the department of health, to\\nreview the appropriateness, scope and duration of medical care, services\\nand supplies provided to any eligible person pursuant to this chapter;\\nand\\n  e. initiating implementation of such a system for the district\\ncomprising the city of New York, in a manner compatible with expansion\\nof such system to districts other than the district comprising the city\\nof New York.\\n  2. Consistent with the capabilities of the system established pursuant\\nto subdivision one of this section, the department shall assume payment\\nresponsibilities on behalf of social services districts by promulgation\\nof regulations approved by the director of the budget. Such regulations\\nshall specify the providers of medical assistance and the medical care,\\nservices and/or supplies for the district or districts for which the\\ndepartment will assume payment responsibilities and the date on which\\nsuch responsibilities shall be assumed. Such regulations shall be\\npublished for comment at least thirty days in advance of their\\npromulgation and shall be filed with the secretary of state at least\\nsixty days in advance of the date of assumption of responsibilities;\\nprovided, however, that with respect to a particular district the\\nrequirements for advance publications and/or filing may be waived, or\\nthe time limits reduced, with the written consent of the district to\\nsuch waiver or reduction. Providers of medical care and services shall\\nsubmit claims to the social services district for all items of care,\\nservices and supplies furnished prior to the date of state assumption of\\npayment responsibilities and to the state for all such items furnished\\nsubsequent to such date. Such regulations shall also specify a final\\ntransition date after which any claiming submitted shall be enforceable\\nby such provider only against the state and shall not be enforceable by\\nsuch provider against the social services district; provided, however,\\nthat the department and the district may enter into a written agreement\\nby which the department agrees on the basis of eligibility information\\nprovided by such district to pay claims submitted to such district prior\\nto the final transition date.\\n  3. Upon notice to a social services district in accordance with\\nsubdivision two, that the department intends to assume payment\\nresponsibilities on behalf of such district, (a) such district shall\\npromptly submit to the department requested information regarding each\\nperson who applies for or has been determined eligible for medical\\nassistance and each provider of medical assistance in such district; and\\n(b) notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (b) of subdivision three\\nof section three hundred sixty-six-a of this chapter, the department\\nshall provide each person found by such district to be eligible for\\nmedical assistance under this title with a medical assistance\\nidentification card.\\n  4. Information relating to persons applying for or receiving medical\\nassistance shall be considered confidential and shall not be disclosed\\nto persons or agencies other than those considered entitled to such\\ninformation in accordance with section one hundred thirty-six when such\\ndisclosure is necessary for the proper administration of public\\nassistance programs.\\n  5. By no later than forty-five days following the end of each calendar\\nquarter after the second quarter of calendar year nineteen hundred\\nseventy-six, the department shall, until full implementation has been\\nachieved in all social services districts, report to the governor and\\nthe legislature regarding the current status of the medical assistance\\ninformation and payment system, summarizing the progress achieved during\\nthe previous quarter and the anticipated major achievements of the\\nsucceeding two calendar quarters. The report shall include the current\\nand anticipated overall expenditure and staffing levels for functions\\nrelating to the system, and shall specify each district affected or\\nanticipated to be affected during the succeeding two calendar quarters\\nand summarize the manner in which each such district is, or is\\nanticipated to be, affected. In addition, the department shall prepare\\nand submit to the governor and the legislature a special report\\ndemonstrating the appropriateness and relative cost-effectiveness of\\nutilizing a fiscal intermediary.\\n  In addition, for the purpose of insuring the compatability of the\\nsystem servicing the district comprising the city of New York with the\\nsystem servicing all other social services districts in the state, the\\ndepartment shall prepare and submit to the governor and the legislature\\non or before March first, nineteen hundred seventy-eight, a special\\nreport and recommendation covering the appropriateness and relative cost\\neffectiveness of utilizing a fiscal intermediary or fiscal agent for all\\ndistricts other than the district comprising the city of New York.\\n  6. Each social services district shall be responsible for paying to\\nthe state a share of the state's expenditures for claims of providers of\\nmedical assistance attributable to such district, which shall be equal\\nto the share of such expenditures such district would have borne after\\nreimbursement from state and federal funds in accordance with section\\nthree hundred sixty-eight-a of this chapter, had the expenditure been\\nmade by such district; provided, however, that no district shall be\\nresponsible for the state's expenditures for the administrative costs of\\ndeveloping, maintaining or operating the statewide medical assistance\\ninformation and payment system; and provided, further, that no district\\nshall be responsible for paying to the state any portion of the cost of\\nmedical assistance which the department is responsible for furnishing\\npursuant to section three hundred sixty-five of this chapter.\\n  7. In any case in which the department has made payments for medical\\nassistance on behalf of a social services district pursuant to this\\nsection, the commissioner on behalf of the social services official\\nshall be empowered to bring actions to recover the cost of such\\nassistance, pursuant to this subdivision and the provisions of title six\\nof article three of this chapter.\\n  8. (a) For the purpose of orderly and timely implementation of the\\nmedical assistance information and payment system, the department is\\nhereby authorized to enter into agreements with fiscal intermediaries or\\nfiscal agents for the design, development, implementation, operation,\\nprocessing, auditing and making of payments, subject to audits being\\nconducted by the state in accordance with the terms of such agreements,\\nfor medical assistance claims under the system described by this section\\nin any social services district. Such agreements shall specifically\\nprovide that the state shall have complete oversight responsibility for\\nthe fiscal intermediaries' or fiscal agents' performance and shall be\\nsolely responsible for establishing eligibility requirements for\\nrecipients, provider qualifications, rates of payment, investigation of\\nsuspected fraud and abuse, issuance of identification cards,\\nestablishing and maintaining recipient eligibility files, provider\\nprofiles, and conducting state audits of the fiscal intermediaries' or\\nagents' at least once annually. The system described in this subdivision\\nshall be operated by one or more fiscal intermediaries or fiscal agents\\nin accordance with this subdivision unless the department is otherwise\\nauthorized by a law enacted subsequent to the effective date of this\\nsubdivision to operate the system in another manner. In no event shall\\nsuch intermediary or agent be a political subdivision of the state or\\nany other governmental agency or entity. Notwithstanding the foregoing,\\nthe department may make payments to a provider upon the commissioner's\\ndetermination that the provider is temporarily unable to comply with\\nbilling requirements. The department shall consult with the office of\\nMedicaid inspector general regarding any activities undertaken by the\\nfiscal intermediaries or fiscal agents regarding investigation of\\nsuspected fraud and abuse.\\n  (b) The department of health, in consultation with the office of\\nMedicaid inspector general, shall develop, test and implement new\\nmethods to strengthen the capability of the medical assistance\\ninformation and payment system to detect and control fraud and improve\\nexpenditure accountability, and is hereby authorized to enter into\\nfurther agreements with fiscal and/or information technology agents for\\nthe development, testing and implementation of such new methods. Any\\nsuch agreements shall be with agents which have demonstrated expertise\\nin the areas addressed by the agreement. Such methods shall, at a\\nminimum, address the following areas:\\n  (1) Prepayment claims review. Develop, test and implement an automated\\nclaims review process which, prior to payment, shall subject medical\\nassistance program services claims to review for proper coding and such\\nother review as may be deemed necessary. Services subject to review\\nshall be based on: the expected cost-effectiveness of reviewing such\\nservice; the capabilities of the automated system for conducting such a\\nreview; and the potential to implement such review with negligible\\neffect on the turnaround of claims for provider payment or on recipient\\naccess to necessary services. Such initiative shall be designed to\\nprovide for the efficient and effective operation of the medical\\nassistance program claims payment system by performing functions\\nincluding, but not limited to, capturing coding errors, misjudgments,\\nincorrect or multiple billing for the same service and possible excesses\\nin billing or service use, whether intentional or unintentional.\\n  (2) Coordination of benefits. Develop, test and implement an automated\\nprocess to improve the coordination of benefits between the medical\\nassistance program and other sources of coverage for medical assistance\\nrecipients. Such initiative shall initially examine the savings\\npotential to the medical assistance program through retrospective review\\nof claims paid which shall be completed not later than January\\nthirty-first, two thousand seven. If, based upon such initial\\nexperience, the Medicaid inspector general deems the automated process\\nto be capable of including or moving to a prospective review, with\\nnegligible effect on the turnaround of claims for provider payment or on\\nrecipient access to services, then the Medicaid inspector general in\\nsubsequent tests shall examine the savings potential through\\nprospective, pre-claims payment review.\\n  (3) Comprehensive review of paid claims. Take all reasonable and\\nnecessary actions to intensify the state's current level of monitoring,\\nanalyzing, reporting and responding to medical assistance program claims\\ndata maintained by the state's medical assistance information and\\npayment system contract agents. Pursuant to this initiative, the\\ndepartment of health, in collaboration with the office of Medicaid\\ninspector general, shall make efforts to improve the utilization of such\\ndata in order to better identify fraud and abuse within the medical\\nassistance program and to identify and implement further program and\\npatient care reforms for the improvement of such program. In addition,\\nthe department of health, in consultation with such contract agents and\\nthe office of Medicaid inspector general, shall identify additional data\\nelements that are maintained and otherwise accessible by the state,\\ndirectly or through any of its contractors, that would, if coordinated\\nwith medical assistance data, further increase the effectiveness of data\\nanalysis for the management of the medical assistance program. To\\nfurther the objectives of this subparagraph, the department of health,\\nin collaboration with the office of Medicaid inspector general, shall\\nprovide or arrange in-service training for state and county medical\\nassistance personnel to increase the capability for state and local data\\nanalysis, leading to a more cost-effective operation of the medical\\nassistance program.\\n  (4) Targeted claims and utilization review. Develop, test and\\nimplement an automated process for the targeted review of claims,\\nservices and/or populations not later than January thirty-first, two\\nthousand seven.  Such review shall be for the purposes of identifying\\nstatistical aberrations in the use or billing of such services and for\\nassisting in the development and implementation of measures to ensure\\nthat service use and billing are appropriate to recipients' needs.\\n  (c) The commissioner of health shall prepare and submit an interim\\nreport to the governor and legislature on the implementation of the\\ninitiatives specified in paragraph (b) of this subdivision no later than\\nDecember first, two thousand seven. Such report shall also include\\nrecommendations for any revisions that would further facilitate the\\ngoals of such paragraph, including recommendations for expansion. In\\naddition, the commissioner of health shall submit a final report not\\nlater than December first, two thousand eight. In preparing such interim\\nand final reports, the commissioner of health shall consult with the\\nMedicaid inspector general, third-party agents, providers and recipients\\nassociated with the implementation of paragraph (b) of this subdivision.\\n  9. (a) In order to accomplish a more orderly transition to the medical\\nassistance information and payment system authorized by this section,\\nand to continue for a limited transition period the rate at which\\nadvanced revenues have been made available by local governmental units\\nto certain hospitals providing services to persons eligible for medical\\nassistance, the department is authorized to promulgate regulations\\nestablishing a system of accelerated payments to hospitals meeting the\\ncriteria set forth in this section.\\n  (b) Such system of accelerated payments shall only be available to a\\ngeneral hospital, other than a public general hospital:\\n  (i) which prior to January first, nineteen hundred seventy-eight\\nreceived regular, periodic and recurring advanced revenues from a local\\ngovernmental unit, the amount of which was based on anticipated medical\\nassistance claims payments; and\\n  (ii) which has demonstrated that its continued financial viability\\ndepends in substantial part on the rate at which such advanced revenues\\nwere made available by local governmental units prior to the time the\\ndepartment, pursuant to this section, assumed payment for such hospital\\nresponsibilities on behalf of the social services district in which it\\nis located, taking into account any funds remaining available from the\\nlocal governmental unit under its system of advanced revenues. For\\npurposes of this subdivision, it shall be presumed that a hospital does\\nnot depend in substantial part on the rate at which advanced revenues\\nwere made available by a local governmental unit if it received such\\nrevenues for a period of less than nine months preceding the month in\\nwhich the department assumed payment responsibilities for such hospital;\\n  (iii) for which payment responsibility is initially assumed by the\\ndepartment pursuant to this section during the period beginning June\\nfirst, nineteen hundred seventy-eight and ending November thirtieth,\\nnineteen hundred seventy-eight; and\\n  (iv) which meets performance criteria established by department\\nregulation relating to the ratio of acceptable claims for patient days\\nsubmitted for medical assistance payment compared to the total patient\\ndays of the hospital and compared to such claims submitted in one or\\nmore previous months, and the time lapse between the date the service\\nwas provided and the date the claim was submitted.\\n  (c) The regulations promulgated by the department pursuant to\\nparagraph (a) of this subdivision shall provide that the amount of the\\naccelerated payment for any month shall be determined for each hospital\\nmeeting the criteria set forth in this section on the basis of\\nacceptable medical assistance claims submitted by the hospital in one or\\nmore previous months and the amount of accelerated revenues made\\navailable to the hospital by a local governmental unit prior to the time\\nthe department assumed payment responsibilities for the hospital. The\\namount of the accelerated payment for any given month shall not exceed\\nthe amount of a monthly aggregate claim to be submitted by the hospital\\nto the department, which claim shall reflect items of care, services and\\nsupplies authorized under the medical assistance program pursuant to\\nthis title which are in fact provided prior to the date of the aggregate\\nclaim to persons who have been determined eligible for medical\\nassistance, or based on the past performance of the hospital are likely\\nto be determined eligible for medical assistance, when no other source\\nof payment including third party health insurance and payments pursuant\\nto title eighteen of the Federal Social Security Act are available for\\nsuch items of care, service and supplies. Such aggregate claims shall be\\nsubject to the audit and warrant of the state comptroller.\\n  (d) Any schedule of accelerated payments established by the department\\npursuant to this section shall assure that such payments are made for a\\nperiod of no more than six months from the month in which the department\\nassumes payment responsibility for the hospital, and shall provide for\\nrepayment of any amounts in excess of current audited claims, through\\nreductions in current claims, at a rate that will assure full repayment\\nat the earliest time consistent with the purposes of this section, but\\nin no event more than twenty-four months following the month in which\\nthe department assumes payment responsibilities for the hospital.\\nHowever, where the commissioner of health has determined with the\\nconcurrence of the state hospital review and planning council that a\\nhospital has satisfied the department of health regulations and is or\\nhas been authorized to participate in the emergency hospital\\nreimbursement program pursuant to which repayment of all or part of any\\naccelerated payments made by the department have been deferred in\\naccordance with such regulations, notwithstanding the time limitations\\nset forth above repayment of such deferred amounts shall be made in\\naccordance with an orderly schedule of repayment established by the\\ncommissioner of health after consultation with the commissioner. In no\\nevent shall any reduction be made against current claims, grant funds or\\nany amounts due said hospital in settlement of rate appeals, claims or\\nlawsuits to satisfy such repayment obligations.\\n  (e) In making accelerated payments pursuant to this subdivision and\\ndepartment regulations, the department shall utilize federal funds made\\navailable, and local funds, for such purposes or for purposes of payment\\nby the department of medical assistance payments pursuant to this\\nsection.\\n  * 10. a. For the purpose of timely payment, the department is hereby\\nauthorized to develop a concurrent payment system for general hospitals\\nwhich elect to participate in the concurrent payment system and which\\nare included in the payment component of the medical assistance\\ninformation and payment system, and to promulgate regulations to govern\\nsuch a system. The department may implement the concurrent payment\\nsystem for any general hospital which has elected to participate and for\\nwhich the department has chosen to implement the system.\\n  b. For all participating general hospitals the department shall\\ndetermine a biweekly concurrent payment which shall equal one\\ntwenty-sixth of the portion of the hospital's imputed or certified\\ninpatient revenue cap (as defined in section twenty-eight hundred\\nseven-a of the public health law) allocated for medical assistance\\npayments. The concurrent payment shall be reviewed at the beginning of\\neach quarter and adjusted to reflect any changes to the inpatient\\nrevenue cap or portion allocated for medical assistance payments.\\n  c. The department shall promulgate regulations, consistent with\\nfederal requirements for participation, governing the concurrent payment\\nsystem.  The regulations shall address, among other things, the method\\nof calculating the concurrent payment, the method of reconciliation, the\\nadjustment of the concurrent payment for the calculated difference, the\\nmanner of eliminating underpayments or overpayments to hospitals in\\nexceptional circumstances such as significantly changing utilization,\\nchanges in bed or service capacity, or imminent insolvency. The\\ndepartment shall promulgate regulations establishing a procedure for\\nrecognizing open cases as of the date of reconciliation. The department\\nshall also promulgate regulations setting forth standards for the\\ntimeliness and quality of billings and may lower the concurrent payment\\ncalculated in accordance with paragraph b of this subdivision for\\nnoncompliance with such regulations.\\n  d. Any payment claims made to the department for days of inpatient\\ncare provided prior to the effective date of this subdivision shall be\\npaid or denied in accordance with department regulations in effect when\\nthe care was provided.\\n  e. For any general hospital which is not afforded the opportunity of\\nparticipating in the concurrent payment system and which is in\\ncompliance with the billing requirements of the department, the\\ndepartment shall pay any financing or working capital charge levied by\\nthe hospital as authorized in section twenty-eight hundred seven-a of\\nthe public health law.\\n  f. This subdivision shall be effective only if federal participation\\nis available.\\n  * NB Expires January 1, 1986\\n  11. a. For the purpose of timely payment, the department is hereby\\nauthorized to develop a concurrent payment system for general hospitals\\nwhich elect to participate in the concurrent payment system and which\\nare included in the payment component of the medical assistance\\ninformation and payment system, and to promulgate regulations to govern\\nsuch a system. The department may implement the concurrent payment\\nsystem for any general hospital which has elected to participate and for\\nwhich the department has chosen to implement the system.\\n  b. For all participating general hospitals the department shall\\ndetermine a biweekly concurrent payment which shall equal one\\ntwenty-sixth of the hospital's estimated yearly inpatient revenue from\\nmedical assistance payments. The concurrent payment shall be reviewed at\\nthe beginning of each quarter and adjusted to reflect any changes to the\\nrates for medical assistance payments.\\n  c. The department shall promulgate regulations, consistent with\\nfederal requirements for participation, governing the concurrent payment\\nsystem.  The regulations shall address, among other things, the method\\nof calculating the concurrent payment, the method of reconciliation, the\\nadjustment of the concurrent payment for the calculated difference, the\\nmanner of eliminating underpayments or overpayments to hospitals in\\nexceptional circumstances such as significantly changing utilization,\\nchanges in bed or service capacity, or imminent insolvency. The\\ndepartment shall promulgate regulations establishing a procedure for\\nrecognizing open cases as of the date of reconciliation. The department\\nshall promulgate regulations setting forth standards for the timeliness\\nand quality of billings and may lower the concurrent payment calculated\\nin accordance with paragraph b of this subdivision for noncompliance\\nwith such regulations.\\n  d. Any payment claims made to the department for days of inpatient\\ncare provided prior to the effective date of this subdivision shall be\\npaid or denied in accordance with department regulations in effect when\\nthe care was provided.\\n  e. For any general hospital which is not afforded the opportunity of\\nparticipating in the concurrent payment system and which is in\\ncompliance with the billing requirements of the department, the\\ndepartment shall pay any financing or working capital charge levied by\\nthe hospital as authorized in section twenty-eight hundred seven-a of\\nthe public health law.\\n  f. This subdivision shall be effective only if federal participation\\nis available.\\n  12. (a) For the purpose of regulating cash flow for general hospitals,\\nthe department shall develop and implement a payment methodology to\\nprovide for timely payments for inpatient hospital services eligible for\\ncase based payments per discharge based on diagnosis-related groups\\nprovided during the period January first, nineteen hundred eighty-eight\\nthrough March thirty-first two thousand twenty, by such hospitals which\\nelect to participate in the system.\\n  (b) In developing a payment methodology the department shall consider\\na system under which hospitals may be reimbursed on the basis of\\ninpatient admissions, adjusted to payment on the basis of discharge\\ndata, with reconciliations established at time periods specified by the\\ndepartment.  Under such a system variances between amounts paid on an\\nadmission basis and actual amounts due and to be paid on a discharge\\nbasis may be reflected in the amounts to be paid in a subsequent period.\\n  13.

Should funds otherwise payable to a local social\\nservices district from appropriations made to the office of temporary\\nand disability assistance, the office of children and family services,\\nand the department of health be insufficient to fully fund the amounts\\nidentified by the commissioner of health as necessary to liquidate the\\nlocal share of payments to be made pursuant to this section on behalf of\\nthe local social services district, the commissioner of health may\\nidentify other state or federal payments payable to that local social\\nservices district or any other county agency including, but not limited\\nto the county department of health, from appropriations made to the\\nstate department of health, and may authorize the state comptroller,\\nupon no less than five days written notice to such local social services\\ndistrict or such other county agency, to set-aside such payments in the\\ninterest-bearing account with such interest accruing to the credit of\\nthe locality. Upon such determination by the commissioner of health that\\ninsufficient funds are payable to a local social services district and\\nany other county agency receiving payments from the office of temporary\\nand disability assistance, the office of children and family services,\\nand the state department of health from appropriations made to these\\nagencies, the state comptroller shall, upon no less than five days\\nwritten notice to such local social services district or such other\\ncounty agency, withhold payments from any of the general fund - local\\nassistance accounts or payments made from any of the special revenue -\\nfederal local assistance accounts, provided, however, that such federal\\npayments shall be withheld only after such federal funds are properly\\ncredited to the county through vouchers, claims or other warrants\\nproperly received, approved, and paid by the state comptroller, and\\nset-aside such disbursements in the interest-bearing account with such\\ninterest accruing to the credit of the locality until such time that the\\namount withheld from each county is determined by the commissioner of\\nhealth to be sufficient to fully liquidate the local share of payments,\\nas estimated by the commissioner of health, to be made pursuant to this\\nsection on behalf of that local social services district.\\n  14. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, effective on or before\\nJanuary first, two thousand one, the local social services district\\nshare of medical assistance payments made by the state on behalf of the\\nlocal social services district shall be paid to the state by the local\\nsocial services district using electronic funds transfer under the\\nsupervision of the state comptroller and pursuant to rules and\\nregulations of the commissioner of health.

If a long\\nterm home health care program as defined under article thirty-six of the\\npublic health law is provided in the social services district for which\\nhe has authority, the local social services official, before he\\nauthorizes care in a nursing home or intermediate care facility for a\\nperson eligible to receive services under this title, shall notify the\\nperson in writing of the provisions of this section.\\n  2. If a person eligible to receive services under the provisions of\\nthis title who requires care, treatment, maintenance, nursing or other\\nservices in a nursing home desires to remain and is deemed by his\\nphysician able to remain in his own home or the home of a responsible\\nrelative or other responsible adult if the necessary services are\\nprovided, such person or his representative shall so inform the local\\nsocial services official. If a long term home health care program as\\ndefined under article thirty-six of the public health law is provided in\\nthe social services district for which he has authority, such official\\nshall authorize an assessment under the provisions of section thirty-six\\nhundred sixteen of the public health law. If the results of the\\nassessment indicate that the person can receive the appropriate level of\\ncare at home, the official shall prepare for that person a plan for the\\nprovision of services comparable to those that would be rendered in a\\nnursing home. In developing such plan, the official shall consult with\\nthose persons performing the assessment. The services shall be provided\\nby a certified home health agency, hospital, or residential health care\\nfacility authorized by the commissioner of health under article\\nthirty-six of the public health law to provide a long term home health\\ncare program. At the time of the initial assessment, and at the time of\\neach subsequent assessment performed under the provisions of section\\nthirty-six hundred sixteen of the public health law, or more often if\\nthe person's needs require, the official shall establish a monthly\\nbudget in accordance with which he shall authorize payment for the\\nservices provided under such plan. Total monthly expenditures made under\\nthis title for such person shall not exceed a maximum of seventy-five\\nper cent, or such lesser percentage as may be determined by the\\ncommissioner, of the average of the monthly rates payable under this\\ntitle for nursing home services within the social services district for\\nwhich the official has authority. However, if a continuing assessment of\\nthe person's needs demonstrates that he requires increased services, the\\nsocial services official may authorize the expenditure of any amount\\naccrued under this section during the past twelve months as a result of\\nthe expenditures for that person not exceeding such maximum. If an\\nassessment of the person's needs demonstrates that he requires services\\nthe payment for which would exceed such monthly maximum, but it can be\\nreasonably anticipated that total expenditures for required services for\\nsuch person will not exceed such maximum calculated over a one year\\nperiod, the social services official may authorize payment for such\\nservices.\\n  3. If a person eligible to receive services under the provisions of\\nthis title who requires health related care and services in an\\nintermediate care facility desires to remain and is deemed by his\\nphysician able to remain in his own home or the home of a responsible\\nrelative or other responsible adult if the necessary services are\\nprovided, such person or his representative shall so inform the local\\nsocial services official.  If a long term home health care program as\\ndefined under article thirty-six of the public health law is provided in\\nthe social services district for which he has authority, such official\\nshall authorize an assessment under the provisions of section thirty-six\\nhundred sixteen of the public health law.

The services shall\\nbe provided by a certified home health agency, hospital, or residential\\nhealth care facility authorized by the commissioner of health under\\narticle thirty-six of the public health law to provide a long term home\\nhealth care program. At the time of the initial assessment and at the\\ntime of each subsequent assessment performed under the provisions of\\nsection thirty-six hundred sixteen of the public health law, or more\\noften if the person's needs require, the official shall establish a\\nmonthly budget in accordance with which he shall authorize payment for\\nthe services provided under that plan. Total monthly expenditures made\\nunder this title for such person shall not exceed a maximum of\\nseventy-five per cent, or such lesser percentage as may be determined by\\nthe commissioner, of the average of the monthly rates paid under this\\ntitle for the provision of health related care and services in\\nintermediate care facilities within the social services district for\\nwhich the official has authority. However, if a continuing assessment of\\nthe person's needs demonstrates that he requires increased services, the\\nsocial services official may authorize the expenditure of any amount\\naccrued under this section during the past twelve months as a result of\\nthe expenditures for that person not exceeding such maximum. If an\\nassessment of the person's needs demonstrates that he requires services\\nthe payment for which would exceed such monthly maximum, but it can be\\nreasonably anticipated that total expenditures for required services for\\nsuch person will not exceed such maximum calculated over a one year\\nperiod, the social services official may authorize payment for such\\nservices.\\n  3-a. (a) Notwithstanding any inconsistent provision of this section,\\nthe commissioner is authorized and directed to establish a demonstration\\nprogram for the purpose of determining the impact of raising the\\nlimitation on expenditures for the delivery of long term home health\\ncare services to persons with special needs as defined in this\\nsubdivision. Pursuant to such program, the commissioner shall permit\\nlocal social services officials to authorize, at their discretion, and\\nonly after a determination that the maximum expenditure available\\npursuant to subdivisions two and three of this section is not sufficient\\nto provide or continue to provide long term home health care services to\\npersons with special needs, maximum monthly expenditures for services\\nunder this title to such persons, not to exceed one hundred percent of\\nthe average of the monthly rates payable under this title for services\\nin a nursing home or intermediate care facility within the social\\nservices district for which the social services official has authority.\\nHowever, if a continuing assessment of a person with special needs\\ndemonstrates that he requires increased services, the social services\\nofficial may authorize the expenditure of any amount accrued under this\\nsection during the past twelve months as a result of the expenditures\\nfor that person not having exceeded such maximum. If an assessment of a\\nperson with special needs demonstrates that he requires increased\\nservices the payment for which would exceed such monthly maximum, but it\\ncan be reasonably anticipated that total expenditures for required\\nservices for such person will not exceed such maximum calculated over a\\none year period, the social services official may authorize payment for\\nsuch services.\\n  (b) As used in this subdivision, the term \"person with special needs\"\\nshall mean a person for whom a plan of care has been developed pursuant\\nto subdivision two or three of this section who (1) needs care including\\nbut not limited to respiratory therapy, tube feeding, decubitus care or\\ninsulin therapy which cannot be appropriately provided by a personal\\ncare aide as defined in regulations issued by the commissioner, or (2)\\nhas one or more of the following conditions: mental disability as\\ndefined in section 1.03 of the mental hygiene law, acquired immune\\ndeficiency syndrome, or dementias, including Alzheimer's disease.\\n  (c) The number of persons with special needs for whom a local social\\nservices official may authorize payment for services pursuant to\\nparagraph (a) of this subdivision shall be limited to twenty-five\\npercent of the total number of persons, all long term home health care\\nprograms, within a social services district are authorized to serve;\\nprovided, however, in any district containing a city having a population\\nof one million or more, such limit shall be fifteen percent.\\n  (d) In the event that a district reaches the limitation specified in\\nparagraph (c) of this subdivision, the local social services official\\nmay, upon the approval of the commissioner, authorize payment for\\nservices, pursuant to paragraph (a) of this subdivision, for additional\\npersons with special needs.\\n  4. Notwithstanding any inconsistent provision of this section, if two\\nmembers of this same household, eligible to receive services under this\\ntitle, require care and services in either a nursing home or an\\nintermediate care facility, and assessments conducted pursuant to the\\nprovisions of this section indicate that such persons can receive the\\nappropriate level of care at home, then such care may be provided at\\nhome where total monthly expenditures made under this title for such\\npersons shall not exceed a maximum of seventy-five percent, or such\\nlesser percentage as may be determined by the commissioner, of the\\nmonthly rates which would be payable under this title for both members\\nof the household for nursing home and/or intermediate care facility\\nservices within the social services district. If assessments of such\\npersons' needs demonstrate that they require services the payment for\\nwhich would exceed such monthly maximum, but it can be reasonably\\nanticipated that total expenditures for required services for such\\npersons will not exceed the maximum calculated over a one year period, a\\nsocial services official may authorize payment for such services.\\n  5. If a person eligible to receive services under the provisions of\\nthis title who is medically eligible for care, treatment, maintenance,\\nnursing or other services in a nursing home or is medically eligible for\\nhealth related care and services in an intermediate care facility\\ndesires to and is deemed by his or her physician able to remain in an\\nadult care facility, other than a shelter for adults, which is able and\\nwilling to retain such person if the necessary services are provided,\\nsuch person or his or her representatives shall so inform the local\\nsocial services official. If a long term home health care program is\\nprovided in a social services district, an official of such district\\nshall authorize an assessment under the provisions of section three\\nthousand six hundred sixteen of the public health law. If the results of\\nthe assessment indicate that the person can receive the appropriate\\nlevel of care at such location, and meets the appropriate standards for\\ncontinued stay for such facility as are established by law and\\nregulation, such official shall prepare for that person a plan for the\\nprovision of services. In developing such plan, the official shall\\nconsult with those persons performing the assessment and with the\\noperator of the adult care facility. The services shall be provided by a\\nlong term home health care program authorized pursuant to article\\nthirty-six of the public health law, provided, however that\\nnotwithstanding the provisions of section three thousand six hundred\\nsixteen of such law, services shall not be provided prior to the\\ncompletion of the assessment. At the time of the initial assessment and\\nat the time of each subsequent assessment performed under the provisions\\nof section three thousand six hundred sixteen of the public health law,\\nor more often if the person's needs require, the official shall\\nestablish a monthly budget in accordance with which he shall authorize\\npayment for the services provided under that plan, provided, however\\nthat no services shall be authorized in the plan which the operator of\\nthe facility is required by law and regulation to provide. The long term\\nhome health care program providing services authorized in such plan\\nshall be solely responsible for managing and providing or arranging for\\nsuch authorized services. The operator of the adult care facility shall\\nbe solely responsible for managing and providing those services which\\nthe facility is required by law or regulation to provide. However, the\\ntwo entities shall collaborate to assure coordination. Total monthly\\nexpenditures made under this title for such person shall not exceed a\\nmaximum of fifty percent, or such lesser percentage as may be determined\\nby the commissioner, of the average of the monthly rates paid under this\\ntitle for the provision of nursing home services or health related care\\nand services in intermediate care facilities, whichever is appropriate,\\nwithin the social services district for which the official has\\nauthority. However, if a continuing assessment of the person's needs\\ndemonstrates that he or she requires increased services, the social\\nservices official may authorize the expenditure of any amount accrued\\nunder this section during the past twelve months as a result of the\\nexpenditures for that person not exceeding such maximum. If an\\nassessment of the person's needs demonstrates that he or she requires\\nservices the payment for which would exceed such monthly maximum, but it\\ncan be reasonably anticipated that total expenditures for required\\nservices for such person will not exceed such maximum calculated over a\\none year period, the social services official may authorize payment for\\nsuch services. The provisions of this subdivision shall not be deemed to\\nalter standards for admission to an adult care facility nor shall the\\nadmission of a person into such facility be contingent on such person's\\nenrollment in a long term home health care program.\\n  6. Notwithstanding any inconsistent provision of law but subject to\\nexpenditure limitations of this section, the commissioner, subject to\\nthe approval of the state director of the budget, may authorize the\\nutilization of medical assistance funds to pay for services provided by\\nspecified long term home health care programs in addition to those\\nservices included in the medical assistance program under section three\\nhundred sixty-five-a of this chapter, so long as federal financial\\nparticipation is available for such services. Expenditures made under\\nthis subdivision shall be deemed payments for medical assistance for\\nneedy persons and shall be subject to reimbursement by the state in\\naccordance with the provisions of section three hundred sixty-eight-a of\\nthis chapter.\\n  7. No social services district shall make payments pursuant to title\\nXIX of the federal Social Security Act for benefits available under\\ntitle XVIII of such act without documentation that title XVIII claims\\nhave been filed and denied.\\n  8. No social services district shall make payment for a person\\nreceiving a long term home health care program while payments are being\\nmade for that person for inpatient care in a residential health care\\nfacility or hospital.\\n  9. The commissioner, together with the commissioner of health, shall\\nsubmit a report to the governor, president pro tem of the senate and\\nspeaker of the assembly by the first day of February, nineteen hundred\\neighty, on the implementation of this section. Such report shall include\\na statement of the scope and status of long term home health care\\nprograms, the extent to which such programs have affected\\ninstitutionalization, the costs associated with such programs, any\\nrecommendations for legislative action, and such other matters as may be\\npertinent.\\n  10.

                  "text" : "  * § 370-aa. State heating fuel crisis assistance. 1. The commissioner\\nshall establish a state program to provide heating fuel related crisis\\nassistance to households whose total income from all sources is between\\none hundred twenty-five percent and two hundred percent of the federal\\ncommunity services administration poverty guidelines and who have not\\nreceived a grant for heating fuel assistance during the nineteen hundred\\nseventy-nine--nineteen hundred eighty winter from any other emergency or\\nenergy assistance program. To the extent funds are available, such\\nhousehold may apply and be eligible for assistance if the household is\\nthreatened with shut-off or nondelivery of heating fuel due to\\nnonpayment and in the case of a one person household, the household's\\nliquid resources do not exceed one thousand five hundred dollars or in\\nthe case of households of more than one person liquid resources do not\\nexceed two thousand two hundred fifty dollars. Liquid resources shall\\nmean those resources which are in cash or are financial instruments\\nwhich are convertible to cash.\\n  2. Eligible households with incomes between one hundred twenty-five\\npercent and one hundred fifty percent of the federal community services\\nadministration poverty guidelines may receive a total benefit not to\\nexceed two hundred dollars; eligible households with incomes between one\\nhundred fifty per cent and one hundred seventy-five percent of the\\nfederal community services administration poverty guidelines may receive\\na total benefit not to exceed one hundred fifty dollars; and eligible\\nhouseholds with incomes between one hundred seventy-five percent and two\\nhundred percent of the federal community services administration poverty\\nguidelines may receive a total benefit not to exceed one hundred\\ndollars. Eligible households which pay for heat directly may receive\\nbenefits in the form of direct payment to suppliers of home heating\\nfuels. All households may receive assistance in the form of cash up to\\nfifty dollars for warm clothing, blankets, replacement of broken window\\npanes, firewood, temporary shelter, emergency repairs to heating\\nequipment, nutrition, health and other supportive services. In no event\\nshall the sum of assistance under this program made to or on behalf of\\nany household exceed the actual amount needed to ameliorate the heating\\nfuel crisis.\\n  3. a. Assistance may also be provided to households whose rent\\nincludes heat. Such assistance may be provided only in the event that\\nthe owner of the rented dwelling has abandoned responsibility for paying\\nheating costs. Such assistance may be in the form of emergency heating\\nfuel deliveries.\\n  b. Such assistance shall be provided for a period not to exceed\\nfifteen days, in order to allow time for appropriate action to be taken\\nby city or county officials.\\n  c. In such cases where the landlord or owner has abandoned his\\nresponsibility for paying heating costs, and where tenants or landlords\\ncan verify that at least sixty percent of the building's households are\\nat or below two hundred percent of the federal community services\\nadministration poverty guidelines, the buildings may qualify.\\n  d. The department shall make all reasonable efforts to recover from\\nthe landlord, emergency expenditures for heating fuel.\\n  4. This program shall be administered at the county level and in the\\ncity of New York by the local departments of social services. Local\\ndepartments shall distribute funds allocated for heating fuel crisis\\nassistance to eligible households for the payment of heating fuel costs\\nas described in subdivisions two and three of this section. The\\ndepartment shall prepare application forms for use by the local\\ndepartments and instructions to be used in completing applications.\\nCertification of eligibility and authorization of payment shall be the\\nresponsibility of the local departments. The local departments shall\\nprovide for preliminary screening and assistance to applicants by\\ncommunity action agencies, area offices on aging and other community\\nagencies.\\n  5. The department and local departments shall contract for the\\nprovision of an outreach program to inform potentially eligible\\nhouseholds of the availability of heating fuel crisis assistance. The\\ndepartment shall enter into an agreement with the state office for the\\naging which will provide outreach to the elderly and with community\\naction agencies and other community based agencies for outreach to other\\npotentially eligible households. The department shall develop program\\nmaterials which will be made available to utilities, fuel oil dealers\\nand community agencies for the purpose of informing the public about the\\navailability of crisis assistance.\\n  6. Elderly persons over the age of sixty shall be a priority class to\\nbe served by this program. To insure the priority becomes operational,\\nlocal departments shall provide directly or when appropriate through\\ncontract the following special services to the elderly: priority in\\nscheduling appointments; arrangements for transportation when no other\\ntransportation is available; intake and certification at home or through\\na representative for those elderly who are homebound.\\n  7. Payments made under this program shall not be considered as income\\nor resource for the purpose of determining eligibility for benefits\\nunder any income maintenance or medical assistance program.\\n  8. The department shall be responsible for monitoring the local\\nimplementation of this program. All cases including a declaration of\\nincome shall be subject to a redetermination and verification of income\\neligibility. To insure that the elderly receive priority, the department\\nshall periodically review the population certified to receive benefits\\nand in districts where the elderly are not being served shall, with the\\nstate office for aging, take appropriate actions to ensure that the\\nelderly are served. The department and local districts shall maintain a\\nsystem of records for this program which is separate from any other\\nemergency or energy related assistance program.\\n  No later than July thirty-first, nineteen hundred eighty, the\\ndepartment shall provide the governor and legislature with a report on\\nthe state heating fuel crisis assistance program's implementation and\\nuse in each district. Such report shall include the total number of\\nhouseholds and the number of elderly households served in each income\\ncategory, the amount and type of assistance provided to each household\\nand the activities and expenditures for all administering and outreach\\nagencies in each district.\\n  9. The department shall promulgate all regulations necessary for\\noperation of the state heating fuel crisis assistance program which are\\nconsistent with the state plan for the nineteen hundred eighty community\\nservices administration energy crisis assistance program.\\n  10. Within the amounts appropriated therefor funds will be made\\navailable to each social services district for heating fuel crisis\\nassistance. If a county or city social services district incurs\\nexpenditures in excess of its allocated amount, the county or city as\\nthe case may be shall be liable for such expenditures. Funds will be\\nallocated by the department according to the following formula: Five\\npercent of the funds shall be set aside by the department to be used in\\nmeeting any unanticipated heating fuel related crisis caused by\\nespecially severe weather. All remaining funds and set aside funds which\\nare unexpended by April first, nineteen hundred eighty shall be\\nallocated according to the following formula: Twenty percent of the\\nfunds shall be allocated equally to every county and the remaining\\neighty percent shall be allocated to the fifty-seven counties outside\\nthe city of New York and the city of New York based on the corrected\\nproduct of the percentage of state's poverty population residing in each\\ncounty, the average heating degree days for the county divided by the\\nstate average and the percentage of county population which is aged\\ndivided by the percentage of state population which is aged.\\n  When thirty percent of the funds are obligated the department will\\nreview the expenditures of program funds for the elderly with a view\\ntoward increasing outreach and support services if this priority\\npopulation is not being reached.\\n  When fifty percent of the funds are obligated, the department will\\nreview the initial allocation to determine variances in utilization and\\nmake appropriate adjustments or transfers.\\n  11. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the commissioner determines that\\na federally funded program of energy crisis assistance is in effect and\\nis duplicative in whole or part to the program provided for in this\\nsection the commissioner shall notify the local social services district\\nin writing of such determination of duplication and the date after which\\nstate reimbursement for all or part of the expenditures made pursuant to\\nthis section shall not be authorized.\\n  12. For purposes of this section, the term \"home heating fuel\" shall\\nmean fuel oil, coal, wood, propane, natural gas, electricity, steam,\\nkerosene and any other fuel when used for residential heating purposes.\\n  * NB Expired October 1, 1980\\n",

It is also the\\nintent of the legislature to encourage caregivers to allow foster\\nchildren to participate in such activities by providing training,\\nguidance, and appropriate liability protections when caregivers make\\nreasonable and prudent decisions with regard to such activities. It is\\nnot the intent of the legislature to relieve caregivers or any other\\nperson of any duty or responsibility owed to a foster child.\\n  2. Definitions.

For the purposes of this section, a child in foster care shall\\nmean a child in the care and custody of an authorized agency pursuant to\\nsection three hundred eighty-four-a of this title or article three,\\nseven or ten of the family court act. The guardianship of the person and\\nthe custody of a child in foster care under the age of eighteen years\\nmay be committed to an authorized agency by a written instrument which\\nshall be known as a surrender, and signed:\\n  (a) if both parents shall then be living, by the parents of such\\nchild, or by the surviving parent, if either parent of such child be\\ndead;\\n  (b) if either one of such parents shall have for a period of six\\nmonths then next preceding abandoned such child as set forth in section\\nthree hundred eighty-four-b of this title, by the other of such parents;\\n  (c) if such child is born out of wedlock, by the mother of such child,\\nand by the father of such child, if such father's consent would be\\nrequired for the child's adoption, pursuant to section one hundred\\neleven of the domestic relations law;\\n  (d) if both parents of such child are dead, or if such child is born\\nout of wedlock and the mother of such child is dead, by the guardian of\\nthe person of such child lawfully appointed, with the approval of the\\ncourt or officer which appointed such guardian to be entered of record.\\n  2. Terms. (a) Such guardianship shall be in accordance with the\\nprovisions of this article and the instrument shall be upon such terms\\nand subject to such conditions as may be agreed upon by the parties\\nthereto and shall comply with subdivision five of this section;\\nprovided, however, that an authorized agency shall not accept a\\nsurrender instrument conditioned upon adoption by a particular person,\\nunless such person is a certified or approved foster parent, where the\\npermanency plan for the child is for the child to be adopted by that\\nperson or the agency has fully investigated and approved such person as\\nan adoptive parent in accordance with applicable statute and\\nregulations. No such agency shall draw or receive money from public\\nfunds for the support of any such child except upon the written order or\\npermit of the social services official of the county or city sought to\\nbe charged with the support of such child.\\n  (b) If a surrender instrument designates a particular person or\\npersons who will adopt a child, such person or persons, the child's\\nbirth parent or parents, the authorized agency having care and custody\\nof the child and the child's attorney, may enter into a written\\nagreement providing for communication or contact between the child and\\nthe child's parent or parents on such terms and conditions as may be\\nagreed to by the parties.  If a surrender instrument does not designate\\na particular person or persons who will adopt the child, then the\\nchild's birth parent or parents, the authorized agency having care and\\ncustody of the child and the child's attorney may enter into a written\\nagreement providing for communication or contact, on such terms and\\nconditions as may be agreed to by the parties. Such agreement also may\\nprovide terms and conditions for communication with or contact between\\nthe child and the child's biological siblings or half-siblings, if any.\\nIf any such sibling or half-sibling is fourteen years of age or older,\\nsuch terms and conditions shall not be enforceable unless such sibling\\nor half-sibling consents to the agreement in writing. If the court\\nbefore which the surrender instrument is presented for approval\\ndetermines that the agreement concerning communication and contact is in\\nthe child's best interests, the court shall approve the agreement. If\\nthe court does not approve the agreement, the court may nonetheless\\napprove the surrender; provided, however, that the birth parent or\\nparents executing the surrender instrument shall be given the\\nopportunity at that time to withdraw such instrument. Enforcement of any\\nagreement prior to the adoption of the child shall be in accordance with\\nsubdivision (b) of section one thousand fifty-five-a of the family court\\nact. Subsequent to the adoption of the child, enforcement of any\\nagreement shall be in accordance with section one hundred twelve-b of\\nthe domestic relations law.\\n  3. Judicial surrenders. (a) A surrender of a child to an authorized\\nagency for the purpose of adoption may be executed and acknowledged\\nbefore a judge of the family court or a surrogate in this state. If the\\nchild being surrendered is in foster care as a result of a proceeding\\nbefore the family court pursuant to article ten or ten-A of the family\\ncourt act or section three hundred fifty-eight-a of this chapter, the\\nsurrender shall be executed and acknowledged before the family court\\nthat exercised jurisdiction over such proceeding and, shall be assigned,\\nwherever practicable, to the judge who last presided over such\\nproceeding. A surrender executed and acknowledged before a court in\\nanother state shall satisfy the requirements of this section if it is\\nexecuted by a resident of the other state before a court of record which\\nhas jurisdiction over adoption proceedings in that state, and a\\ncertified copy of the transcript of that proceeding, showing compliance\\nwith paragraph (b) of this subdivision, is filed as part of the adoption\\nproceeding in this state.\\n  (b) Before a judge or surrogate approves a judicial surrender, the\\njudge or surrogate shall order that notice of the surrender proceeding\\nbe given to persons identified in subdivision two of section three\\nhundred eighty-four-c of this title and to such other persons as the\\njudge or surrogate may, in his or her discretion, prescribe. At the time\\nthat a parent appears before a judge or surrogate to execute and\\nacknowledge a surrender, the judge or surrogate shall inform such parent\\nof the right to be represented by legal counsel of the parent's own\\nchoosing and of the right to obtain supportive counseling and of any\\nright to have counsel assigned pursuant to section two hundred sixty-two\\nof the family court act, section four hundred seven of the surrogate's\\ncourt procedure act, or section thirty-five of the judiciary law. The\\njudge or surrogate also shall inform the parent of the consequences of\\nsuch surrender, including informing such parent that the parent is\\ngiving up all rights to have custody, visit with, speak with, write to\\nor learn about the child, forever, unless the parties have agreed to\\ndifferent terms pursuant to subdivision two of this section, or, if the\\nparent registers with the adoption information register, as specified in\\nsection forty-one hundred thirty-eight-d of the public health law, that\\nthe parent may be contacted at any time after the child reaches the age\\nof eighteen years, but only if both the parent and the adult child so\\nchoose. The court shall determine whether the terms and conditions\\nagreed to by the parties pursuant to subdivision two of this section are\\nin the child's best interests before approving the surrender. The judge\\nor surrogate shall inform the parent that where a surrender containing\\nconditions has been executed, the parent is obligated to provide the\\nauthorized agency with a designated mailing address, as well as any\\nsubsequent changes in such address, at which the parent may receive\\nnotices regarding any substantial failure of a material condition,\\nunless such notification is expressly waived by a statement written by\\nthe parent and appended to or included in such instrument. The judge or\\nsurrogate also shall inform the parent that the surrender shall become\\nfinal and irrevocable immediately upon its execution and acknowledgment.\\nThe judge or surrogate shall give the parent a copy of such surrender\\nupon the execution thereof.\\n  4. Extra-judicial surrenders. (a) In any case where a surrender is not\\nexecuted and acknowledged before a judge or surrogate pursuant to\\nsubdivision three of this section, such surrender shall be executed and\\nacknowledged by the parent, in the presence of at least two witnesses,\\nbefore a notary public or other officer authorized to take proof of\\ndeeds. At least one witness shall be an employee of an authorized agency\\ntrained, in accordance with the regulations of the department of\\nchildren and family services, to receive surrenders. At least one\\nwitness shall be a person who is either a licensed master social worker,\\nlicensed clinical social worker or an attorney and who is not an\\nemployee, volunteer, consultant or agent of or attorney for the\\nauthorized agency to which the child is being surrendered. The\\ncommissioner of the office of children and family services, after\\nconsultation with the chief administrator of the courts, shall\\npromulgate standards to help ensure the impartial selection and\\nindependence of such witnesses. Any witness may, if so commissioned,\\nserve as notary under this subdivision.\\n  (b) The authorized agency to which the child was surrendered shall\\nfile an application for approval of the extra-judicial surrender with\\nthe court in which the adoption proceeding is expected to be filed or,\\nif not known, the family or surrogate's court in the county in which the\\nagency has its principal office. If the child being surrendered is in\\nfoster care as a result of a proceeding before the family court pursuant\\nto article ten or ten-A of the family court act or section three hundred\\nfifty-eight-a of this chapter, the application shall be filed in the\\nfamily court that exercised jurisdiction over such proceeding and, shall\\nbe assigned, wherever practicable, to the judge who last presided over\\nsuch proceeding. The application shall be filed no later than fifteen\\ndays after execution of such surrender. The application shall be\\naccompanied by affidavits from all the witnesses before whom the\\nsurrender was executed and acknowledged as provided for in paragraph (a)\\nof this subdivision, stating:\\n  (i) the date, time and place where the surrender was executed and\\nacknowledged;\\n  (ii) that the parent was provided with a copy of the surrender;\\n  (iii) that the surrender was read in full to the parent in his or her\\nprincipal language and the parent was given an opportunity to ask\\nquestions and obtain answers regarding the nature and consequences of\\nthe surrender, including the consequences of, and procedures to be\\nfollowed in, cases of a substantial failure of a material condition, if\\nany, contained in the surrender instrument and the obligation to provide\\nthe authorized agency with a designated mailing address, as well as any\\nsubsequent changes in such address, at which the parent may receive\\nnotices regarding any substantial failure of a material condition,\\nunless such notification is expressly waived by a statement written by\\nthe parent and appended to or included in such instrument; and\\n  (iv) that the parent executed and acknowledged the surrender.\\n  (c) The authorized agency to which a child is surrendered pursuant to\\nthis subdivision must affix an affidavit to the application, by an\\nemployee responsible for providing or arranging supportive counseling,\\nwhich specifies:\\n  (i) when supportive counseling was offered to the parent by the\\nauthorized agency;\\n  (ii) whether the parent accepted the offer of supportive counseling;\\nand\\n  (iii) if accepted, when supportive counseling was provided and the\\nnature of such supportive counseling.\\n  (d) Before a judge or surrogate approves an extra-judicial surrender,\\nthe judge or surrogate shall order notice to be given to the person who\\nexecuted the surrender, to persons identified in subdivision two of\\nsection three hundred eighty-four-c of this title and to such other\\npersons as the judge or surrogate may, in his or her discretion,\\nprescribe. The petition shall set forth the names and last known\\naddresses of all persons required to be given notice of the proceeding,\\npursuant to section three hundred eighty-four-c, and there shall be\\nshown by the petition or by affidavit or other proof satisfactory to the\\ncourt that there are no persons other than those set forth in the\\npetition who are entitled to notice pursuant to such section. No person\\nwho has received such notice and been afforded an opportunity to be\\nheard may challenge the validity of a surrender approved pursuant to\\nthis subdivision in any other proceeding. Nothing in this section shall\\nbe deemed to dispense with the consent to adopt if otherwise required of\\nany person who has not executed the surrender.\\n  (e) The agency to which the child is surrendered promptly shall notify\\nsuch court of any correspondence or communication received from the\\nparent or a person on the parent's behalf subsequent to the execution of\\nthe surrender and prior to a final order of adoption of the child, if\\nsuch correspondence or communication could reasonably indicate the\\nparent's wish to revoke the surrender.\\n  (f) The court shall enter an order either approving or disapproving\\nthe surrender. If the court disapproves the surrender, the surrender\\nshall be deemed a nullity and without force or effect, and the court may\\ndirect that any subsequent surrender shall be executed only before the\\ncourt in accordance with subdivision three of this section.\\n  5. Instrument.

The guardianship of the person and the custody of a child who is\\nnot in foster care under the age of eighteen years may be committed to\\nan authorized agency by a written instrument which shall be known as a\\nsurrender, and signed:\\n  (a) if both parents shall then be living, by the parents of such\\nchild, or by the surviving parent, if either parent of such child be\\ndead;\\n  (b) if either one of such parents shall have for a period of six\\nmonths then next preceding abandoned such child, by the other of such\\nparents;\\n  (c) if such child is born out of wedlock, by the mother of such child,\\nand by the father of such child, if such father's consent would be\\nrequired for the child's adoption, pursuant to section one hundred\\neleven of the domestic relations law;\\n  (d) if both parents of such child are dead, or if such child is born\\nout of wedlock and the mother of such child is dead by the guardian of\\nthe person of such child lawfully appointed, with the approval of the\\ncourt or officer which appointed such guardian to be entered of record.\\n  2. Terms. (a) Such guardianship shall be in accordance with the\\nprovisions of this article and the instrument shall be upon such terms\\nand subject to such conditions as may be agreed upon by the parties\\nthereto. The instrument shall recite that the authorized agency is\\nthereby authorized and empowered to consent to the adoption of such\\nchild in the place and stead of the person signing the instrument, and\\nmay recite that the person signing the instrument waives any notice of\\nsuch adoption; provided, however, that an authorized agency shall not\\naccept a surrender instrument conditioned upon adoption by a particular\\nperson, unless the agency has fully investigated and certified or\\napproved such person as a qualified adoptive parent. Any surrender\\ninstrument subject to the provisions of this section shall include an\\nadoption information registry birth parent registration consent form,\\nstating whether or not such biological parent or parents whose consent\\nis subject to the provisions of this section, consents to the receipt of\\nidentifying information by the child to be adopted, upon registration\\nwith the adoption information registry established by section forty-one\\nhundred thirty-eight-c of the public health law and upon the adoptee\\nreaching the age of eighteen. If such consent is made, it shall be\\nrevocable by either of the biological parents at any time. The\\nrevocation of the consent by one of the parents shall revoke the consent\\nof both parents.  The failure of a biological parent to complete the\\nconsent form shall have no effect on the finality of the consent to\\nadoption. A copy of the form required by this subdivision, shall be\\nforwarded to the state adoption information registry for inclusion in\\nthe records maintained by such registry. Any fees authorized to be\\ncharged by the state adoption registry for filing documentation with\\nsuch registry shall be waived for the form required by this subdivision.\\nNo such agency shall draw or receive money from public funds for the\\nsupport of any such child except upon the written order or permit of the\\nlocal social services official of the county or city sought to be\\ncharged with the support of such child.\\n  (b) If a surrender instrument designates a particular person or\\npersons who will adopt a child, such person or persons, the child's\\nbirth parent or parents, the authorized agency having care and custody\\nof the child and the child's attorney, may enter into a written\\nagreement providing for communication or contact between the child and\\nthe child's parent or parents on such terms and conditions as may be\\nagreed to by the parties.\\n  If a surrender instrument does not designate a particular person or\\npersons who will adopt the child, then the child's birth parent or\\nparents, the authorized agency having care and custody of the child and\\nthe child's attorney may enter into a written agreement providing for\\ncommunication or contact, on such terms and conditions as may be agreed\\nto by the parties. Such agreement also may provide terms and conditions\\nfor communication with or contact between the child and the child's\\nbiological sibling or half-sibling, if any. If any such sibling or\\nhalf-sibling is fourteen years of age or older, such terms and\\nconditions shall not be enforceable unless such sibling or half-sibling\\nconsents to the agreement in writing. If the court before which the\\nsurrender instrument is presented for approval determines that the\\nagreement concerning communication and contact is in the child's best\\ninterests, the court shall approve the agreement. If the court does not\\napprove the agreement, the court may nonetheless approve the surrender;\\nprovided, however, that the birth parent or parents executing the\\nsurrender instrument shall be given the opportunity at that time to\\nwithdraw such instrument. Enforcement of any agreement prior to the\\nadoption of the child shall be in accordance with subdivision (b) of\\nsection one thousand fifty-five-a of the family court act. Subsequent to\\nthe adoption of the child, enforcement of any agreement shall be in\\naccordance with section one hundred twelve-b of the domestic relations\\nlaw.\\n  3. Instrument. The instrument herein provided shall be executed and\\nacknowledged (a) before any judge or surrogate in this state having\\njurisdiction over adoption proceedings, except that if the child is\\nbeing surrendered as a result of, or in connection with, a proceeding\\nbefore the family court pursuant to article ten or ten-A of the family\\ncourt act, the instrument shall be executed and acknowledged in the\\nfamily court that exercised jurisdiction over such proceeding and shall\\nbe assigned, wherever practicable, to the judge who last presided over\\nsuch proceeding; or (b) in the presence of one or more witnesses and\\nacknowledged by such witness or witnesses, in the latter case before a\\nnotary public or other officer authorized to take proof of deeds, and\\nshall be recorded in the office of the county clerk in the county where\\nsuch instrument is executed, or where the principal office of such\\nauthorized agency is located, in a book which such county clerk shall\\nprovide and shall keep under seal. Such record shall be subject to\\ninspection and examination only as provided in subdivisions three and\\nfour of section three hundred seventy-two of this title. Notwithstanding\\nany other provision of law, if the parent surrendering the child for\\nadoption is in foster care the instrument shall be executed before a\\njudge of the family court.\\n  Whenever the term surrender or surrender instrument is used in any law\\nrelating to the adoption of children who are not in foster care, it\\nshall mean and refer exclusively to the instrument hereinabove described\\nfor the commitment of the guardianship of the person and the custody of\\na child to an authorized agency by his parents, parent or guardian; and\\nin no case shall it be deemed to apply to any instrument purporting to\\ncommit the guardianship of the person and the custody of a child to any\\nperson other than an authorized agency, nor shall such term or the\\nprovisions of this section be deemed to apply to any instrument\\ntransferring the care and custody of a child to an authorized agency\\npursuant to section three hundred eighty-four-a of this chapter.\\n  Any person or persons having custody of a child for the purpose of\\nadoption through an authorized agency shall be permitted as a matter of\\nright, as an interested party, to intervene in any proceeding commenced\\nto set aside a surrender purporting to commit a guardianship of the\\nperson or custody of a child executed under the provisions of this\\nsection. Such intervention may be made anonymously or in the true name\\nof said person.\\n  Any person or persons having custody for more than twelve months\\nthrough an authorized agency for the purpose of foster care shall be\\npermitted as a matter of right, as an interested party, to intervene in\\nany proceeding commenced to set aside a surrender purporting to commit\\nthe guardianship of the person and custody of a child executed under the\\nprovisions of this section. Such intervention may be made anonymously or\\nin the true name of said person or persons having custody of the child\\nfor the purpose of foster care.\\n  A copy of such surrender shall be given to such surrendering parent\\nupon the execution thereof. The surrender shall include the following\\nstatement: \"I, (name of surrendering parent), this ___ day of\\n__________, _____, have received a copy of this surrender. (Signature of\\nsurrendering parent)\". Such surrendering parent shall so acknowledge the\\ndelivery and the date of the delivery in writing on the surrender.\\n  Where the parties have agreed that the surrender shall be subject to\\nconditions pursuant to subdivision two of this section, the instrument\\nshall further state in plain language that:\\n  (i) the authorized agency shall notify the parent, unless such notice\\nis expressly waived by a statement written by the parent and appended to\\nor included in such instrument, the attorney for the child and the court\\nthat approved the surrender within twenty days of any substantial\\nfailure of a material condition of the surrender prior to the\\nfinalization of the adoption of the child; and\\n  (ii) except for good cause shown, the authorized agency shall file a\\npetition on notice to the parent unless notice is expressly waived by a\\nstatement written by the parent and appended to or included in such\\ninstrument and the child's attorney in accordance with section one\\nthousand fifty-five-a of the family court act within thirty days of such\\nfailure, in order for the court to review such failure and, where\\nnecessary, to hold a hearing; provided, however, that, in the absence of\\nsuch filing, the parent and/or attorney for the child may file such a\\npetition at any time up to sixty days after notification of such\\nfailure. Such petition filed by a parent or attorney for the child must\\nbe filed prior to the child's adoption; and\\n  (iii) the parent is obligated to provide the authorized agency with a\\ndesignated mailing address, as well as any subsequent changes in such\\naddress, at which the parent may receive notices regarding any\\nsubstantial failure of a material condition, unless such notification is\\nexpressly waived by a statement written by the parent and appended to or\\nincluded in such instrument.\\n  Nothing in this paragraph shall limit the notice on the instrument\\nwith respect to a failure to comply with a material condition of a\\nsurrender subsequent to the finalization of the adoption of the child.\\n  4. Upon petition by an authorized agency, a judge of the family court,\\nor a surrogate, may approve such surrender, on such notice to such\\npersons as the surrogate or judge may in his or her discretion\\nprescribe. If the child is being surrendered as a result of, or in\\nconnection with, a proceeding before the family court pursuant to\\narticle ten or ten-A of the family court act, the petition shall be\\nfiled in the family court that exercised jurisdiction over such\\nproceeding and shall be assigned, wherever practicable, to the judge who\\nlast presided over such proceeding. The petition shall set forth the\\nnames and last known addresses of all persons required to be given\\nnotice of the proceeding, pursuant to section three hundred\\neighty-four-c of this title, and there shall be shown by the petition or\\nby affidavit or other proof satisfactory to the court that there are no\\npersons other than those set forth in the petition who are entitled to\\nnotice pursuant to such section. No person who has received such notice\\nand been afforded an opportunity to be heard may challenge the validity\\nof a surrender approved pursuant to this subdivision in any other\\nproceeding. However, this subdivision shall not be deemed to require\\napproval of a surrender by a surrogate or judge for such surrender to be\\nvalid.\\n  5. If a duly executed and acknowledged adoption surrender shall so\\nrecite, no action or proceeding may be maintained by the surrendering\\nparent or guardian for the custody of the surrendered child or to revoke\\nor annul such surrender where the child has been placed in the home of\\nadoptive parents and more than thirty days have elapsed since the\\nexecution of the surrender or where the purpose of such action or\\nproceeding is to return the child to or vest the child's custody in any\\nperson other than the parent or guardian who originally executed such\\nsurrender. This subdivision shall not bar actions or proceedings brought\\non the ground of fraud, duress or coercion in the execution or\\ninducement of a surrender.\\n  For the purposes of this subdivision, no child shall be deemed to have\\nbeen placed in the home of adoptive parents unless the fact of such\\nplacement, the date thereof, the date of the agreement pertaining\\nthereto and the names and addresses of the adoptive parents shall have\\nbeen recorded in a bound volume maintained by the agency for the purpose\\nof recording such information in chronological order.\\n  Where the parties have agreed that the surrender shall be subject to\\nconditions pursuant to subdivision two of this section and where there\\nhas been a substantial failure of a material condition prior to the\\nfinalization of the adoption of the child, the agency shall notify the\\nparent thereof, unless such notice is expressly waived by a statement\\nwritten by the parent and appended to or included in such instrument,\\nand shall notify the court and the law guardian for the child within\\ntwenty days of such failure. In any such case, the authorized agency\\nshall file a petition on notice to the parent unless notice is expressly\\nwaived by a statement written by the parent and appended to or included\\nin such instrument and law guardian in accordance with section one\\nthousand fifty-five-a of the family court act within thirty days of such\\nfailure, except for good cause shown, in order for the court to review\\nsuch failure and, where necessary, to hold a hearing; provided, however,\\nthat, in the absence of such a filing, the parent and/or law guardian\\nfor the child may file such a petition at any time up to sixty days\\nafter notification of the failure. Such a petition filed by a parent or\\nlaw guardian must be filed prior to the adoption. Nothing in this\\nparagraph shall limit the rights and remedies available to the parties\\nand the law guardian pursuant to section one hundred twelve-b of the\\ndomestic relations law with respect to a failure to comply with a\\nmaterial condition of a surrender subsequent to the finalization of the\\nadoption of a child.\\n  6. In an action or proceeding to determine the custody of a child not\\nin foster care surrendered for adoption and placed in an adoptive home\\nor to revoke or annul a surrender instrument in the case of such child\\nplaced in an adoptive home, the parent or parents who surrendered such\\nchild shall have no right to the custody of such child superior to that\\nof the adoptive parents, notwithstanding that the parent or parents who\\nsurrendered the child are fit, competent and able to duly maintain,\\nsupport and educate the child. The custody of such child shall be\\nawarded solely on the basis of the best interests of the child, and\\nthere shall be no presumption that such interests will be promoted by\\nany particular custodial disposition.\\n  7. Upon acceptance of a judicial surrender or approval of an\\nextra-judicial surrender pursuant to this section, the court shall\\nschedule an initial freed child permanency hearing pursuant to section\\none thousand eighty-nine of the family court act.\\n  8. Upon execution of a surrender instrument, the parent executing the\\nsurrender shall provide information to the extent known regarding the\\nother parent, any person to whom the surrendering parent had been\\nmarried at the time of the conception or birth of the child and any\\nother person who would be entitled to notice of a proceeding to\\nterminate parental rights pursuant to section three hundred\\neighty-four-c of this title.

The care\\nand custody of a child may be transferred by a parent or guardian, and\\nthe care of a child may be transferred by any person to whom a parent\\nhas entrusted the care of the child, to an authorized agency by a\\nwritten instrument in accordance with the provisions of this section.\\nSuch transfer by a person who is not the child's parent or guardian\\nshall not affect the rights or obligations of the parents or guardian,\\nand such transfer shall be deemed a transfer of the care and custody of\\nthe child for the purposes of section three hundred fifty-eight-a of\\nthis chapter.\\n  1-a. Prior to accepting a transfer of care and custody, a local social\\nservices official shall commence a search to locate any non-respondent\\nparent of the child and shall conduct an immediate investigation to (a)\\nlocate relatives of the child, including all of the child's\\ngrandparents, all suitable relatives identified by either and any\\nrelative identified by a child over the age of five as a relative who\\nplays or has played a significant positive role in his or her life, and\\nto inform them of the opportunity for becoming foster parents or for\\nseeking custody or care of the child, and that the child may be adopted\\nby foster parents if attempts at reunification with the birth parent are\\nnot required or are unsuccessful; and to determine whether the child may\\nappropriately be placed with a suitable person related to the child and\\nwhether such relative seeks approval as a foster parent pursuant to this\\nchapter for the purposes of providing care for such child, or wishes to\\nprovide care and custody for the child until the parent or other person\\nresponsible for the care of the child is able to resume custody; and (b)\\nidentify minor siblings or half-siblings of the child and to determine\\nwhether such siblings or half-siblings have been or are being\\ntransferred to the care and custody of such official. Such official\\nshall provide or arrange for the provision of care so as to permit the\\nchild and his or her minor siblings or half-siblings to be placed\\ntogether unless, in the judgment of such official, such placement would\\nbe contrary to the best interests of the children; whereupon, such\\nofficial shall provide or arrange for regular visitation and other forms\\nof regular communication between such children unless, in the judgment\\nof such official, such visitation and communication would be contrary to\\nthe best interests of such children. Placement or regular visitation and\\ncommunication with siblings or half-siblings shall be presumptively in\\nthe child's best interests unless such placement or visitation and\\ncommunication would be contrary to the child's health, safety or\\nwelfare, or the lack of geographic proximity precludes or prevents\\nvisitation.\\n  1-b. Upon accepting the transfer of care and custody of a child from\\nthe parent, guardian or other person to whom care of the child has been\\nentrusted, a local social services official shall obtain information to\\nthe extent known from such person regarding the other parent, any person\\nto whom the parent transferring care and custody had been married at the\\ntime of the conception or birth of the child and any other person who\\nwould be entitled to notice of a proceeding to terminate parental rights\\npursuant to section three hundred eighty-four-c of this title. Such\\ninformation shall include, but not be limited to, such parent's or\\nperson's name, last-known address, social security number, employer's\\naddress and any other identifying information. Any information provided\\npursuant to this subdivision shall be recorded in the uniform case\\nrecord maintained pursuant to section four hundred nine-f of this\\narticle; provided, however, that the failure to provide such information\\nshall not invalidate the transfer of care and custody.\\n  2. Terms. (a) The instrument shall be upon such terms, for such time\\nand subject to such conditions as may be agreed upon by the parties\\nthereto.  The office of children and family services may promulgate\\nsuggested terms and conditions for inclusion in such instruments, but\\nshall not require that any particular terms and conditions be included.\\nIf the instrument provides that the child is to be returned by the\\nauthorized agency on a date certain or upon the occurrence of an\\nidentifiable event, such agency shall return such child at such time\\nunless such action would be contrary to court order entered at any time\\nprior to such date or event or within ten days thereafter pursuant to\\nsection three hundred eighty-four-b of this title or article six, ten,\\nor ten-A of the family court act or unless and so long as the parent or\\nguardian is unavailable or incapacitated to receive the child. The\\nparent or guardian may, upon written notice to such agency, request\\nreturn of the child at any time prior to the identified date or event,\\nwhereupon such agency may, without court order, return the child or,\\nwithin ten days after such request, may notify the parent or guardian\\nthat such request is denied. If such agency denies or fails to act upon\\nsuch request, the parent or guardian may seek return of the care and\\ncustody of the child by motion in family court for return of such child\\nand order to show cause, or by writ of habeas corpus in the supreme\\ncourt or family court.  If the instrument fails to specify a date or\\nidentifiable event upon which such agency shall return such child, such\\nagency shall return the child within twenty days after having received\\nnotice that the parent or guardian wishes the child returned, unless\\nsuch action would be contrary to court order entered at any time prior\\nto the expiration of such twenty day period pursuant to section three\\nhundred eighty-four-b of this title or article six, ten, or ten-A of the\\nfamily court act.  Expenditures by a local social services district for\\nthe care and maintenance of a child who has been continued in the care\\nof an authorized agency in violation of the provisions of this\\nsubdivision shall not be subject to state reimbursement.\\n  (b) No provisions set forth in any such instrument regarding the right\\nof the parent or guardian to visit the child or to have services\\nprovided to the child and to the parent or guardian to strengthen the\\nparental relationship may be terminated or limited by the authorized\\nagency having the care and custody of the child unless: (i) the\\ninstrument shall have been amended to so limit or terminate such right,\\npursuant to subdivision three of this section; or (ii) the right of\\nvisitation or to such services would be contrary to or inconsistent with\\na court order obtained in any proceeding in which the parent or guardian\\nwas a party.\\n  (c) The instrument shall state, in lay terms, in conspicuous print of\\nat least eighteen point type:\\n  (i) that the parent or guardian has the right, prior to signing the\\ninstrument transferring the care and custody of the child to an\\nauthorized agency, to legal representation of the parent's own choosing.\\nThe agency shall provide the parent or guardian with a list of attorneys\\nor legal services organizations, if any, which provide free legal\\nservices to persons unable to otherwise obtain such services;\\n  (ii) that the parent or guardian has no legal obligation to transfer\\nthe care and custody of the child to such official, and will incur no\\nlegal sanction for failing to do so;\\n  (iii) that the law permits the instrument to specify a date certain or\\nan identifiable event upon which the child is to be returned, and if no\\ndate or event is specified, that the parent or guardian has a right to\\nthe return of the child within twenty days of a request for return,\\nunless otherwise ordered by the court; and to otherwise have the child\\nreturned in accordance with the terms of the instrument and the\\nprovisions of this section;\\n  (iv) that the parent or guardian has a right to supportive services,\\nwhich shall include preventive and other supportive services authorized\\nto be provided pursuant to the state's consolidated services plan, to\\nvisit the child, and to determine jointly with the agency the terms and\\nfrequency of visitation;\\n  (v) that the parent or guardian, subject to the terms of the\\ninstrument, has an obligation\\n  (A) to visit the child,\\n  (B) to plan for the future of the child,\\n  (C) to meet with and consult with the agency about such plan,\\n  (D) to contribute to the support of the child to the extent of his or\\nher financial ability to do so, and\\n  (E) to inform the agency of any change of name and address;\\n  (vi) that the failure of the parent or guardian to meet the\\nobligations listed in subparagraph (v) could be the basis for a court\\nproceeding for the commitment of the guardianship and custody of the\\nchild to an authorized agency thereby terminating parental rights;\\n  (vii) that the parent or guardian has a right to a fair hearing\\npursuant to section twenty-two of this chapter concerning the agency's\\nfailure to permit the parent or guardian to visit the child or to\\nprovide supportive services, which shall include preventive and other\\nsupportive services authorized to be provided pursuant to the state's\\nconsolidated services plan, to the child and to the parent or guardian;\\n  (viii) the amount of money which the parent will periodically\\ncontribute to the support of the child and the schedule for such\\npayments, if known.\\n  (ix) that if the child remains in foster care for fifteen of the most\\nrecent twenty-two months, the agency may be required by law to file a\\npetition to terminate parental rights.\\n  (d) In any case where a parent who has transferred care and custody of\\na child to a social services official pursuant to this section informs\\nthe social services official that an order or judgment conferring\\nvisitation rights relating to the child has been entered by the family\\ncourt or supreme court or that a written agreement as described in\\nsection two hundred thirty-six of the domestic relations law between the\\nparents confers such rights, any instrument executed pursuant to this\\nsection shall incorporate the provisions of such order, judgment or\\nagreement to the extent that visitation rights are affected and shall\\nprovide for visitation or other rights as required by such order,\\njudgment or agreement. Such incorporation shall not preclude a social\\nservices official from exercising his authority pursuant to paragraph\\n(e) or (f) of this subdivision.\\n  (e) Where a social services official opposes incorporation of an\\norder, judgment or agreement described in paragraph (d) of this\\nsubdivision, such official may, upon execution of the instrument\\ndescribed in this section and upon notice to the non-custodial parent or\\ngrandparent named in such order, judgment or agreement, be heard thereon\\nin a proceeding pursuant to section three hundred fifty-eight-a of this\\nchapter.\\n  (f) Nothing in this section shall be deemed to prohibit a social\\nservices official or an attorney for the child, if any, from making an\\napplication to modify the terms of a visitation order, incorporated\\npursuant to this section, for good cause shown, upon notice to all\\ninterested parties, or to limit the right of a non-custodial parent or\\ngrandparent to seek visitation pursuant to applicable provisions of law.\\n  (g) In the event a child whose care and custody is transferred\\npursuant to this section is admitted to a hospital operated or licensed\\nby the office of mental health and cannot be returned to the physical\\ncustody of his or her parent or guardian upon request because, pursuant\\nto section four hundred of this chapter, the medical director of the\\nfacility has not authorized the removal of the child, the child shall\\nnonetheless be deemed to have been returned to the legal care and\\ncustody of his or her parent or guardian. Expenditures by a social\\nservices district for the care and maintenance of such a child shall be\\nsubject to state reimbursement notwithstanding the provisions of section\\none hundred fifty-three-b of this chapter.\\n  (h) (i) Where a local social services official determines that a child\\nis at significant risk of placement in the care and custody of the local\\ncommissioner of social services during the eighteen months immediately\\nfollowing review by such official because the custodial parent or legal\\nguardian of such child is suffering from a progressively chronic or\\nirreversibly fatal illness and it is determined that there is neither a\\nrelative nor a close friend identified by the custodial parent or the\\nlegal guardian able to assume legal guardianship of the child, the\\ncustodial parent or legal guardian shall be assisted by the local social\\nservices district in transferring the care and custody of the child to\\nan authorized agency by a written instrument in accordance with the\\nprovisions for this section which provides the transfer shall not take\\neffect until the parent or legal guardian dies, becomes debilitated or\\nincapacitated as defined in subdivision one of section seventeen hundred\\ntwenty-six of the surrogate's court procedure act.\\n  (ii) Where a local social services official determines that a child is\\nat significant risk of placement in the care and custody of the local\\ncommissioner of social services during the eighteen months immediately\\nfollowing a review of such official because the custodial parent or\\nlegal guardian is suffering from a progressively chronic or irreversibly\\nfatal illness and there is a relative or close friend identified by the\\ncustodial parent or legal guardian who is able and willing to assume\\ncare and custody of the child, but who requires foster care services and\\nfinancial support thereof pursuant to section three hundred\\nninety-eight-a of this article, the custodial parent or legal guardian\\nshall be assisted by the local social services district in transferring\\nthe care and custody of the child to an authorized agency by a written\\ninstrument in accordance with the provisions of this section. Such\\ninstrument shall provide that the transfer of custody shall not take\\neffect until the parent or legal guardian dies, becomes debilitated or\\nincapacitated as defined in subdivision one of section seventeen hundred\\ntwenty-six of the surrogate's court procedure act. If otherwise\\nqualified, the social services official shall assist the person\\nidentified to accept care and custody of the child to become certified\\nas a foster parent.\\n  (iii) A local social services official who accepts or proposes to\\naccept the care and custody of a child by means of a written instrument\\nexecuted pursuant to this paragraph, shall, pursuant to section three\\nhundred fifty-eight-a of this chapter, petition the family court of the\\ncounty or city in which the local social services official has his or\\nher office to approve such written instrument. A written instrument\\nexecuted pursuant to this paragraph and approved pursuant to section\\nthree hundred fifty-eight-a of this chapter shall be in effect until the\\ncourt reviews the child's placement pursuant to article ten-A of the\\nfamily court act. The status of a child subject to such an instrument\\nshall be reviewed by the court pursuant to article ten-A of the family\\ncourt act.\\n  (iv) Upon receiving a notice from the custodial parent or the legal\\nguardian that the parent or legal guardian is no longer debilitated or\\nincapacitated and that the parent or legal guardian requests the\\nimmediate return of the child, the social services district shall return\\nsuch child to the parent or legal guardian within ten days of receiving\\nnotice, except where a contrary court order has been issued pursuant to\\npart two, five or seven of article ten of the family court act.\\n  3.

Guardianship and custody of destitute or dependent children;\\ncommitment by court order; modification of commitment and restoration of\\nparental rights.\\n  1. Statement of legislative findings and intent.\\n  (a) The legislature recognizes that the health and safety of children\\nis of paramount importance. To the extent it is consistent with the\\nhealth and safety of the child, the legislature further hereby finds\\nthat:\\n  (i) it is desirable for children to grow up with a normal family life\\nin a permanent home and that such circumstance offers the best\\nopportunity for children to develop and thrive;\\n  (ii) it is generally desirable for the child to remain with or be\\nreturned to the birth parent because the child's need for a normal\\nfamily life will usually best be met in the home of its birth parent,\\nand that parents are entitled to bring up their own children unless the\\nbest interests of the child would be thereby endangered;\\n  (iii) the state's first obligation is to help the family with services\\nto prevent its break-up or to reunite it if the child has already left\\nhome; and\\n  (iv) when it is clear that the birth parent cannot or will not provide\\na normal family home for the child and when continued foster care is not\\nan appropriate plan for the child, then a permanent alternative home\\nshould be sought for the child.\\n  (b) The legislature further finds that many children who have been\\nplaced in foster care experience unnecessarily protracted stays in such\\ncare without being adopted or returned to their parents or other\\ncustodians. Such unnecessary stays may deprive these children of\\npositive, nurturing family relationships and have deleterious effects on\\ntheir development into responsible, productive citizens. The legislature\\nfurther finds that provision of a timely procedure for the termination,\\nin appropriate cases, of the rights of the birth parents could reduce\\nsuch unnecessary stays.\\n  It is the intent of the legislature in enacting this section to\\nprovide procedures not only assuring that the rights of the birth parent\\nare protected, but also, where positive, nurturing parent-child\\nrelationships no longer exist, furthering the best interests, needs, and\\nrights of the child by terminating parental rights and freeing the child\\nfor adoption.\\n  2. For the purposes of this section, (a) \"child\" shall mean a person\\nunder the age of eighteen years; and, (b) \"parent\" shall include an\\nincarcerated parent unless otherwise qualified.\\n  3. (a) The guardianship of the person and the custody of a destitute\\nor dependent child may be committed to an authorized agency, or to a\\nfoster parent authorized pursuant to section one thousand eighty-nine of\\nthe family court act to institute a proceeding under this section, or to\\na relative with care and custody of the child, by order of a surrogate\\nor judge of the family court, as hereinafter provided. Where such\\nguardianship and custody is committed to a foster parent or to a\\nrelative with care and custody of the child, the family court or\\nsurrogate's court shall retain continuing jurisdiction over the parties\\nand the child and may, upon its own motion or the motion of any party,\\nrevoke, modify or extend its order, if the foster parent or relative\\nfails to institute a proceeding for the adoption of the child within six\\nmonths after the entry of the order committing the guardianship and\\ncustody of the child to such foster parent or relative. Where the foster\\nparent or relative institutes a proceeding for the adoption of the child\\nand the adoption petition is finally denied or dismissed, the court\\nwhich committed the guardianship and custody of the child to the foster\\nparent or relative shall revoke the order of commitment. Where the court\\nrevokes an order committing the guardianship and custody of a child to a\\nfoster parent or relative, it shall commit the guardianship and custody\\nof the child to an authorized agency.\\n  (b) A proceeding under this section may be originated by an authorized\\nagency or by a foster parent authorized to do so pursuant to section one\\nthousand eighty-nine of the family court act or by a relative with care\\nand custody of the child or, if an authorized agency ordered by the\\ncourt to originate a proceeding under this section fails to do so within\\nthe time fixed by the court, by the child's attorney or guardian ad\\nlitem on the court's direction.\\n  (c) Where a child was placed or continued in foster care pursuant to\\narticle ten, ten-A or ten-C of the family court act or section three\\nhundred fifty-eight-a of this chapter, a proceeding under this section\\nshall be originated in the family court in the county in which the\\nproceeding pursuant to article ten, ten-A or ten-C of the family court\\nact or section three hundred fifty-eight-a of this chapter was last\\nheard and shall be assigned, wherever practicable, to the judge who last\\nheard such proceeding. Where multiple proceedings are commenced under\\nthis section concerning a child and one or more siblings or\\nhalf-siblings of such child, placed or continued in foster care with the\\nsame commissioner pursuant to section one thousand fifty-five, one\\nthousand eighty-nine or one thousand ninety-five of the family court\\nact, all of such proceedings may be commenced jointly in the family\\ncourt in any county which last heard a proceeding under article ten,\\nten-A or ten-C of the family court act regarding any of the children who\\nare the subjects of the proceedings under this section. In such\\ninstances, the case shall be assigned, wherever practicable, to the\\njudge who last presided over such proceeding. In any other case, a\\nproceeding under this section, including a proceeding brought in the\\nsurrogate's court, shall be originated in the county where either of the\\nparents of the child reside at the time of the filing of the petition,\\nif known, or, if such residence is not known, in the county in which the\\nauthorized agency has an office for the regular conduct of business or\\nin which the child resides at the time of the initiation of the\\nproceeding. To the extent possible, the court shall, when appointing an\\nattorney for the child, appoint an attorney who has previously\\nrepresented the child.\\n  (c-1) Before hearing a petition under this section, the court in which\\nthe termination of parental rights petition has been filed shall\\nascertain whether the child is under the jurisdiction of a family court\\npursuant to a placement in a child protective or foster care proceeding\\nor continuation in out-of-home care pursuant to a permanency hearing\\nand, if so, which court exercised jurisdiction over the most recent\\nproceeding. If the court determines that the child is under the\\njurisdiction of a different family court, the court in which the\\ntermination of parental rights petition was filed shall stay its\\nproceeding for not more than thirty days and shall communicate with the\\ncourt that exercised jurisdiction over the most recent proceeding. The\\ncommunication shall be recorded or summarized on the record by the court\\nin which the termination of parental rights petition was filed. Both\\ncourts shall notify the parties and child's attorney, if any, in their\\nrespective proceedings and shall give them an opportunity to present\\nfacts and legal argument or to participate in the communication prior to\\nthe issuance of a decision on jurisdiction. The court that exercised\\njurisdiction over the most recent proceeding shall determine whether it\\nwill accept or decline jurisdiction over the termination of parental\\nrights petition. This determination of jurisdiction shall be\\nincorporated into an order regarding jurisdiction that shall be issued\\nby the court in which the termination of parental rights petition was\\nfiled within thirty days of such filing. If the court that exercised\\njurisdiction over the most recent proceeding determines that it should\\nexercise jurisdiction over the termination of parental rights petition,\\nthe order shall require that the petition shall be transferred to that\\ncourt forthwith but in no event more than thirty-five days after the\\nfiling of the petition. The petition shall be assigned, wherever\\npracticable, to the judge who heard the most recent proceeding. If the\\ncourt that exercised jurisdiction over the most recent proceeding\\ndeclines to exercise jurisdiction over the adoption petition, the court\\nin which the termination of parental rights petition was filed shall\\nissue an order incorporating that determination and shall proceed\\nforthwith.\\n  (d) The family court shall have exclusive, original jurisdiction over\\nany proceeding brought upon grounds specified in paragraph (c), (d) or\\n(e) of subdivision four of this section, and the family court and\\nsurrogate's court shall have concurrent, original jurisdiction over any\\nproceeding brought upon grounds specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of\\nsubdivision four of this section, except as provided in paragraphs (c)\\nand (c-1) of this subdivision.\\n  (e) A proceeding under this section is originated by a petition on\\nnotice served upon the child's parent or parents, the attorney for the\\nchild's parent or parents and upon such other persons as the court may\\nin its discretion prescribe. Such notice shall inform the parents and\\nsuch other persons that the proceeding may result in an order freeing\\nthe child for adoption without the consent of or notice to the parents\\nor such other persons. Such notice also shall inform the parents and\\nsuch other persons of their right to the assistance of counsel,\\nincluding any right they may have to have counsel assigned by the court\\nin any case where they are financially unable to obtain counsel. The\\npetition shall set forth the names and last known addresses of all\\npersons required to be given notice of the proceeding, pursuant to this\\nsection and section three hundred eighty-four-c of this title, and there\\nshall be shown by the petition or by affidavit or other proof\\nsatisfactory to the court that there are no persons other than those set\\nforth in the petition who are entitled to notice pursuant to the\\nprovisions of this section or of section three hundred eighty-four-c of\\nthis title. When the proceeding is initiated in family court service of\\nthe petition and other process shall be made in accordance with the\\nprovisions of section six hundred seventeen of the family court act, and\\nwhen the proceeding is initiated in surrogate's court, service shall be\\nmade in accordance with the provisions of section three hundred seven of\\nthe surrogate's court procedure act. When the proceeding is initiated on\\nthe grounds of abandonment of a child less than one year of age at the\\ntime of the transfer of the care and custody of such child to a local\\nsocial services official, the court shall take judicial notice of\\nefforts to locate the child's parents or other known relatives or other\\npersons legally responsible pursuant to paragraph (ii) of subdivision\\n(b) of section one thousand fifty-five of the family court act.\\n  (f) In any proceeding under this section in which the surrogate's\\ncourt has exercised jurisdiction, the provisions of the surrogate's\\ncourt procedure act shall apply to the extent that they do not conflict\\nwith the specific provisions of this section. In any proceeding under\\nthis section in which the family court has exercised jurisdiction, the\\nprovisions of articles one, two and eleven of the family court act shall\\napply to the extent that they do not conflict with the specific\\nprovisions of this section. In any proceeding under this section, the\\nprovisions and limitations of article thirty-one of the civil practice\\nlaw and rules shall apply to the extent that they do not conflict with\\nthe specific provisions of this section. In determining any motion for a\\nprotective order, the court shall consider the need of the party for the\\ndiscovery to assist in the preparation of the case and any potential\\nharm to the child from the discovery. The court shall set a schedule for\\ndiscovery to avoid unnecessary delay.

In the event of\\nsuch filing the social services official or authorized agency having\\ncare and custody of the child shall be served with notice of the\\nproceeding and shall join the petition.\\n  (v) For the purposes of clause (D) of subparagraph (i) of this\\nparagraph, an assessment of whether a parent maintains a meaningful role\\nin his or her child's life shall be based on evidence, which may include\\nthe following: a parent's expressions or acts manifesting concern for\\nthe child, such as letters, telephone calls, visits, and other forms of\\ncommunication with the child; efforts by the parent to communicate and\\nwork with the authorized agency, attorney for the child, foster parent,\\nthe court, and the parent's attorney or other individuals providing\\nservices to the parent, including correctional, mental health and\\nsubstance abuse treatment program personnel for the purpose of complying\\nwith the service plan and repairing, maintaining or building the\\nparent-child relationship; a positive response by the parent to the\\nauthorized agency's diligent efforts as defined in paragraph (f) of\\nsubdivision seven of this section; and whether the continued involvement\\nof the parent in the child's life is in the child's best interest.

(a) For the purposes of this section, a child is \"abandoned\" by his\\nparent if such parent evinces an intent to forego his or her parental\\nrights and obligations as manifested by his or her failure to visit the\\nchild and communicate with the child or agency, although able to do so\\nand not prevented or discouraged from doing so by the agency. In the\\nabsence of evidence to the contrary, such ability to visit and\\ncommunicate shall be presumed.\\n  (b) The subjective intent of the parent, whether expressed or\\notherwise, unsupported by evidence of the foregoing parental acts\\nmanifesting such intent, shall not preclude a determination that such\\nparent has abandoned his or her child. In making such determination, the\\ncourt shall not require a showing of diligent efforts, if any, by an\\nauthorized agency to encourage the parent to perform the acts specified\\nin paragraph (a) of this subdivision.\\n  6. (a) For the purposes of this section, \"mental illness\" means an\\naffliction with a mental disease or mental condition which is manifested\\nby a disorder or disturbance in behavior, feeling, thinking or judgment\\nto such an extent that if such child were placed in or returned to the\\ncustody of the parent, the child would be in danger of becoming a\\nneglected child as defined in the family court act.\\n  (b) For the purposes of this section, \"intellectual disability\" means\\nsubaverage intellectual functioning which originates during the\\ndevelopmental period and is associated with impairment in adaptive\\nbehavior to such an extent that if such child were placed in or returned\\nto the custody of the parent, the child would be in danger of becoming a\\nneglected child as defined in the family court act; provided, however,\\nthat case law regarding use of the phrase \"mental retardation\" under\\nthis section shall be applicable to the term \"intellectual disability\".\\n  (c) The legal sufficiency of the proof in a proceeding upon the ground\\nset forth in paragraph (c) of subdivision four of this section shall not\\nbe determined until the judge has taken the testimony of a psychologist,\\nor psychiatrist, in accordance with paragraph (e) of this subdivision.\\n  (d) A determination or order upon a ground set forth in paragraph (c)\\nof subdivision four shall in no way affect any other right, or\\nconstitute an adjudication of the legal status of the parent.\\n  (e) In every proceeding upon a ground set forth in paragraph (c) of\\nsubdivision four the judge shall order the parent to be examined by, and\\nshall take the testimony of, a qualified psychiatrist or a psychologist\\nlicensed pursuant to article one hundred fifty-three of the education\\nlaw as defined in section 730.10 of the criminal procedure law in the\\ncase of a parent alleged to be mentally ill or retarded, such\\npsychologist or psychiatrist to be appointed by the court pursuant to\\nsection thirty-five of the judiciary law. The parent and the authorized\\nagency shall have the right to submit other psychiatric, psychological\\nor medical evidence. If the parent refuses to submit to such\\ncourt-ordered examination, or if the parent renders himself unavailable\\ntherefor whether before or after the initiation of a proceeding under\\nthis section, by departing from the state or by concealing himself\\ntherein, the appointed psychologist or psychiatrist, upon the basis of\\nother available information, including, but not limited to, agency,\\nhospital or clinic records, may testify without an examination of such\\nparent, provided that such other information affords a reasonable basis\\nfor his opinion.\\n  7.  (a) For the purposes of this section, \"permanently neglected\\nchild\" shall mean a child who is in the care of an authorized agency and\\nwhose parent or custodian has failed for a period of either at least one\\nyear or fifteen out of the most recent twenty-two months following the\\ndate such child came into the care of an authorized agency substantially\\nand continuously or repeatedly to maintain contact with or plan for the\\nfuture of the child, although physically and financially able to do so,\\nnotwithstanding the agency's diligent efforts to encourage and\\nstrengthen the parental relationship when such efforts will not be\\ndetrimental to the best interests of the child. The court shall consider\\nthe special circumstances of an incarcerated parent or parents, or of a\\nparent or parents participating in a residential substance abuse\\ntreatment program, when determining whether a child is a \"permanently\\nneglected child\" as defined in this paragraph. In such cases, the court\\nalso shall consider the particular constraints, including but not\\nlimited to, limitations placed on family contact and the unavailability\\nof social or rehabilitative services to aid in the development of a\\nmeaningful relationship between the parent and his or her child, that\\nmay impact the parent's ability to substantially and continuously or\\nrepeatedly maintain contact with his or her child and to plan for the\\nfuture of his or her child as defined in paragraph (c) of this\\nsubdivision. Where a court has previously determined in accordance with\\nparagraph (b) of subdivision three of section three hundred\\nfifty-eight-a of this chapter or section one thousand thirty-nine-b,\\nsubparagraph (A) of paragraph (i) of subdivision (b) of section one\\nthousand fifty-two, paragraph (b) of subdivision two of section seven\\nhundred fifty-four or paragraph (c) of subdivision two of section 352.2\\nof the family court act that reasonable efforts to make it possible for\\nthe child to return safely to his or her home are not required, the\\nagency shall not be required to demonstrate diligent efforts as defined\\nin this section. In the event that the parent defaults after due notice\\nof a proceeding to determine such neglect, such physical and financial\\nability of such parent may be presumed by the court.\\n  (b) For the purposes of paragraph (a) of this subdivision, evidence of\\ninsubstantial or infrequent contacts by a parent with his or her child\\nshall not, of itself, be sufficient as a matter of law to preclude a\\ndetermination that such child is a permanently neglected child. A visit\\nor communication by a parent with the child which is of such character\\nas to overtly demonstrate a lack of affectionate and concerned\\nparenthood shall not be deemed a substantial contact.\\n  (c) As used in paragraph (a) of this subdivision, \"to plan for the\\nfuture of the child\" shall mean to take such steps as may be necessary\\nto provide an adequate, stable home and parental care for the child\\nwithin a period of time which is reasonable under the financial\\ncircumstances available to the parent. The plan must be realistic and\\nfeasible, and good faith effort shall not, of itself, be determinative.\\nIn determining whether a parent has planned for the future of the child,\\nthe court may consider the failure of the parent to utilize medical,\\npsychiatric, psychological and other social and rehabilitative services\\nand material resources made available to such parent.\\n  (d) For the purposes of this subdivision:\\n  (i) A parent shall not be deemed unable to maintain contact with or\\nplan for the future of the child by reason of such parent's use of drugs\\nor alcohol, except while the parent is actually hospitalized or\\ninstitutionalized therefor; and\\n  (ii) The time during which a parent is actually hospitalized or\\ninstitutionalized shall not interrupt, but shall not be part of, a\\nperiod of failure to maintain contact with or plan for the future of a\\nchild.\\n  (e) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a) of this\\nsubdivision, evidence of diligent efforts by an agency to encourage and\\nstrengthen the parental relationship shall not be required when:\\n  (i) The parent has failed for a period of six months to keep the\\nagency apprised of his or her location, provided that the court may\\nconsider the particular delays or barriers an incarcerated parent or\\nparents, or a parent or parents participating in a residential substance\\nabuse treatment program, may experience in keeping the agency apprised\\nof his or her location; or\\n  (ii) An incarcerated parent has failed on more than one occasion while\\nincarcerated to cooperate with an authorized agency in its efforts to\\nassist such parent to plan for the future of the child, as such phrase\\nis defined in paragraph (c) of this subdivision, or in such agency's\\nefforts to plan and arrange visits with the child as described in\\nsubparagraph five of paragraph (f) of this subdivision.\\n  (f) As used in this subdivision, \"diligent efforts\" shall mean\\nreasonable attempts by an authorized agency to assist, develop and\\nencourage a meaningful relationship between the parent and child,\\nincluding but not limited to:\\n  (1) consultation and cooperation with the parents in developing a plan\\nfor appropriate services to the child and his family;\\n  (2) making suitable arrangements for the parents to visit the child\\nexcept that with respect to an incarcerated parent, arrangements for the\\nincarcerated parent to visit the child outside the correctional facility\\nshall not be required unless reasonably feasible and in the best\\ninterest of the child;\\n  (3) provision of services and other assistance to the parents, except\\nincarcerated parents, so that problems preventing the discharge of the\\nchild from care may be resolved or ameliorated;\\n  (4) informing the parents at appropriate intervals of the child's\\nprogress, development and health;\\n  (5) making suitable arrangements with a correctional facility and\\nother appropriate persons for an incarcerated parent to visit the child\\nwithin the correctional facility, if such visiting is in the best\\ninterests of the child. When no visitation between child and\\nincarcerated parent has been arranged for or permitted by the authorized\\nagency because such visitation is determined not to be in the best\\ninterest of the child, then no permanent neglect proceeding under this\\nsubdivision shall be initiated on the basis of the lack of such\\nvisitation. Such arrangements shall include, but shall not be limited\\nto, the transportation of the child to the correctional facility, and\\nproviding or suggesting social or rehabilitative services to resolve or\\ncorrect the problems other than incarceration itself which impair the\\nincarcerated parent's ability to maintain contact with the child. When\\nthe parent is incarcerated in a correctional facility located outside\\nthe state, the provisions of this subparagraph shall be construed to\\nrequire that an authorized agency make such arrangements with the\\ncorrectional facility only if reasonably feasible and permissible in\\naccordance with the laws and regulations applicable to such facility;\\nand\\n  (6) providing information which the authorized agency shall obtain\\nfrom the office of children and family services, outlining the legal\\nrights and obligations of a parent who is incarcerated or in a\\nresidential substance abuse treatment program whose child is in custody\\nof an authorized agency, and on social or rehabilitative services\\navailable in the community, including family visiting services, to aid\\nin the development of a meaningful relationship between the parent and\\nchild.  Wherever possible, such information shall include transitional\\nand family support services located in the community to which an\\nincarcerated parent or parent participating in a residential substance\\nabuse treatment program shall return.\\n  8. (a) For the purposes of this section a child is \"severely abused\"\\nby his or her parent if (i) the child has been found to be an abused\\nchild as a result of reckless or intentional acts of the parent\\ncommitted under circumstances evincing a depraved indifference to human\\nlife, which result in serious physical injury to the child as defined in\\nsubdivision ten of section 10.00 of the penal law; or\\n  (ii) the child has been found to be an abused child, as defined in\\nparagraph (iii) of subdivision (e) of section ten hundred twelve of the\\nfamily court act, as a result of such parent's acts; provided, however,\\nthe respondent must have committed or knowingly allowed to be committed\\na felony sex offense as defined in sections 130.25, 130.30, 130.35,\\n130.40, 130.45, 130.50, 130.65, 130.67, 130.70, 130.75, 130.80, 130.95\\nand 130.96 of the penal law and, for the purposes of this section the\\ncorroboration requirements contained in the penal law shall not apply to\\nproceedings under this section; or\\n  (iii) (A) the parent of such child has been convicted of murder in the\\nfirst degree as defined in section 125.27, murder in the second degree\\nas defined in section 125.25, manslaughter in the first degree as\\ndefined in section 125.20, or manslaughter in the second degree as\\ndefined in section 125.15, and the victim of any such crime was another\\nchild of the parent or another child for whose care such parent is or\\nhas been legally responsible as defined in subdivision (g) of section\\none thousand twelve of the family court act, or another parent of the\\nchild, unless the convicted parent was a victim of physical, sexual or\\npsychological abuse by the decedent parent and such abuse was a factor\\nin causing the homicide; or has been convicted of an attempt to commit\\nany of the foregoing crimes, and the victim or intended victim was the\\nchild or another child of the parent or another child for whose care\\nsuch parent is or has been legally responsible as defined in subdivision\\n(g) of section one thousand twelve of the family court act, or another\\nparent of the child, unless the convicted parent was a victim of\\nphysical, sexual or psychological abuse by the decedent parent and such\\nabuse was a factor in causing the attempted homicide; (B) the parent of\\nsuch child has been convicted of criminal solicitation as defined in\\narticle one hundred, conspiracy as defined in article one hundred five\\nor criminal facilitation as defined in article one hundred fifteen of\\nthe penal law for conspiring, soliciting or facilitating any of the\\nforegoing crimes, and the victim or intended victim was the child or\\nanother child of the parent or another child for whose care such parent\\nis or has been legally responsible; (C) the parent of such child has\\nbeen convicted of assault in the second degree as defined in section\\n120.05, assault in the first degree as defined in section 120.10 or\\naggravated assault upon a person less than eleven years old as defined\\nin section 120.12 of the penal law, and the victim of any such crime was\\nthe child or another child of the parent or another child for whose care\\nsuch parent is or has been legally responsible; or has been convicted of\\nan attempt to commit any of the foregoing crimes, and the victim or\\nintended victim was the child or another child of the parent or another\\nchild for whose care such parent is or has been legally responsible; or\\n(D) the parent of such child has been convicted under the law in any\\nother jurisdiction of an offense which includes all of the essential\\nelements of any crime specified in clause (A), (B) or (C) of this\\nsubparagraph; and\\n  (iv) the agency has made diligent efforts to encourage and strengthen\\nthe parental relationship, including efforts to rehabilitate the\\nrespondent, when such efforts will not be detrimental to the best\\ninterests of the child, and such efforts have been unsuccessful and are\\nunlikely to be successful in the foreseeable future.

At least sixty days prior to taking any such\\naction, the commissioner of the office shall provide notice of such\\naction to the speaker of the assembly and the temporary president of the\\nsenate and shall post such notice upon its public website. Such notice\\nmay be provided at any time on or after the date the office approves a\\nplan authorizing a social services district to implement programs for\\njuvenile delinquents placed in the applicable setting level. Such\\ncommissioner shall be authorized to conduct any and all preparatory\\nactions which may be required to effectuate such closures or significant\\nservice or staffing reductions and transfer of operations during such\\nsixty day period. In assessing which of such facilities to close, or at\\nwhich to implement any significant service reductions, public employee\\nstaffing reductions and/or transfer of operations to a private or\\nnot-for-profit entity, the commissioner shall consider the following\\nfactors: (1) ability to provide a safe, humane and therapeutic\\nenvironment for placed youth; (2) ability to meet the educational,\\nmental health, substance abuse and behavioral health treatment needs of\\nplaced youth; (3) community networks and partnerships that promote the\\nsocial, mental, economic and behavioral development of placed youth; (4)\\nfuture capacity requirements for the effective operation of youth\\nfacilities; (5) the physical characteristics, conditions and costs of\\noperation of the facility; and (6) the location of the facility in\\nregards to costs and ease of transportation of placed youth and their\\nfamilies.\\n  (b) Any transfers of capacity or any resulting transfer of functions\\nshall be authorized to be made by the commissioner of the office of\\nchildren and family services and any transfer of personnel upon such\\ntransfer of capacity or transfer of functions shall be accomplished in\\naccordance with the provisions of section seventy of the civil service\\nlaw.\\n  8. (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary,\\neligible expenditures during the applicable time periods made by a\\nsocial services district for an approved juvenile justice services close\\nto home initiative shall, if approved by the department of family\\nassistance, be subject to reimbursement with state funds only up to the\\nextent of an annual appropriation made specifically therefor, after\\nfirst deducting therefrom any federal funds properly received or to be\\nreceived on account thereof; provided, however, that when such funds\\nhave been exhausted, a social services district may receive state\\nreimbursement from other available state appropriations for that state\\nfiscal year for eligible expenditures for services that otherwise would\\nbe reimbursable under such funding streams. Any claims submitted by a\\nsocial services district for reimbursement for a particular state fiscal\\nyear for which the social services district does not receive state\\nreimbursement from the annual appropriation for the approved close to\\nhome initiative may not be claimed against that district's appropriation\\nfor the initiative for the next or any subsequent state fiscal year.\\n  (b) The department of family assistance is authorized, in its\\ndiscretion, to make advances to a social services district in\\nanticipation of the state reimbursement provided for in this section.\\n  (c) A social services district shall conduct eligibility\\ndeterminations for federal and state funding and submit claims for\\nreimbursement in such form and manner and at such times and for such\\nperiods as the department of family assistance shall determine.\\n  (d) Notwithstanding any inconsistent provision of law or regulation of\\nthe department of family assistance, state reimbursement shall not be\\nmade for any expenditure made for the duplication of any grant or\\nallowance for any period.\\n  (e) Claims submitted by a social services district for reimbursement\\nshall be paid after deducting any expenditures defrayed by fees, third\\nparty reimbursement, and any non-tax levy funds including any donated\\nfunds.\\n  (f) The office of children and family services shall not reimburse any\\nclaims for expenditures for residential services that are submitted more\\nthan twenty-two months after the calendar quarter in which the\\nexpenditures were made.\\n  (g) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the state shall not be\\nresponsible for reimbursing a social services district and a district\\nshall not seek state reimbursement for any portion of any state\\ndisallowance or sanction taken against the social services district, or\\nany federal disallowance attributable to final federal agency decisions\\nor to settlements made, when such disallowance or sanction results from\\nthe failure of the social services district to comply with federal or\\nstate requirements, including, but not limited to, failure to document\\neligibility for the federal or state funds in the case record. To the\\nextent that the social services district has sufficient claims other\\nthan those that are subject to disallowance or sanction to draw down the\\nfull annual appropriation, such disallowance or sanction shall not\\nresult in a reduction in payment of state funds to the district unless\\nthe district requests that the department use a portion of the\\nappropriation toward meeting the district's responsibility to repay the\\nfederal government for the disallowance or sanction and any related\\ninterest payments.\\n  (h) Rates for residential services. (i) The office shall establish the\\nrates, in accordance with section three hundred ninety-eight-a of this\\nchapter, for any non-secure facilities established under an approved\\njuvenile justice services close to home initiative. For any such\\nnon-secure facility that will be used primarily by the social services\\ndistrict with an approved close to home initiative, final authority for\\nestablishment of such rates and any adjustments thereto shall reside\\nwith the office, but such rates and any adjustments thereto shall be\\nestablished only upon the request of, and in consultation with, such\\nsocial services district.\\n  (ii) A social services district with an approved juvenile justice\\nservices close to home initiative for juvenile delinquents placed in\\nlimited secure settings shall have the authority to establish and\\nadjust, on an annual or regular basis, maintenance rates for limited\\nsecure facilities providing residential services under such initiative.\\nSuch rates shall not be subject to the provisions of section three\\nhundred ninety-eight-a of this chapter but shall be subject to maximum\\ncost limits established by the office of children and family services.\\n  9. Upon approval of a social services district's plan, the office of\\nchildren and family services shall notify the supervising family court\\njudge responsible for the family courts serving such district of the\\neffective date and placement settings covered by the plan.\\n  (a) Beginning on the effective date of a district's approved plan that\\nonly covers juvenile delinquents placed in non-secure settings, a family\\ncourt judge serving in a county where such social services district is\\nlocated shall only be authorized to place an adjudicated juvenile\\ndelinquent in the custody of the commissioner of the office of children\\nand family services for placement in a secure or limited secure facility\\npursuant to section 353.3 or 353.5 of the family court act.\\n  (b) Beginning on the effective date of a district's approved plan to\\nimplement programs for juvenile delinquents placed in limited secure\\nsettings, a family court judge serving in a county where such social\\nservices district is located shall only be authorized to place an\\nadjudicated juvenile delinquent in the custody of the commissioner of\\nthe office of children and family services for placement in a secure\\nfacility pursuant to section 353.3 or 353.5 of the family court act.\\n  10. If the social services district receives the necessary approval to\\nimplement a close to home initiative, the district shall implement the\\ninitiative in accordance with all applicable federal and state laws and\\nregulations. If the social services district receives the necessary\\napproval of a plan for juvenile delinquents placed in limited secure\\nsettings, the office shall promulgate regulations governing the\\noperation of such limited secure facilities. If such regulations are not\\nadopted prior to the date that an authorized agency applies for a\\nlicense to operate such a facility, the facility shall be subject to the\\nexisting regulations of the office that would apply to the operation of\\na foster care facility of the same size; provided, however, that the\\noffice shall be authorized to grant an exception to the authorized\\nagency, until such limited secure regulations are adopted, to any such\\nexisting regulation that the office determines would impede the ability\\nof the authorized agency to provide the restrictive setting and programs\\nnecessary to serve youth who need placement in a limited secure setting\\nin accordance with the approved plan. Any limited secure facility that\\nis granted such a waiver shall comply with any alternate requirements\\nthe office may consider necessary for the protection of the health or\\nsafety of the juvenile delinquents in the facility or the surrounding\\ncommunity. The office shall take all reasonable steps available to\\nfinalize the adoption of regulations governing the operation of such\\nlimited secure facilities no later than six months after it issues the\\nfirst license for a program to provide services to juvenile delinquents\\nplaced in limited secure settings but in no event shall such regulations\\nbe adopted on an emergency basis.\\n  (a) The initiative shall be subject to the office of children and\\nfamily services' ongoing oversight and monitoring including, but not\\nlimited to: case record reviews; staff, family, and client interviews;\\non-site inspections; review of data regarding provider performance,\\nyouth and staff safety, and quality of care, which must be provided to\\nthe office in order to carry out its responsibilities, in the form and\\nmanner and at such times as required by the office; and continued\\nlicensing and monitoring of the authorized agencies providing services\\nunder the plan pursuant to this chapter.\\n  (b) The social services district shall provide each juvenile\\ndelinquent with an appropriate level of services designed to meet his or\\nher individual needs and to enhance public safety and shall provide the\\noffice of children and family services with specific information as\\nrequired by the office, in the format and at such times as required by\\nsuch office, on the youth participating in the initiative and the\\nprograms serving such youth. Such information shall be provided to the\\noffice of children and family services on a monthly basis for the first\\ntwelve months immediately following the implementation of the programs\\nfor each level of care and shall be provided to such office on a\\nquarterly basis thereafter.\\n  11. The social services district shall submit an annual report to the\\noffice of children and family services, the temporary president of the\\nsenate and the speaker of the assembly, in the format required by such\\noffice, detailing overall initiative performance. Such report shall\\ninclude, but not be limited to:\\n  (a) number of juvenile delinquents placed with the local social\\nservices district;\\n  (b) number of juvenile delinquents placed in a non-secure facility\\nwith the social services district;\\n  (c) number of juvenile delinquents placed in a limited secure facility\\nwith the social services district, as applicable;\\n  (d) demographic information about juvenile delinquents in care;\\n  (e) number of specialized beds in each category of specialized\\nprogram;\\n  (f) number and nature of incident reports;\\n  (g) number of juvenile delinquents absent without leave per facility;\\n  (h) average length of stay;\\n  (i) number of conditionally released juvenile delinquents;\\n  (j) number of discharged juvenile delinquents who are subsequently\\nplaced with the district;\\n  (k) number and nature of corrective action plans and resolutions;\\n  (l) number of juvenile delinquents transferred between facilities,\\nincluding the number of juvenile delinquents transferred between\\nnon-secure and limited-secure facilities, as applicable; and\\n  (m) number of petitions filed to transfer juvenile delinquents between\\nthe custody of the office and the social services district.\\n  12. If the office of children and family services determines that the\\nsocial services district is failing to adequately provide for the\\njuvenile delinquents placed under an approved plan, such office may\\nrequire the social services district to submit a corrective action plan,\\nfor such office's approval, demonstrating how it will rectify the\\ninadequacies in the time specified by the office, but no later than\\nthirty days from such request. If the office determines that the social\\nservices district is failing to make sufficient progress towards\\nimplementing the corrective action plan in the time and manner approved\\nby the office but no later than sixty days from the date of submission\\nof the corrective action plan, the office shall provide the district\\nwritten notice of such determination and the basis therefor, and mandate\\nthat the district take all necessary actions to implement the plan. If a\\ndistrict has failed, within a reasonable time thereafter as specified by\\nthe office based on the nature of the failure, which shall in no event\\nexceed sixty days, to make progress implementing any regulation, or any\\nother portion of such plan that is intended to prevent imminent danger\\nto the health, safety or welfare of the youth being served under the\\nplan, the office may withhold or set aside a portion of the funding due\\nunder subdivision eight of this section until the district demonstrates\\nthat sufficient progress is being made; or terminate the district's\\nauthority to operate all or a portion of the juvenile justice services\\nclose to home initiative, take all necessary steps to assume custody\\nfor, and provide services to, the applicable juvenile delinquents being\\nserved under the initiative, and discontinue funds provided to the\\ndistrict for such services. The office shall not withhold, set aside or\\ndiscontinue state aid to a district until written notice is given to the\\ncommissioner of the district, and in the event funding is withheld, set\\naside or discontinued, the district may appeal to the office, which\\nshall hold a fair hearing thereon in accordance with the provisions of\\nsection twenty-two of this chapter relating to fair hearings. The\\ndistrict may institute a proceeding for a review of the determination of\\nthe office following the fair hearing pursuant to article seventy-eight\\nof the civil practice law and rules. Any funds withheld, set aside or\\ndiscontinued pursuant to this provision shall be applied to address the\\nproblem which was the basis for such sanction. If the office terminates\\na district's authority to operate any portion of a juvenile justice\\nservices close to home initiative in accordance with this subdivision,\\nthe office shall notify the supervising family court judge responsible\\nfor the family courts serving such district of such termination and the\\neffective date of such termination.\\n  13.

provided that, if the\\ndistrict has an approved plan to implement services for juvenile\\ndelinquents placed in limited secure settings, a juvenile delinquent\\ntransferred to a non-secure facility from a limited secure facility may\\nbe returned to a limited secure facility upon a determination by the\\ndistrict that, for any reason, care and treatment at the non-secure\\nfacility is no longer suitable;\\n  (d) to cause a juvenile delinquent under the jurisdiction of the\\ndistrict who has run away from a facility run by the district or an\\nauthorized agency; or is conditionally released and has violated a\\ncondition of release therefrom, or if there is a change in circumstances\\nand the district determines that it would be consistent with the needs\\nand best interests of said juvenile delinquent and the need to protect\\nthe community; to be apprehended and returned to the district, detention\\nfacility, authorized agency, or program pursuant to regulations of the\\noffice of children and family services; provided further that:\\n  (i) a social services official shall give immediate written notice to\\nboth the office and the family court when any juvenile delinquent placed\\nwith the social services district is absent from such placement without\\nconsent;\\n  (ii) an authorized agency shall give immediate written notice to the\\noffice, the district and the family court when any juvenile delinquent\\nplaced by the district for care in such authorized agency is absent from\\nsuch placement without consent;\\n  (iii) a magistrate may cause a runaway or conditionally released\\njuvenile delinquent to be held in custody until returned to the\\ndistrict;\\n  (e) to issue a warrant for the apprehension and return of a juvenile\\ndelinquent under the jurisdiction of the district who has run away from\\na facility run by the district or an authorized agency;

The legislature finds that the rising incidence of adolescent\\npregnancy and teenage parenthood is the subject of a widespread and\\ngrowing concern. As a result of early pregnancy, the attainment of\\nneeded education and job skills is often curtailed. Coupled with the\\nadded responsibilities accompanying parenthood, these young families are\\noften locked into long term public dependency. Studies have confirmed\\nthat up to sixty percent of the current aid to families with dependent\\nchildren cases in New York state are headed by mothers who were\\nteenagers when they gave birth to their first child. In fact, the\\npredominant cause of welfare dependency in New York state may well be\\ndue to the result of teenage pregnancy and adolescent motherhood. The\\nobjective of this title is to increase the potential of these youths to\\nbecome financially independent by helping the teenager to complete her\\neducation, and receive sufficient manpower skills for participation in\\nthe labor market.\\n  The department of social services is not only statutorily required to\\nprovide financial support to these dependent teenagers and their\\nchildren, but also has equal responsibility to provide personal\\ncounselling and support services needed to strengthen family life and\\nprovide opportunities for economic independence. In order to facilitate\\naccessibility to the full range of needed services, case management\\nresponsibilities should be assigned to appropriate local social services\\nstaff or to authorized agencies outside of the department. Any\\nreluctance or refusal on the part of the teenager to participate in a\\nprogram of services shall not carry any threat of fiscal sanctions as\\nregards public assistance benefits. In the event that a teenager refuses\\nto participate, it shall be the responsibility of the local social\\nservices district to make continued and repeated efforts to engage the\\nteenager in a counselling relationship which has as its result a\\nmutually agreed upon service plan which meets the objectives of this\\ntitle.\\n  Therefore, this title provides for the establishment of a service case\\nmanagement system in order to strengthen the service role of the\\ndepartment of social services. Local social services districts shall be\\nrequired to separate public assistance cases involving pregnant\\nadolescents and teenage mothers under eighteen years of age, and assign\\nongoing case management services for such caseloads to appropriate staff\\nresponsible for service delivery. By defining such specialized\\ncaseloads, personal counselling and provision of needed community-based\\nsupport services will be facilitated. Such case management activities\\nshall also include the follow-up and evaluation of services rendered.\\n  The enactment of the provisions of this title shall maximize the\\neffectiveness, efficiency and accountability of support services\\nprovided on behalf of pregnant adolescents and teenage parents under\\neighteen years of age, thereby reducing the long-term dependency needs\\nof this youthful population.\\n",

Where the family is able to pay part or all of\\nthe costs of such care, payment of such fees as may be reasonable in the\\nlight of such ability shall be required.\\n  2.

The\\nlegislature finds and declares that a crisis exists in the availability\\nand quality of child day care in New York state and that this crisis\\nposes a danger both to the welfare and safety of the children and to the\\nproductivity of this state's workforce; that inadequate salaries and in\\nmany cases nonexistent benefit packages have substantially contributed\\nto the existing crisis by precluding day care centers from recruiting\\nand retaining necessary teaching and supervisory staff; that an\\nextremely high turnover rate has interfered in many instances with the\\nability of day care centers to comply with regulatory requirements and\\nto properly serve the children in their care; and that because of these\\nextraordinary circumstances New York state must intervene and provide\\nassistance for recruitment and retention of child care workers. The\\nlegislature recognizes that a long-term solution to this crisis will\\nrequire cooperative efforts among the business community, local and\\nstate governments and families.\\n  2. Within amounts appropriated specifically therefor, and after\\ndeducting funds as specified in subdivision three of this section the\\ncommissioner shall allocate funds to local social services districts for\\ngrants to eligible not-for-profit day care centers for retention and\\nrecruitment of teaching and supervisory staff, as follows:\\n  (a) a city social services district with a population in excess of one\\nmillion shall be allocated a portion of such funds based on an equal\\nweighting of:\\n  (i) its proportion of the state population of children aged five and\\nunder, and\\n  (ii) its proportion of total claims for reimbursement received by the\\ndepartment by May thirty-first, nineteen hundred eighty-eight for the\\nlow income, transitional and teen parent day care programs authorized by\\nchapter fifty-three of the laws of nineteen hundred eighty-seven.\\n  (b) all other eligible local social services districts shall be\\nallocated the remaining portion of funds based on each district's\\nproportionate share of licensed not-for-profit day care capacity\\nrelative to the total capacity of all such other eligible districts.\\n  3. Five percent of the funds appropriated for such recruitment and\\nretention purposes shall be reserved for administration of the program\\nand allocated as follows:\\n  (a) each local social services district shall be allocated an amount\\nequivalent to five percent of the funds it receives under paragraphs (a)\\nand (b) of subdivision two of this section, provided that no district\\nshall receive an amount less than twenty-five hundred dollars nor\\ngreater than one hundred fifty thousand dollars, and\\n  (b) remaining funds shall be allocated to the department. In the event\\nthat a not-for-profit child care resource and referral agency or the\\ndepartment distributes funds in an eligible district, as provided\\nherein, such agency or department may retain the amount that otherwise\\nwould be available to the eligible district.\\n  4. Not later than thirty days following the effective date of this\\nsection, the commissioner shall notify local social services districts\\nof the amounts allocated to each district and provide forms for the\\ncollecting of information pursuant to this section.\\n  5. For the purposes of this section, an eligible district shall mean a\\nlocal social services district that is providing, as of the effective\\ndate of this section, or which shall agree to provide in such written\\nform and by such date as shall be acceptable to the department,\\nsubsidized day care services under the special day care services program\\nauthorized by chapter fifty-three of the laws of nineteen hundred\\neighty-eight.\\n  6.

A social services district may use the\\nfunds allocated to it from the block grant to provide child care\\nassistance to:\\n  (a) families receiving public assistance when such child care\\nassistance is necessary: to enable a parent or caretaker relative to\\nengage in work, participate in work activities or perform a community\\nservice pursuant to title nine-B of article five of this chapter; to\\nenable a teenage parent to attend high school or other equivalent\\ntraining program; because the parent or caretaker relative is physically\\nor mentally incapacitated; or because family duties away from home\\nnecessitate the parent or caretaker relative's absence; child day care\\nshall be provided during breaks in activities, for a period of up to two\\nweeks. Such child day care may be authorized for a period of up to one\\nmonth if child care arrangements shall be lost if not continued, and the\\nprogram or employment is scheduled to begin within such period;\\n  (b) families with incomes up to two hundred percent of the state\\nincome standard who are attempting through work activities to transition\\noff of public assistance when such child care is necessary in order to\\nenable a parent or caretaker relative to engage in work provided such\\nfamilies' public assistance has been terminated as a result of increased\\nhours of or income from employment or increased income from child\\nsupport payments or the family voluntarily ended assistance; and,\\nprovided that the family received public assistance at least three of\\nthe six months preceding the month in which eligibility for such\\nassistance terminated or ended or provided that such family has received\\nchild care assistance under subdivision four of this section;\\n  (c) families with incomes up to two hundred percent of the state\\nincome standard which are determined in accordance with the regulations\\nof the department to be at risk of becoming dependent on family\\nassistance;\\n  (d) families with incomes up to two hundred percent of the state\\nincome standard who are attending a post secondary educational program\\nand working at least seventeen and one-half hours per week; and\\n  (e) other families with incomes up to two hundred percent of the state\\nincome standard which the social services district designates in its\\nconsolidated services plan as eligible for child care assistance in\\naccordance with criteria established by the department.\\n  2. For the purposes of this title, the term \"state income standard\"\\nmeans the most recent federal income official poverty line (as defined\\nand annually revised by the federal office of management and budget)\\nupdated by the department for a family size of four and adjusted by the\\ndepartment for family size.\\n  3. A social services district shall guarantee child care assistance to\\nfamilies in receipt of public assistance with children under thirteen\\nyears of age when such child care assistance is necessary for a parent\\nor caretaker relative to engage in work or participate in work\\nactivities pursuant to the provisions of title nine-B of article five of\\nthis chapter. Child care assistance shall continue to be guaranteed for\\nsuch a family for a period of twelve months after the month in which the\\nfamily's eligibility for public assistance has terminated or ended when\\nsuch child care is necessary in order to enable the parent or caretaker\\nrelative to engage in work, provided that the family's public assistance\\nhas been terminated as a result of an increase in the hours of or income\\nfrom employment or increased income from child support payments or\\nbecause the family voluntarily ended assistance; that the family\\nreceived public assistance in at least three of the six months preceding\\nthe month in which eligibility for such assistance terminated or ended\\nor provided that such family has received child care assistance under\\nsubdivision four of this section; and that the family's income does not\\nexceed two hundred percent of the state income standard. Such child day\\ncare shall recognize the need for continuity of care for the child and a\\ndistrict shall not move a child from an existing provider unless the\\nparticipant consents to such move.\\n  4. (a) Local social services districts shall guarantee applicants who\\nwould otherwise be eligible for, or are recipients of, public assistance\\nbenefits and who are employed, the option to choose to receive\\ncontinuing child day care subsidies in lieu of public assistance\\nbenefits, for such period of time as the recipient continues to be\\neligible for public assistance. For the purposes of this subdivision, an\\neligible applicant for, or recipient of, public assistance benefits and\\nwho is employed includes a person whose gross earnings equal, or are\\ngreater than, the required number of work hours times the state minimum\\nwage. Recipients of child care subsidies under this subdivision who are\\nno longer eligible for public assistance benefits, shall be eligible for\\ntransitional child care described in paragraph (b) of subdivision one of\\nthis section as if they had been recipients of public assistance.\\n  (b) Nothing herein shall be construed to waive the right of an\\napplicant who chooses to receive continuing child day care subsidies\\npursuant to this section from applying for ongoing public assistance.\\n  5. A family eligible for child care assistance under paragraph (a) of\\nsubdivision one of this section shall suffer no break in child care\\nservices and shall not be required to reapply for such assistance so\\nlong as eligibility under subdivision three of this section continues.\\n  6. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, rule or regulation to\\nthe contrary, applicants for child care subsidy assistance shall be\\nencouraged to obtain a child support order and shall be advised of the\\nbenefits of obtaining such orders. Provided however, no applicant for,\\nor recipient of, child care assistance under this title shall be\\nrequired to pursue, or to obtain, a court order for child support as a\\ncondition of eligibility for child care assistance.\\n  7. For purposes of determining financial eligibility under this title,\\nthe earned income of a dependent child under the age of eighteen, who is\\nnot legally responsible for the child or children for which child care\\nassistance is sought, shall be disregarded when determining the\\neligibility of a household for a child care subsidy.\\n  8. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, rule or regulations to\\nthe contrary, a social services district that implements a plan\\namendment to the child care portion of its child and family services\\nplan, either as part of an annual plan update, or through a separate\\nplan amendment process, where such amendment reduces eligibility for, or\\nincreases the family share percentage of, families receiving child care\\nservices, or that implements the process for closing child care cases as\\nset forth in the district's approved child and family services plan, due\\nto the district determining that it cannot maintain its current caseload\\nbecause all of the available funds are projected to be needed for open\\ncases, shall provide all families whose eligibility for child care\\nassistance or family share percentage will be impacted by such action\\nwith at least thirty days prior written notice of the action.\\n  9. Parents and caretakers who are otherwise eligible for child care\\nassistance, and provided with such assistance, shall be able to utilize\\nthe assistance when care is necessary to enable them to sleep because\\nthey work non-traditional hours and have a child who is under the age of\\nsix and not in school for a full school day. The authorization for child\\ncare assistance shall be sufficient to allow the parent to obtain up to\\neight hours of sleep, as needed.\\n",

Each social services district may\\nspend no more than five percent of its block grant allocation for\\nadministrative activities. The term \"administrative activities\" shall\\nnot include the costs of providing direct services.\\n  2. (a) A social services district may establish priorities for the\\nfamilies which will be eligible to receive funding; provided that the\\npriorities provide that eligible families will receive equitable access\\nto child care assistance funds to the extent that these funds are\\navailable.\\n  (b) A social services district shall set forth its priorities for\\nchild care assistance in the district's consolidated services plan. The\\ncommissioner of the office of children and family services shall not\\napprove any plan that does not provide for equitable access to child\\ncare assistance funds.\\n  (c) A social services district shall be authorized to set aside\\nportions of its block grant allocation to serve one or more of its\\npriority groups and/or to discontinue funding to families with lower\\npriorities in order to serve families with higher priorities; provided\\nthat the method of disbursement to priority groups provides that\\neligible families within a priority group will receive equitable access\\nto child care assistance funds to the extent that these funds are\\navailable.\\n  (d) Each social services district shall collect and submit to the\\ncommissioner of the office of children and family services in a manner\\nto be specified by the commissioner of the office of children and family\\nservices information concerning the disbursement of child care\\nassistance funds showing geographic distribution of children receiving\\nassistance within the district.\\n  (e) The commissioner of the office of children and family services\\nshall submit a report to the governor, temporary president of the senate\\nand the speaker of the assembly on or before August thirty-first, two\\nthousand one concerning the implementation of this section.

(a) The central register shall be capable of receiving telephone\\ncalls alleging child abuse or maltreatment and of immediately\\nidentifying prior reports of child abuse or maltreatment and capable of\\nmonitoring the provision of child protective service twenty-four hours a\\nday, seven days a week. To effectuate this purpose, but subject to the\\nprovisions of the appropriate local plan for the provision of child\\nprotective services, there shall be a single statewide telephone number\\nthat all persons, whether mandated by the law or not, may use to make\\ntelephone calls alleging child abuse or maltreatment and that all\\npersons so authorized by this title may use for determining the\\nexistence of prior reports in order to evaluate the condition or\\ncircumstances of a child.  In addition to the single statewide telephone\\nnumber, there shall be a special unlisted express telephone number and a\\ntelephone facsimile number for use only by persons mandated by law to\\nmake telephone calls, or to transmit telephone facsimile information on\\na form provided by the commissioner of children and family services,\\nalleging child abuse or maltreatment, and for use by all persons so\\nauthorized by this title for determining the existence of prior reports\\nin order to evaluate the condition or circumstances of a child. When any\\nallegations contained in such telephone calls could reasonably\\nconstitute a report of child abuse or maltreatment, such allegations and\\nany previous reports to the central registry involving the subject of\\nsuch report or children named in such report, including any previous\\nreport containing allegations of child abuse and maltreatment alleged to\\nhave occurred in other counties and districts in New York state shall be\\nimmediately transmitted orally or electronically by the office of\\nchildren and family services to the appropriate local child protective\\nservice for investigation.

If the records\\nindicate a previous report concerning a subject of the report, the child\\nalleged to be abused or maltreated, a sibling, other children in the\\nhousehold, other persons named in the report or other pertinent\\ninformation, the appropriate local child protective service shall be\\nimmediately notified of the fact.

(a) (i) At any time subsequent to the completion of the\\ninvestigation but in no event later than ninety days after the subject\\nof the report is notified that the report is indicated the subject may\\nrequest the commissioner to amend the record of the report. If the\\ncommissioner does not amend the report in accordance with such request\\nwithin ninety days of receiving the request, the subject shall have the\\nright to a fair hearing, held in accordance with paragraph (b) of this\\nsubdivision, to determine whether the record of the report in the\\ncentral register should be amended on the grounds that it is inaccurate\\nor it is being maintained in a manner inconsistent with this title.\\n  (ii) Upon receipt of a request to amend the record of a child abuse\\nand maltreatment report the office of children and family services shall\\nimmediately send a written request to the child protective service or\\nthe state agency which was responsible for investigating the allegations\\nof abuse or maltreatment for all records, reports and other information\\nmaintained by the service or state agency pertaining to such indicated\\nreport. The service or state agency shall as expeditiously as possible\\nbut within no more than twenty working days of receiving such request,\\nforward all records, reports and other information it maintains on such\\nindicated report to the office of children and family services. The\\noffice of children and family services shall as expeditiously as\\npossible but within no more than fifteen working days of receiving such\\nmaterials from the child protective service or state agency, review all\\nsuch materials in its possession concerning the indicated report and\\ndetermine, after affording such service or state agency a reasonable\\nopportunity to present its views, whether there is a fair preponderance\\nof the evidence to find that the subject committed the act or acts of\\nchild abuse or maltreatment giving rise to the indicated report and\\nwhether, based on guidelines developed by the office of children and\\nfamily services pursuant to subdivision five of section four hundred\\ntwenty-four-a of this title, such act or acts could be relevant and\\nreasonably related to employment of the subject of the report by a\\nprovider agency, as defined by subdivision three of section four hundred\\ntwenty-four-a of this title, or relevant and reasonably related to the\\nsubject of the report being allowed to have regular and substantial\\ncontact with children who are cared for by a provider agency, or\\nrelevant and reasonably related to the approval or disapproval of an\\napplication submitted by the subject of the report to a licensing\\nagency, as defined by subdivision four of section four hundred\\ntwenty-four-a of this title.\\n  (iii) If it is determined at the review held pursuant to this\\nparagraph (a) that there is no credible evidence in the record to find\\nthat the subject committed an act or acts of child abuse or\\nmaltreatment, the department shall amend the record to indicate that the\\nreport is \"unfounded\" and notify the subject forthwith.\\n  (iv) If it is determined at the review held pursuant to this paragraph\\n(a) that there is some credible evidence in the record to find that the\\nsubject committed such act or acts but that such act or acts could not\\nbe relevant and reasonably related to the employment of the subject by a\\nprovider agency or to the subject being allowed to have regular and\\nsubstantial contact with children who are cared for by a provider agency\\nor the approval or disapproval of an application which could be\\nsubmitted by the subject to a licensing agency, the department shall be\\nprecluded from informing a provider or licensing agency which makes an\\ninquiry to the department pursuant to the provisions of section four\\nhundred twenty-four-a of this title concerning the subject that the\\nperson about whom the inquiry is made is the subject of an indicated\\nreport of child abuse or maltreatment. The department shall notify\\nforthwith the subject of the report of such determinations and that a\\nfair hearing has been scheduled pursuant to paragraph (b) of this\\nsubdivision. The sole issue at such hearing shall be whether the subject\\nhas been shown by some credible evidence to have committed the act or\\nacts of child abuse or maltreatment giving rise to the indicated report.\\n  (v) If it is determined at the review held pursuant to this paragraph\\n(a) that there is some credible evidence in the record to prove that the\\nsubject committed an act or acts of child abuse or maltreatment and that\\nsuch act or acts could be relevant and reasonably related to the\\nemployment of the subject by a provider agency or to the subject being\\nallowed to have regular and substantial contact with children cared for\\nby a provider agency or the approval or disapproval of an application\\nwhich could be submitted by the subject to a licensing agency, the\\ndepartment shall notify forthwith the subject of the report of such\\ndeterminations and that a fair hearing has been scheduled pursuant to\\nparagraph (b) of this subdivision.\\n  (b) (i) If the department, within ninety days of receiving a request\\nfrom the subject that the record of a report be amended, does not amend\\nthe record in accordance with such request, the department shall\\nschedule a fair hearing and shall provide notice of the scheduled\\nhearing date to the subject, the statewide central register and, as\\nappropriate, to the child protective service or the state agency which\\ninvestigated the report.\\n  (ii) The burden of proof in such a hearing shall be on the child\\nprotective service or the state agency which investigated the report, as\\nthe case may be. In such a hearing, the fact that there is a family\\ncourt finding of abuse or neglect against the subject in regard to an\\nallegation contained in the report shall create an irrebuttable\\npresumption that said allegation is substantiated by some credible\\nevidence.\\n  (c) (i) If it is determined at the fair hearing that there is no\\ncredible evidence in the record to find that the subject committed an\\nact or acts of child abuse or maltreatment, the department shall amend\\nthe record to reflect that such a finding was made at the administrative\\nhearing, order any child protective service or state agency which\\ninvestigated the report to similarly amend its records of the report,\\nand shall notify the subject forthwith of the determination.\\n  (ii) Upon a determination made at a fair hearing held on or after\\nJanuary first, nineteen hundred eighty-six scheduled pursuant to the\\nprovisions of subparagraph (v) of paragraph (a) of this subdivision that\\nthe subject has been shown by a fair preponderance of the evidence to\\nhave committed the act or acts of child abuse or maltreatment giving\\nrise to the indicated report, the hearing officer shall determine, based\\non guidelines developed by the office of children and family services\\npursuant to subdivision five of section four hundred twenty-four-a of\\nthis title, whether such act or acts are relevant and reasonably related\\nto employment of the subject by a provider agency, as defined by\\nsubdivision three of section four hundred twenty-four-a of this title,\\nor relevant and reasonably related to the subject being allowed to have\\nregular and substantial contact with children who are cared for by a\\nprovider agency or relevant and reasonably related to the approval or\\ndisapproval of an application submitted by the subject to a licensing\\nagency, as defined by subdivision four of section four hundred\\ntwenty-four-a of this title.\\n  Upon a determination made at a fair hearing that the act or acts of\\nabuse or maltreatment are relevant and reasonably related to employment\\nof the subject by a provider agency or the subject being allowed to have\\nregular and substantial contact with children who are cared for by a\\nprovider agency or the approval or denial of an application submitted by\\nthe subject to a licensing agency, the department shall notify the\\nsubject forthwith. The department shall inform a provider or licensing\\nagency which makes an inquiry to the department pursuant to the\\nprovisions of section four hundred twenty-four-a of this title\\nconcerning the subject that the person about whom the inquiry is made is\\nthe subject of an indicated child abuse or maltreatment report.\\n  The failure to determine at the fair hearing that the act or acts of\\nabuse and maltreatment are relevant and reasonably related to the\\nemployment of the subject by a provider agency or to the subject being\\nallowed to have regular and substantial contact with children who are\\ncared for by a provider agency or the approval or denial of an\\napplication submitted by the subject to a licensing agency shall\\npreclude the department from informing a provider or licensing agency\\nwhich makes an inquiry to the department pursuant to the provisions of\\nsection four hundred twenty-four-a of this title concerning the subject\\nthat the person about whom the inquiry is made is the subject of an\\nindicated child abuse or maltreatment report.\\n  (d) The commissioner or his or her designated agent is hereby\\nauthorized and empowered to make any appropriate order respecting the\\namendment of a record to make it accurate or consistent with the\\nrequirements of this title.\\n  (e) Should the department grant the request of the subject of the\\nreport pursuant to this subdivision either through an administrative\\nreview or fair hearing to amend an indicated report to an unfounded\\nreport. Such report shall be legally sealed and shall be released and\\nexpunged in accordance with the standards set forth in subdivision five\\nof this section.\\n  9. Written notice of any expungement or amendment of any record, made\\npursuant to the provisions of this title, shall be served forthwith upon\\neach subject of such record, other persons named in the report, the\\ncommissioner, and, as appropriate, the applicable local child protective\\nservice, the justice center for the protection of people with special\\nneeds, department of education, office of mental health, office for\\npeople with developmental disabilities, the local social services\\ncommissioner or school district placing the child, any attorney for the\\nchild appointed to represent the child whose appointment has been\\ncontinued by a family court judge during the term of a child's\\nplacement, and the director or operator of a residential care facility\\nor program. The local child protective service or the state agency which\\ninvestigated the report, upon receipt of such notice, shall take the\\nappropriate similar action in regard to its child abuse and maltreatment\\nregister and records and inform, for the same purpose, any other agency\\nwhich received such record.\\n  12. Any person who willfully permits and any person who encourages the\\nrelease of any data and information contained in the central register to\\npersons or agencies not permitted by this title shall be guilty of a\\nclass A misdemeanor.\\n  13. There shall be a single statewide telephone number for use by all\\npersons seeking general information about child abuse, maltreatment or\\nwelfare other than for the purpose of making a report of child abuse or\\nmaltreatment.\\n  14.

The legislature finds that children\\nwho are in care away from their own homes on a full time basis, whether\\ntemporarily or for a prolonged period, require effective supervision and\\nreview of their status in care and of the plans for them.  It is the\\npolicy of the state of New York to assure that such children are\\nappropriately placed, that needed services are provided to them and\\ntheir families, and that unnecessary and prolonged placements are\\navoided.  The legislature further finds that this policy is often\\nfrustrated, and fiscal and program accountability have not been promoted\\nbecause of divergent and overlapping jurisdictions of various government\\nand private agencies; the lack of coordination among programs of these\\nagencies; and the excessive workloads of judicial personnel, social\\nservices workers, and others responsible for reviewing the status in\\ncare of these children.\\n  2.  To assist in overcoming these difficulties, it is the intent of\\nthe legislature to establish a statewide management assistance system to\\nbe called the child care review service.  The service shall be designed\\nand operated to effectuate the following purposes:\\n  (a)  identification and assessment of the needs and problems of\\nchildren in care and their families, to effectuate meaningful case\\nplanning;\\n  (b)  case management and supervision by child care agencies of\\nchildren in full-time care away from their homes;\\n  (c)  supervision and evaluation by state agencies of local and\\nvoluntary child care agency performance;\\n  (d)  planning and policy making by state agencies, the governor and\\nthe legislature;\\n  (e)  meeting in a timely manner all judicial review requirements of\\nthis chapter, the family court act and any other applicable provisions\\nof law;\\n  (f)  reduction of the need for manual form preparation; and\\n  (g)  meeting federal reporting requirements so as to qualify for\\nfederal funds under the federal social security act.\\n",

Notwithstanding any\\ninconsistent provision of law, pursuant to regulations of the office of\\nchildren and family services, every local social services district shall\\nas a component of the district's multi-year consolidated services child\\nwelfare services plan address the child welfare services needs of\\nsexually exploited children and to the extent that funds are available\\nspecifically therefor ensure that a short-term safe house or another\\nshort-term safe placement such as an approved runaway and homeless youth\\nprogram, approved respite or crisis program providing crisis\\nintervention or respite services or community-based program to serve\\nsexually exploited children is available to children residing in such\\ndistrict. Nothing in this section shall prohibit a local social services\\ndistrict from utilizing existing respite or crisis intervention services\\nalready operated by such social services district or homeless youth\\nprograms or services for victims of human trafficking pursuant to\\narticle ten-D of this chapter so long as the staff members have received\\nappropriate training approved by the office of children and family\\nservices regarding sexually exploited children and the existing programs\\nand facilities provide a safe, secure and appropriate environment for\\nsexually exploited children. Crisis intervention services, short-term\\nsafe house care and community-based programming may, where appropriate,\\nbe provided by the same not-for-profit agency. Local social services\\ndistricts may work cooperatively to provide such short-term safe house\\nor other short-term safe placement, services and programming and access\\nto such placement, services and programming may be provided on a\\nregional basis, provided, however, that every local social services\\ndistrict shall to the extent that funds are available ensure that such\\nplacement, services and programs shall be readily accessible to sexually\\nexploited children residing within the district.\\n  2. All of the services created under this title may, to the extent\\npossible provided by law, be available to all sexually exploited\\nchildren whether they are accessed voluntarily, as a condition of an\\nadjournment in contemplation of dismissal issued in criminal court,\\nthrough the diversion services created under section seven hundred\\nthirty-five of the family court act, through a proceeding under article\\nthree of the family court act, a proceeding under article ten of the\\nfamily court act or through a referral from a local social services\\nagency.\\n  3. The capacity of the crisis intervention services and\\ncommunity-based programs in subdivision one of this section shall be\\nbased on the number of sexually exploited children in each district who\\nare in need of such services. A determination of such need shall be made\\nin two thousand ten and every five years thereafter in every social\\nservices district by the local commissioner of social services and be\\nincluded in the integrated county plan. Such determination shall be made\\nin consultation with local law enforcement, runaway and homeless youth\\nprogram providers, local probation departments, local social services\\ncommissioners, the runaway and homeless youth coordinator for the local\\nsocial services district, local law guardians, presentment agencies,\\npublic defenders and district attorney's offices and child advocates and\\nservices providers who work directly with sexually exploited youth.\\n  4. In determining the need for and capacity of the services created\\nunder this section, each local social services district shall recognize\\nthat sexually exploited youth have separate and distinct service needs\\naccording to gender and, where a local social services district\\ndetermines that the need exists, to the extent that funds are available,\\nappropriate programming shall be made available.\\n  5. To the extent funds are specifically appropriated therefor, the\\noffice of children and family services shall contract with an\\nappropriate not-for-profit agency with experience working with sexually\\nexploited children to operate at least one long-term safe house in a\\ngeographically appropriate area of the state which shall provide safe\\nand secure long term housing and specialized services for sexually\\nexploited children throughout the state. The appropriateness of the\\ngeographic location shall be determined taking into account the areas of\\nthe state with high numbers of sexually exploited children and the need\\nfor sexually exploited children to find shelter and long term placement\\nin a region that cannot be readily accessed by the perpetrators of\\nsexual exploitation. The need for more than one long-term safe house\\nshall be determined by the office of children and family services based\\non the numbers and geographical location of sexually exploited children\\nwithin the state. Nothing herein shall be construed to preclude an\\nagency from applying for and accepting grants, gifts and bequests of\\nfunds from private individuals, foundations and the federal government\\nfor the purpose of creating or carrying out the duties of a long-term\\nsafe house.\\n  6. The local social services commissioner may, to the extent that\\nfunds are available, in conjunction with the division of criminal\\njustice services and local law enforcement officials, contract with an\\nappropriate not-for-profit agency with experience working with sexually\\nexploited children to train law enforcement officials who are likely to\\nencounter sexually exploited children in the course of their law\\nenforcement duties on the provisions of this section and how to identify\\nand obtain appropriate services for sexually exploited children. Local\\nsocial services districts may work cooperatively to provide such\\ntraining and such training may be provided on a regional basis.

If, however, there is no willing or suitable\\nperson to be appointed as guardian, or the child does not consent to the\\nappointment of a guardian, such subsidy payments shall be made\\nretroactively from the death of the adoptive parent or parents and shall\\ncontinue to be made until the twenty-first birthday of the child: (i)\\nthrough direct payments to the child, if the social services official\\ndetermines that the child demonstrates the ability to manage such direct\\npayments; or (ii) to a representative payee certified by the social\\nservices official.\\n  (f) Upon receipt of notification of the death of the sole or surviving\\nadoptive parent or both adoptive parents after the eighteenth birthday\\nand before the twenty-first birthday of the adopted child, where such\\nadoptive parent or parents were receiving adoption subsidy payments at\\nthe time of death, the social services official shall notify the child\\nof: (i) the processes available to continue subsidy payments until the\\ntwenty-first birthday of the child including appointment of a guardian\\nunder the surrogate's court procedure act, application to be approved\\nfor direct subsidy payments, or the appointment of a representative\\npayee; and (ii) the right of the child to be involved in all such\\nprocesses.\\n  (g) Where the social services official has determined that the child\\ndoes not demonstrate the ability to manage direct subsidy payments, the\\nsocial services official shall certify payment to a representative payee\\non behalf of the child. Subsidy payments received by the representative\\npayee shall be held and used strictly for the use and benefit of the\\nchild. Designation of the appropriate entity or individual and\\ninvestigation of an individual for certification as a representative\\npayee shall be conducted by the social services official responsible for\\npayment of the adoption subsidy pursuant to this section.\\n  (i) The social services official may designate an employee of the\\nsocial services district to be the representative payee responsible for\\nreceipt of the adoption subsidy on behalf of the child only where the\\nofficial determines that such employee has no conflict of interest in\\nperforming the duties and obligations as representative payee. If the\\nchild resides in a social services district other than the district\\nresponsible for payment of the adoption subsidy, the social services\\ndistrict in which the child resides may be designated the representative\\npayee and a social services official of such district shall select an\\nemployee of such social services district to be responsible for receipt\\nof the adoption subsidy as the representative payee, only where the\\nofficial determines that such employee has no conflict of interest in\\nperforming the duties and obligations as a payee. Where a voluntary\\nauthorized agency has a prior relationship with a child, or where the\\nsocial services district does not have sufficient or appropriate staff\\navailable to perform the functions of the representative payee, the\\nsocial services district may contract with a voluntary authorized agency\\nas the representative payee on behalf of the child where the social\\nservices district determines it would be in the best interests of the\\nchild to do so.\\n  (ii) The social services official may designate an individual for\\ncertification as a representative payee who shall perform the functions\\nand duties of a representative payee in accordance with the best\\ninterests of the child. In determining whether an individual is\\nappropriate to be certified as the representative payee, the social\\nservices official shall first consult with the child and shall give the\\nchild's preferences significant weight. The child's preference shall be\\ndeterminative of the representative payee only where such preference\\ndoes not conflict with the best interests of the child. Prior to\\ndesignation of an individual by the social services official for\\ncertification as a representative payee, the social services official\\nshall:\\n  (A) collect proof of identity and a verifiable social security number\\nof the nominated representative payee;\\n  (B) conduct an in-person interview of the individual;\\n  (C) investigate any potential conflicts of interest that may ensue if\\nsuch individual is certified; and\\n  (D) determine the capabilities and qualifications of the individual to\\nmanage the subsidy payment for the child.\\n  (iii) (A) If, after completion of the investigation, the social\\nservices official is satisfied that the individual is qualified,\\nappropriate and will serve the best interests of the child, the social\\nservices official shall certify the selected individual as the\\nrepresentative payee for the child.\\n  (B) If the twenty-first birthday of the child occurs while awaiting\\nthe certification of a representative payee, the child shall be entitled\\nto retroactive direct payment of subsidy payments since the death of the\\nadoptive parent or parents after the eighteenth birthday of the child.\\n  (iv) The representative payee shall submit reports to the social\\nservices official no less than once a year describing the use of the\\npayments in the preceding year. Such reports shall be submitted by\\nDecember thirty-first of each year. The social services official may\\nalso request reports from time to time from the representative payee. If\\na representative payee fails to submit a report, the social services\\nofficial may require that the representative payee appear in person to\\ncollect payments. The social services official shall keep a centralized\\nfile and update it periodically with information including the addresses\\nand social security or tax-payer identification numbers of the\\nrepresentative payee and the child.\\n  (v) The social services official shall revoke the certification of a\\nrepresentative payee upon:\\n  (A) determining that the representative payee has misused the payments\\nintended for the benefit of the child;\\n  (B) the failure of the representative payee to submit timely reports\\nor appear in person as required by the social services official after\\nsuch failure; or\\n  (C) the request of the child upon good cause shown.\\n  (vi) The social services official shall notify the child of the\\ncontact information of the representative payee within five days of\\nmaking a designation.\\n  (vii) A child may appeal the refusal of the social services official\\nto certify the individual preferred by the child for certification as\\nthe representative payee or revoke the certification of a representative\\npayee upon request of the child pursuant to section four hundred\\nfifty-five of this title.\\n  2. The agreement provided for in subdivision one of this section shall\\nbe subject to the approval of the department upon the application of the\\nsocial services official; provided, however, that in accordance with the\\nregulations of the department, the department may authorize the social\\nservices official to approve or disapprove the agreement on behalf of\\nthe department. In either situation, if the agreement is not approved or\\ndisapproved by the social services official within thirty days of\\nsubmission, the voluntary authorized agency may submit the agreement\\ndirectly to the department for approval or disapproval. If the agreement\\nis not disapproved in writing by the department within thirty days after\\nits submission to the department, it shall be deemed approved. Any such\\ndisapproval shall be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons\\ntherefor.\\n  3. The amount of the monthly payment made pursuant to this section\\nshall be determined pursuant to regulations of the department and based\\nupon the financial need of such persons. The department shall review\\nsuch regulations annually. The amount of the monthly payment shall not\\nbe less than seventy-five per centum of the board rate nor more than one\\nhundred per centum of such rate.\\n  4.

(a) The operating certificate of any facility may be revoked,\\nsuspended or limited upon a determination by the department that the\\nfacility has failed to comply with the requirements of state or local\\nlaws or regulations applicable to the operation of such facility.\\n  (b) No operating certificate shall be revoked, suspended or limited\\nwithout a hearing held in accordance with procedures established by\\ndepartment regulations, which procedures shall require that notice of\\nthe time and place of the hearing, and notice of the charges, shall be\\nserved in person or by certified mail addressed to the facility at least\\nthirty days prior to the date of the hearing. A written answer to the\\ncharges may be filed with the department not less than ten business days\\nprior to the date of the hearing.

Service in such an action shall state the\\nnature of the violation and shall be accomplished in the manner\\nprescribed by the civil practice law and rules; provided, however, that\\nan ex parte order for equitable relief may issue, notwithstanding the\\ncivil practice law and rules, if the court finds, on motion and\\naffidavit, that such violation may reasonably be expected to result in\\nimminent danger to the public health or to the health, safety or welfare\\nof any individual in a facility subject to the department's inspection\\nand supervision.

The regulations shall specify the violations subject to penalty\\nand the amount of the penalty to be assessed in connection with each\\nsuch violation and shall specify that only civil penalties of up to one\\nthousand dollars per day per violation shall be assessed pursuant to\\nthis paragraph against an adult care facility found responsible for an\\nact of retaliation or reprisal against any resident, employee, or other\\nperson for having filed a complaint with or having provided information\\nto any long term care patient ombudsman functioning in accordance with\\nsection five hundred forty-four or five hundred forty-five of the\\nexecutive law.\\n  (b) (1) In addition to any other civil or criminal penalty provided by\\nlaw, the department shall have the power to assess civil penalties in\\naccordance with its regulations adopted pursuant to paragraph (a) of\\nthis subdivision, after a hearing conducted in accordance with the\\nprocedures established by regulations of the department. Such procedures\\nshall require that notice of the time and place of the hearing, together\\nwith a statement of charges of violations, shall be served in person or\\nby certified mail addressed to the facility at least thirty days prior\\nto the date of the hearing. The statement of charges of violations shall\\nset forth the existence of the violations, the amount of penalty for\\nwhich it may become liable and the steps which must be taken to rectify\\nthe violation and, where applicable, a statement that the department\\ncontends that a penalty may be imposed under this paragraph regardless\\nof rectification. An answer to the charges of violations, in writing,\\nshall be filed with the department, not less than ten days prior to the\\ndate of hearing. The answer shall notify the department of the\\nfacility's position with respect to each of the charges and shall\\ninclude all matters which if not disclosed in the answer would be likely\\nto take the department by surprise. The commissioner, or a member of his\\nstaff who is designated and authorized by him to hold such hearing, may\\nin his discretion allow the facility to prove any matter not included in\\nthe answer. Where the facility satisfactorily demonstrates that it\\neither had rectified the violations within thirty days of receiving\\nwritten notification of the results of the inspection pursuant to\\nsection four hundred sixty-one-a of this chapter, or had submitted\\nwithin thirty days an acceptable plan for rectification and was\\nrectifying the violations in accordance with the steps and within the\\nadditional periods of time as accepted by the department in such plan,\\nno penalty shall be imposed, except as provided in subparagraph two of\\nthis paragraph.\\n  (2) Rectification shall not preclude the assessment of a penalty if\\nthe department establishes at a hearing that a particular violation,\\nalthough corrected, endangered or resulted in harm to any resident as\\nthe result of:\\n  (i) the total or substantial failure of the facility's fire detection\\nor prevention systems, or emergency evacuation procedures prescribed by\\ndepartment safety standard regulations;\\n  (ii) the retention of any resident who has been evaluated by the\\nresident's physician as being medically or mentally unsuited for care in\\nthe facility or as requiring placement in a hospital or residential\\nhealth care facility and for whom the operator is not making persistent\\nefforts to secure appropriate placement;\\n  (iii) the failure in systemic practices and procedures;\\n  (iv) the failure of the operator to take actions as required by\\ndepartment regulations in the event of a resident's illness or accident;\\n  (v) the failure of the operator to provide at all times supervision of\\nresidents by numbers of staff at least equivalent to the night staffing\\nrequirement set forth in department regulations; or\\n  (vi) unreasonable threats of retaliation or taking reprisals,\\nincluding but not limited to unreasonable threats of eviction or\\nhospitalization against any resident, employee or other person who makes\\na complaint concerning the operation of an adult care facility,\\nparticipates in the investigation of a complaint or is the subject of an\\naction identified in a complaint.\\n  The department shall specify in its regulations those regulations to\\nwhich this subparagraph two shall apply.\\n  (3) In assessing penalties pursuant to this paragraph, the department\\nshall consider promptness of rectification, delay occasioned by the\\ndepartment, and the specific circumstances of the violations as\\nmitigating factors.\\n  (c) Upon the request of the department, the attorney general may\\ncommence an action in any court of competent jurisdiction against any\\nfacility subject to the provisions of this section, and against any\\nperson or corporation operating such facility, for the recovery of any\\npenalty assessed by the department in accordance with the provisions of\\nthis subdivision.\\n  (d) Any such penalty assessed by the department may be released or\\ncompromised by the department before the matter has been referred to the\\nattorney general, and where such matter has been referred to the\\nattorney general, any such penalty may be released or compromised and\\nany action commenced to recover the same may be settled and discontinued\\nby the attorney general with the consent of the department.\\n  8. Whenever the commissioner, after investigation, finds that any\\nperson, agency or facility subject to this article is causing, engaging\\nin or maintaining a condition or activity which constitutes a danger to\\nthe physical or mental health of the residents of a facility subject to\\nthe inspection and supervision of the department, and that it therefore\\nappears to be prejudicial to the interests of such residents to delay\\naction for thirty days until an opportunity for a hearing can be\\nprovided in accordance with the provisions of this section, the\\ncommissioner shall order the person, agency or facility by written\\nnotice, setting forth the basis for such finding, to discontinue such\\ndangerous condition or activity or take certain action immediately or\\nwithin a specified period of less than thirty days. The commissioner\\nshall within thirty days of issuance of the order provide the person,\\nagency or facility an opportunity to be heard and to present any proof\\nthat such condition or activity does not constitute a danger to the\\nhealth of such residents.\\n  9. (a) The department shall have authority to impose a civil penalty\\nnot exceeding one thousand dollars per day against, and to issue an\\norder requiring the closing of, after notice and opportunity to be\\nheard, any facility which does not possess a valid operating certificate\\nissued by the department and is an adult care facility subject to the\\nprovisions of this article and the regulations of the department. A\\nhearing shall be conducted in accordance with procedures established by\\ndepartment regulations which procedures shall require that notice of the\\ndetermination that the facility is an adult care facility and the\\nreasons for such determination and notice of the time and place of the\\nhearing be served in person on the operator, owner or prime lessor, if\\nany, or by certified mail, return receipt requested, addressed to such\\nperson and received at least twenty days prior to the date of the\\nhearing. If such operator, owner or prime lessor, if any, is not known\\nto the department, then service may be made by posting a copy thereof in\\na conspicuous place within the facility or by sending a copy thereof by\\ncertified mail, return receipt requested, addressed to the facility.

As a means of\\nprotecting the health, safety and welfare of the residents of an adult\\ncare facility subject to inspection and supervision by the department,\\nit may become necessary under certain circumstances to authorize the\\ncontinuing operation of such facility for a temporary period by a court\\nappointed receiver, at the discretion of the commissioner, as provided\\nin this section or with respect to an adult home, enriched housing\\nprogram or residence for adults, a receiver approved by the department\\nof health pursuant to written agreement between the department and the\\noperator or operators of such facility, provided that such agreement\\nshall not exceed a period of sixty days but may be extended for an\\nadditional sixty day period upon agreement by the parties.\\n  2. The operator or operators of any adult home, enriched housing\\nprogram or residence for adults may at any time request the department\\nof health to appoint a receiver to take over the operation of such\\nfacility. Upon receiving such a request, the department of health may,\\nif it deems such action desirable, enter into an agreement with any such\\noperator or operators for the appointment of a receiver to take charge\\nof the facility under whatever conditions as shall be found acceptable\\nby the parties, provided that such agreement shall not exceed a period\\nof sixty days but may be extended for an additional sixty day period\\nupon agreement by the parties.\\n  3. (a) In the event of a transfer of possession of the premises of\\nsuch facility from an approved operator to a court appointed receiver in\\na bankruptcy or mortgage foreclosure proceeding, the department may\\nauthorize such court appointed receiver to continue to operate such\\nfacility for a temporary period pending the filing and review of an\\napplication to the department by such receiver or by another person for\\nan operating certificate, provided, however, that such court appointed\\nreceiver agrees to operate the facility during such temporary period in\\naccordance with such terms and conditions as may be set by the\\ndepartment, which terms and conditions shall include compliance with all\\napplicable provisions of law and regulations of the department, and\\nwhich shall include a waiver by the receiver of any assessment of fees\\nagainst the department, the commissioner and the state. Such application\\nfor an operating certificate shall be filed within ninety days after the\\ntransfer of possession to the receiver, unless the time for such filing\\nis extended by the department.\\n  (b) The commissioner may make application to appear and advise the\\ncourt of any objections he may have to the transfer of possession from\\nthe approved operator to any other person including a receiver or of any\\nobjections he may have to continuing a receiver or any other person in\\npossession.\\n  (c) After a receiver obtains such temporary authorization, he may\\noperate such facility only so long as he continues to do so in\\ncompliance with the applicable law, regulations of the department, and\\nthe terms and conditions for such authorization as set by the\\ndepartment.\\n  4. (a) When the department revokes or temporarily suspends the\\noperating certificate of such facility and the commissioner determines\\nthat appointment of a receiver is necessary to protect the health,\\nsafety and welfare of the residents of a facility the commissioner may\\napply to the supreme court in the county where the facility is situated\\nfor an order directing the operators, owners and prime lessors, if any,\\nof the premises to show cause why the commissioner, or at the discretion\\nof the commissioner, his designee, should not be appointed receiver to\\ntake charge of the facility. Such order to show cause shall be\\nreturnable not less than five days after service is completed and shall\\nprovide for personal service of a copy thereof and the papers on which\\nit is based on the operators, owners and prime lessors, if any, of the\\npremises. If any such operator, owner or prime lessor cannot with due\\ndiligence be served personally within the county where the property is\\nlocated and within the time fixed in such order, then service may be\\nmade on such person by posting a copy thereof in a conspicuous place\\nwithin the facility in question, and by sending a copy thereof by\\nregistered mail, return receipt requested, to such operator, owner or\\nprime lessor at the last address reported to the department, or\\notherwise known to the department.\\n  (b) On the return of said order to show cause, determination shall\\nhave precedence over every other business of the court unless the court\\nshall find that some other pending proceeding, having similar statutory\\nprecedence, shall have priority. The court may conduct a hearing at\\nwhich all interested parties shall have the opportunity to present\\nevidence pertaining to the application. If the court shall find that the\\nfacts warrant the granting thereof, then the commissioner, or at the\\ndiscretion of the commissioner, any person designated by the\\ncommissioner, shall be appointed receiver to take charge of the\\nfacility. Except in the case where the receiver is assuming an existing\\nbona fide arms length lease, the commissioner shall determine a\\nreasonable monthly rental for the facility, based on consideration of\\nall appropriate factors, including the condition of such facility. The\\nrent as determined by the commissioner shall be paid by the receiver to\\nthe owners or prime lessors as may be directed by the court for each\\nmonth that the receivership remains in effect, provided, however that\\nnothing contained herein shall be construed to alter or diminish any\\nobligation the operator may have under any currently valid lease.\\n  (c) Any receiver appointed pursuant to this subdivision shall have all\\nof the powers and duties of a receiver appointed in an action to\\nforeclose a mortgage on real property, together with such additional\\npowers and duties as are herein granted and imposed. The receiver shall\\nwith all reasonable speed but, in any case, within six months after the\\ndate on which the receivership was ordered, unless otherwise extended by\\nthe court, provide for the orderly transfer of all residents in the\\nfacility to other facilities or make other provisions for their\\ncontinued safety and care. He shall, during this period, operate the\\nfacility in compliance with the applicable law and regulations of the\\ndepartment, and shall have such additional powers, approved by the\\ncommissioner, to incur expenses as may be necessary to so operate the\\nfacility. The receiver shall not be required to file any bond. He shall\\ncollect incoming payments from all sources and apply them to the costs\\nincurred in the performance of his functions as receiver. The receiver\\nshall honor all existing leases, mortgages and chattel mortgages that\\nhad previously been undertaken as obligations of the owners or operators\\nof the facility. No security interest in any real or personal property\\ncomprising the facility or contained within the facility, or in any\\nfixture of the facility, shall be impaired or diminished in priority by\\nthe receiver. The receiver shall compensate the owners of any goods held\\nin inventory for those goods which he uses or causes to be used by\\nreimbursing the costs of such goods, except that no such compensation\\nshall be made for any such goods for which such owners have already been\\nreimbursed.\\n  (d) (i) The receiver shall be entitled to a fee and reimbursement for\\nexpenses as determined by the commissioner, based upon consideration of\\nall appropriate factors relating to the operation of the facility, to be\\npaid as a charge against the operator, not to exceed the fees,\\ncommissions and necessary expenses authorized to be paid to receivers in\\nan action to foreclose a mortgage.\\n  (ii) The receiver shall be liable only in his official capacity for\\ninjury to person and property by reason of conditions of the facility in\\na case where an owner would have been liable; he shall not have any\\nliability in his personal capacity, except for gross negligence and\\nintentional acts.\\n  (iii) The receiver appointed pursuant to this subdivision may, subject\\nto approval by the commissioner, ratify any collective bargaining\\nagreement in effect between the operator and the employees of a\\nfacility, or suspend such collective bargaining agreement, provided\\nhowever, that he remain liable for payment of wages and salaries at the\\nrates and levels in effect at the time of his appointment.\\n  (iv) (A) The receiver shall notify the commissioner of any lien or\\nconveyance made in contemplation of receivership with an intent to\\nremove an asset of the facility from the jurisdiction and use of the\\nreceiver, or to hinder or delay the receiver in the execution of his\\nduties and responsibilities as receiver; such notice shall be forwarded\\nto the commissioner in a manner to be determined by regulations of the\\ndepartment.\\n  (B) With respect to any such lien or conveyance, the commissioner\\nshall have available any remedy available to a trustee in a bankruptcy\\nproceeding pursuant to the federal bankruptcy act or any remedy\\navailable to a creditor in a proceeding pursuant to article ten of the\\ndebtor and creditor law and may apply to the court to have such lien or\\nconveyance set aside, or to have the court make any order which the\\ncircumstances of the case may require.\\n  (e) (i) The court shall terminate the receivership only under any of\\nthe following circumstances:\\n  a. six months after the date on which it was ordered, except that the\\ncourt may extend such period for good cause shown;\\n  b. when the department grants the facility a new operating\\ncertificate; or\\n  c. at such time as all of the residents in the facility have been\\nprovided alternative modes of care, either in another facility or\\notherwise; provided, that the residents shall not be removed from the\\nfacility unless it is required for the protection of the health, safety\\nor welfare of the residents.\\n  (ii) At the time of termination of the receivership, the receiver\\nshall render a full and complete accounting to the court and shall\\ndispose of any profit or surplus money at the direction of the court.\\n  (f) (i) Any person who is served a copy of an order of the court\\nappointing the receiver shall, upon being notified of the name and\\naddress of the receiver, make all payments for goods supplied by the\\nfacility, or services rendered by the facility, to the receiver. A\\nreceipt shall be given for each such payment, and copies of all such\\nreceipts shall be kept on file by the receiver. The amount so received\\nshall be deposited by the receiver in a special account which shall also\\nbe used for all disbursements made by the receiver.\\n  (ii) Any person refusing or omitting to make such a payment after such\\nservice and notice may be sued therefor by the receiver. Such person\\nshall not in such suit dispute the authority of the receiver to incur or\\norder such expenses, or the right of the receiver to have such payments\\nmade to him. The receipt of the receiver for any sum paid to him shall,\\nin all suits and proceedings and for every purpose, be as effectual in\\nfavor of any person holding the same as actual payment of the amount\\nthereof to the owner or other person or persons who would, but for the\\nprovisions of this subdivision, have been entitled to receive the sum so\\npaid. No resident shall be discharged, nor shall any contract or rights\\nbe forfeited or impaired, nor any forfeiture or liability be incurred,\\nby reason of any omission to pay any owner, contractor or other person\\nany sum so paid to the receiver.\\n  (g) Any other provision of this chapter notwithstanding, the\\ndepartment may, if it deems appropriate, grant to any facility operating\\nor scheduled to operate under a receivership authorized by this\\nsubdivision an operating certificate the duration of which shall be\\nlimited to the duration of the receivership.\\n  (h) (i) No provision contained herein shall be deemed to relieve the\\noperators, owners or prime lessors, if any, of any civil or criminal\\nliability or obligation incurred, or any duty imposed by law, by reason\\nof acts or omissions of such persons prior to the appointment of any\\nreceiver hereunder. During the period a facility is operated by a\\nreceiver, the operator, owner or prime lessor, if any, shall continue to\\nbe liable for all obligations for the payment of taxes or other\\noperating and maintenance expenses of the facility and the owner or\\nother appropriate person shall continue to be liable for the payment of\\nmortgages or liens.\\n  (ii) Expenses incurred by a receiver to meet the operating and\\nmaintenance expenses of the facility and the basic needs of the\\nresidents of the facility shall be deemed the obligations of the\\noperator, and not the obligation of the receiver or the state.\\n  (iii) The receiver shall not be responsible for any obligations\\nincurred by the owner, operator or prime lessor, if any, prior to the\\nappointment of the receiver.\\n  (iv) The receiver shall be entitled to use for operating and\\nmaintenance expenses and the basic needs of the residents of the\\nfacility a portion of the revenues due the operator during the month in\\nwhich the receiver is appointed which portion shall be established on\\nthe basis of the amounts of the operating and maintenance expenses for\\nsuch month.\\n  (v) Any sums determined to be due and owing by the receiver to the\\nowner, operator or prime lessor shall be off-set by any charges\\ndetermined to be the obligations of the owner, operator or prime lessor.\\n  5. (a) Subject to paragraph (c) of this subdivision, the commissioner\\nis authorized to make payments to receivers appointed pursuant to the\\nprovisions of subdivision three of this section, only if the receiver\\ndemonstrates to the satisfaction of the commissioner that the facility's\\nfunds which are available are insufficient to meet operating and\\nmaintenance expenses of the facility and the basic needs of the\\nresidents of the facility.\\n  (b) The operator of a facility operated by a receiver pursuant to the\\nprovisions of subdivision three of this section shall be liable for all\\nmonies made available to the receiver pursuant to the provisions of\\nparagraph (a) of this subdivision.\\n  (c) To the extent funds are appropriated, payments made pursuant to\\nthis section shall be made from the local assistance fund and such\\npayments shall be made only if a certificate of allocation and a\\nschedule of amounts to be available therefor shall have been issued by\\nthe director of the budget, upon the recommendation of the commissioner\\nof social services, and a copy of such certificate filed with the\\ncomptroller, the chairman of the senate finance committee and the\\nchairman of the assembly ways and means committee.

Nothing contained in this section shall be construed to require the\\ncommissioner to seek the appointment of a receiver or to assume the\\nresponsibilities of a receiver directly or indirectly through his\\ndesignee; nor shall this section authorize any court to compel the\\ncommissioner to assume the responsibilities of a receiver or to appoint\\na designee to assume such responsibilities.\\n",

              "text" : "  § 464-a. Legislative findings. The legislature hereby finds,\\ndetermines, and declares that:\\n  1. In rural areas there is a necessity to promote different approaches\\nto human services delivery if programs are to properly address diverse\\ncommunity and individual needs and such unique rural conditions as low\\npopulation density; a large proportion of elderly persons; the absence\\nof economies of scale; geographic isolation; inadequate transportation;\\nfluctuating service demands; and general lack of suitable alternatives\\nfor service delivery.\\n  2. The human services delivery system in rural areas is often\\nfragmented, consisting of isolated providers with limited financial\\nresources and limited information-sharing networks. Many such providers\\nare currently providing identical or similar services to the same\\nclientele in the same area, often without being aware of a possible\\nduplication of effort.\\n  3. A full range of coordinated and integrated human services is vital\\nto the health and well-being of residents of rural areas of the state\\nwho are or may in the future be confronted with such intense social\\nproblems as domestic violence, teenage pregnancy, migrant health\\nproblems, nutritional deficiencies, suicide, hunger, unemployment, lack\\nof suitable shelter, crime, drug and alcohol abuse and poverty.\\n  4. A proper response to intense social problems in some rural areas\\nwould be to encourage greater sharing of information and resources among\\nhuman services providers in such rural areas, thereby enhancing the\\ncost-effectiveness and delivery of services required to address such\\nsocial problems.  Such cooperative undertakings could be accomplished if\\na program of financial incentives and state-level technical assistance\\nwere made available to encourage providers in rural areas to embark upon\\nsuch cooperative arrangements and networking of the services they\\nprovide.\\n",

The commissioner is authorized to\\nestablish within the department a rural human services networking\\nprogram, for the purpose of assisting human services providers in rural\\nareas who seek to participate in the program as hereinafter provided, to\\ndevelop pilot projects to address intense social problems through the\\ncreation of contracts or joint or cooperative agreements.  Such pilot\\nprojects shall capitalize on the strength of existing providers by\\npromoting the sharing of resources and service delivery in rural areas,\\nwith the goal of reducing total cost to both consumers and providers\\nwhile increasing the availability and accessibility of human services in\\nsuch areas. Pilot projects shall also serve to identify methods of\\novercoming impediments to the joint provision of integrated and\\ncost-effective human services in rural areas.\\n  2. Within one hundred twenty days after the effective date of this\\narticle, the commissioner, with the advice and guidance of the advisory\\ncommittee, shall establish and give public notice of the existence of\\nthe rural human services networking program, and the availability of\\ncompetitive grants to human services providers interested in undertaking\\npilot projects pursuant to the provisions of this article. At that time\\nthe commissioner shall also distribute information on such program, and\\napplication forms and procedures to eligible human services providers.\\n  3. In order to implement the rural human services networking program\\nthe commissioner shall, within the amounts appropriated therefor,\\nprovide grants to eligible applicants on a competitive basis. No grant\\nfor a pilot project shall be awarded by the commissioner unless the\\napplication for such grant has been reviewed by state agencies which\\nlicense or certify the applicant agencies and any comments on such\\nproposals are considered by the commissioner. To be eligible for a grant\\nunder this article, each application shall be submitted pursuant to a\\ncontract or joint or cooperative agreement on behalf of two or more\\nlocal or regional human services providers intending to implement a\\npilot project in a rural area. Applications shall be submitted to the\\ncommissioner on such forms and at such times as the commissioner shall\\nprescribe, and completed applications shall be approved or disapproved\\nwithin ninety days of submission. In the event the commissioner\\ndetermines that a grant application is incomplete, or where waivers of\\nany regulations are requested by an applicant, the commissioner shall\\nhave an additional ninety days to act upon such application.\\n  4. In determining whether an application shall be approved and funds\\nawarded pursuant to this article, the commissioner shall give priority\\nconsideration to applications received from human services providers\\nintending to implement a pilot project in the most sparsely populated\\nrural areas, as shall be previously determined by the commissioner, in\\nconjunction with the advisory committee. In addition, the commissioner\\nshall consider, but such consideration shall not be limited to, the\\nfollowing:\\n  a. The specific objectives and description of the proposed pilot\\nproject, including demonstrated awareness of the level of human services\\ncurrently being provided within the service area;\\n  b. The degree to which the proposed pilot project would meet local or\\nregional human services needs;\\n  c. The demonstrated ability of the applicants to undertake the pilot\\nproject;\\n  d. The contribution the project would make toward the identification\\nand development of innovative delivery systems;\\n  e. The degree to which the proposal would enhance the delivery or\\nimprove the availability and accessibility of services with respect to\\nthe full continuum of human services needs;\\n  f. The degree to which continuity of care would be fostered and\\nimproved;\\n  g. The degree to which the proposal would enhance cost efficiency and\\naccess to human services by populations in need of such services;\\n  h. The degree to which information sharing, communication, and\\ncooperation between providers and consumers would be fostered;\\n  i. The degree to which economies of scale in both the supply and\\ndemand of services would be addressed;\\n  j. The demonstrated level of commitment and support for the project\\nexpressed by the community, local government body or bodies, and other\\nlocal or regional human services providers;\\n  k. The impact the proposed pilot project will have on state agencies\\nproviding services or funds for human services programs in the area, as\\ndetermined by the commissioner after consulting with such agencies;\\n  l. The consistency of the proposed pilot project with the provisions\\nof article forty-one of the mental hygiene law; and\\n  m. Any potential loss of funds or state or federal aid to which\\nproviders may now be entitled, including but not limited to medicaid\\nfunds, and the actions to be taken by the applicant and by the\\ncommissioner to ensure the continuation of the same amount of funds or\\naid.\\n  5. The commissioner or his or her duly authorized representative may\\nmeet with representatives of the applicants for the informal discussion\\nof preliminary and informal plans for a proposed project and may provide\\nsuch technical assistance as may be requested to implement an approved\\nproject.\\n  6. Pilot projects shall be approved for a time period not to exceed\\nthree years. Within the amounts appropriated therefor, the commissioner\\nshall approve pilot project grant awards of not less than ten thousand\\ndollars nor more than fifty thousand dollars per pilot project in any\\none calendar year. Such grants may be renewed annually for up to three\\nconsecutive years, subject to the availability of funds. Funds awarded\\nto each recipient in the second and third years may be the same amount\\nas the grant received in the first year, or may be a lesser amount, with\\nthe amounts of such awards determined in accordance with the nature of\\nthe approved pilot project, the number of delivery and consumer\\nagencies, and the number of clients to be served. If the commissioner\\ndetermines that a grant is being used for purposes other than those\\nwhich are in conformity with this article, the commissioner may withdraw\\napproval of the project and require repayment of all or part of such\\ngrant to the state. The commissioner shall cause reports to be prepared\\nand submitted for each project by the grantees at such times and in such\\nmanner as are consistent with the purposes of this article.\\n  7. For the purpose of promoting innovative approaches and maximum\\neffectiveness in the utilization of state and local monies, and\\nnotwithstanding any other provisions of law, the commissioner may waive\\nany departmental regulations that may impede the successful\\nimplementation and testing of a pilot project, provided that there is a\\nfinding by the commissioner that the general welfare of the people\\nreceiving human services will not be impaired. In addition, the\\ncommissioner shall consult with federal, state, and local officials with\\nrespect to securing their cooperation in coordinating related programs\\nand in seeking necessary regulatory waivers, in order to assure the\\neffective operation of any pilot project.  Notwithstanding any other\\nprovisions of law, at the request of the commissioner, on behalf of an\\napplicant, the commissioner or director of any other state agency or\\ndepartment shall be authorized to waive any applicable regulations of\\nsuch agency or department that may impede the successful implementation\\nof a pilot project, provided there is a finding that the general welfare\\nof the people receiving human services will not be impaired.\\n  8. Upon the request of an applicant, the commissioner or his or her\\nduly authorized representative may render to such applicant such\\ntechnical services and assistance as the department may possess or as\\nmay be available to it in order to enable the applicant to carry out the\\nproject and terms of such contract.\\n",

In addition to services provided by\\nsocial services officials pursuant to other provisions of this chapter,\\nsuch officials shall provide protective services in accordance with\\nfederal and state regulations to or for individuals without regard to\\nincome who, because of mental or physical impairments, are unable to\\nmanage their own resources, carry out the activities of daily living, or\\nprotect themselves from physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse,\\nactive, passive or self neglect, financial exploitation or other\\nhazardous situations without assistance from others and have no one\\navailable who is willing and able to assist them responsibly. Such\\nservices shall include:\\n  (a) receiving and investigating reports of seriously impaired\\nindividuals who may be in need of protection;\\n  (b) arranging for medical and psychiatric services to evaluate and\\nwhenever possible to safeguard and improve the circumstances of those\\nwith serious impairments;\\n  (c) arranging, when necessary, for commitment, guardianship, or other\\nprotective placement of such individuals either directly or through\\nreferral to another appropriate agency, provided, however, that where\\npossible, the least restrictive of these measures shall be employed\\nbefore more restrictive controls are imposed;\\n  (d) providing services to assist such individuals to move from\\nsituations which are, or are likely to become, hazardous to their health\\nand well-being;\\n  (e) cooperating and planning with the courts as necessary on behalf of\\nindividuals with serious mental impairments; and\\n  (f) other protective services for adults included in the regulations\\nof the department.\\n  2. (a) In that the effective delivery of protective services for\\nadults requires a network of professional consultants and services\\nproviders, local social services districts shall plan with other public,\\nprivate and voluntary agencies including but not limited to health,\\nmental health, aging, legal and law enforcement agencies, for the\\npurpose of assuring maximum local understanding, coordination and\\ncooperative action in the provision of appropriate services.\\n  (b) Each social services district shall prepare, with the approval of\\nthe chief executive officer, or the legislative body in those counties\\nwithout a chief executive officer, after consultation with appropriate\\npublic, private and voluntary agencies, a district-wide plan for the\\nprovision of adult protective services which shall be a component of the\\ndistrict's multi-year consolidated services plan as required in section\\nthirty-four-a of this chapter. This plan shall describe the local\\nimplementation of this section including the organization, staffing,\\nmode of operations and financing of the adult protective services as\\nwell as the provisions made for purchase of services, inter-agency\\nrelations, inter-agency agreements, service referral mechanisms, and\\nlocus of responsibility for cases with multi-agency services needs.\\nCommencing the year following preparation of a multi-year consolidated\\nservices plan, each local district shall prepare annual implementation\\nreports including information related to its adult protective services\\nplan as required in section thirty-four-a of the social services law.\\n  (c) Each social services district shall submit the adult protective\\nservices plan to the department as a component of its multi-year\\nconsolidated services plan and subsequent thereto as a component of its\\nannual implementation reports and the department shall review and\\napprove the proposed plan and reports in accordance with the procedures\\nset forth in section thirty-four-a of this chapter.\\n  3. Any social services official or his designee authorized or required\\nto determine the need for and/or provide or arrange for the provision of\\nprotective services to adults in accordance with the provision of this\\nsection, shall have immunity from any civil liability that might\\notherwise result by reason of providing such services, provided such\\nofficial or his designee was acting in the discharge of his duties and\\nwithin the scope of his employment, and that such liability did not\\nresult from the willfull act or gross negligence of such official or his\\ndesignee.\\n  4. For the purpose of developing improved methods for the delivery of\\nprotective services for adults, the department with the approval of the\\ndirector of the budget, shall authorize a maximum of five demonstration\\nprojects in selected social services districts. Such projects may serve\\na social services district, part of a district or more than one\\ndistrict. These demonstration projects shall seek to determine the most\\neffective methods of providing the financial management component of\\nprotective services for adults. These methods shall include but not be\\nlimited to: having a social services district directly provide financial\\nmanagement services; having a social services district contract with\\nanother public and/or private agency for the provision of such services;\\nutilizing relatives and/or friends to provide such services under the\\ndirection of a social services district or another public and/or private\\nagency and establishing a separate public office to provide financial\\nmanagement services for indigent persons. The duration of these projects\\nshall not exceed eighteen months. Furthermore, local social services\\ndistricts shall not be responsible for any part of the cost of these\\ndemonstration projects which would not have otherwise accrued in the\\nprovision of protective services for adults. The total amount of state\\nfunds available for such financial management services demonstration\\nprojects, exclusive of any federal funds shall not exceed three hundred\\nthousand dollars. The commissioner shall require that a final\\nindependent evaluation by a not-for-profit corporation be made of the\\ndemonstration projects approved and conducted hereunder, and shall\\nprovide copies of such report to the governor and the legislature.\\n  5. Whenever a social services official, or his or her designee\\nauthorized or required to determine the need for, or to provide or\\narrange for the provision of protective services to adults in accordance\\nwith the provisions of this title has a reason to believe that a\\ncriminal offense has been committed, as defined in the penal law,\\nagainst a person for whom the need for such services is being determined\\nor to whom such services are being provided or arranged, the social\\nservices official or his or her designee must report this information to\\nthe appropriate police or sheriff's department and the district\\nattorney's office when such office has requested such information be\\nreported by a social services official or his or her designee.\\n  6.

              "text" : "  § 481-a. Legislative findings and purpose. For the past decade,\\nsociety has witnessed broad changes in family structure. These changes\\nhave created unique stresses on our children as well as on those who\\ncare for them. Among the most dire results of family stresses is the\\nincreasing frequency of child abuse and maltreatment, represented by a\\nsteady increase in reports of abuse and maltreatment to the statewide\\ncentral register of child abuse and maltreatment.  Additionally nearly\\none-fifth of homicides, and an even larger proportion of assaults occur\\nwithin the home between members of families. Among the contributing\\ncauses of family violence are economic stress, social isolation, drug\\nand alcohol abuse, parental attitude regarding discipline and child\\nrearing, as well as acceptance of violence as a way of life. The\\nreported incidents of both adult domestic violence and child abuse and\\nmaltreatment ( including intergenerational family violence) represent\\nonly a portion of the total number of incidents in the pervasive and\\npersistent problem of family violence. The development and support of\\nprevention programs for child abuse and maltreatment and domestic\\nviolence (including intergenerational family violence) and services to\\nvictims of family violence is, therefore, of major importance to the\\nstate.\\n  It is the intent of the legislature that the funds for the William B.\\nHoyt Memorial children and family trust fund shall be a new source of\\nfunding which shall increase the funds available for prevention and\\ntreatment services to victims of family violence. The legislature does\\nnot intend that these funds be used as a substitute for any funds\\ncurrently available from federal, state or local sources for the\\nprovision of prevention or treatment services to these victims.\\n",

The legislature finds that\\npublic policy experts and state and local agencies have been searching\\nfor a model of service delivery that will insure programmatically\\neffective and cost-efficient delivery of services to inner-city families\\nand neighborhoods, and that the emerging consensus is that the best\\nmodels provide comprehensive, coordinated, neighborhood-based and\\nfamily-focused services. The legislature further finds that New York\\nstate's existing network of fifty-eight settlement houses can contribute\\nto providing these comprehensive, coordinated, neighborhood-based and\\nfamily-focused services in a cost-effective manner, and that the\\ncapacity of these settlement houses to provide and enhance these\\nservices can be increased if the settlement houses are provided with\\nadditional resources to implement greater neighborhood outreach, to\\ndirect individuals and family members to appropriate settlement and\\ncommunity-based resources, to monitor the progress of these individuals,\\nand to plan and coordinate intra-agency and community services so that\\ncommunity residents have easy access to a range of services that respond\\nto the varied and often multiple needs of individuals and families.\\n  It is the intent of the legislature to increase the funds available to\\nsettlement houses for the purpose of providing a comprehensive range of\\nservices to the residents of the neighborhoods they serve, and that\\nfunds provided pursuant to this article will be complemented by\\nprivately-raised contributions to the settlement-houses for the program\\nservices funded pursuant to this article.

The justice center may take additional time to enter\\nsuch findings into the vulnerable persons' central register; provided,\\nhowever, that the reasons for any delay must be documented and such\\nfindings submitted as soon thereafter as practicably possible.\\n  2. For substantiated reports of abuse or neglect in facilities or\\nprovider agencies in receipt of medical assistance, such information\\nshall also be forwarded by the justice center to the office of the\\nMedicaid inspector general when such abuse or neglect may be relevant to\\nan investigation of unacceptable practices as such practices are defined\\nin regulations of the office of the Medicaid inspector general.\\n  3. (a) A finding shall be based on a preponderance of the evidence and\\nshall indicate whether: (i) the alleged abuse or neglect is\\nsubstantiated because it is determined that the incident occurred and\\nthe subject of the report was responsible or, if no subject can be\\nidentified and an incident occurred, that, the facility or provider\\nagency was responsible; or (ii) the alleged abuse or neglect is\\nunsubstantiated because it is determined not to have occurred or the\\nsubject of the report was not responsible, or because it cannot be\\ndetermined that the incident occurred or that the subject of the report\\nwas responsible. A report shall not be determined to be substantiated or\\nunsubstantiated solely because the subject of a report resigns during an\\ninvestigation.\\n  (b) In conjunction with the possible findings identified in paragraph\\n(a) of this subdivision, a concurrent finding may be made that a\\nsystemic problem caused or contributed to the occurrence of the\\nincident.\\n  (c) The justice center shall notify the subject of the report, the\\nfacility or provider agency where the abuse or neglect was alleged to\\nhave occurred, the applicable state oversight agency and other persons\\nnamed in the report, which includes the service recipient's parent,\\nguardian or other person legally responsible for such person, of the\\nfindings of the investigation and, as applicable, the local social\\nservices commissioner or school district that placed the individual in\\nthe facility or provider agency, the office of children and family\\nservices and any attorney for the individual whose appointment has been\\ncontinued by a family court judge during the term of an individual's\\nplacement, in accordance with applicable state and federal laws and\\nregulations governing the use and disclosure of records.

(a) Category one findings shall result in permanent placement of\\nthe subject of the report on the vulnerable persons' central register in\\naccordance with section four hundred ninety-five of this article.\\n  (b) Except when a custodian has a category two finding elevated to a\\ncategory one finding pursuant to this section, a custodian with a\\ncategory two finding shall be subject to progressive discipline. (For\\nstate entities bound by collective bargaining, such discipline\\nestablished by collective bargaining shall govern.) In conjunction with\\nsuch disciplinary action, the facility or provider agency shall develop\\na plan for training and any other actions to reduce the risk of\\nrecurrence of such conduct. Such plan must be approved by and its\\nimplementation monitored by the justice center or the state oversight\\nagency, as appropriate.\\n  (c) With respect to a category three or four finding, the justice\\ncenter shall require the facility or provider agency to develop and\\nimplement a plan of prevention and remediation of the deficient\\nconditions.
