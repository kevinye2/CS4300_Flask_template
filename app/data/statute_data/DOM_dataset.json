To see whether you are\\nsusceptible to rubella, you can get a blood test from your doctor. Even\\nmore important is the availability of a rubella vaccine which will\\nprevent you from ever contracting the disease.\\n  In order to protect yourself, your family, and your friends, please\\ntake steps to prevent the tragic effects of rubella.

From party one: Full\\nname, place of residence, social security number, age, occupation, place\\nof birth, name of father, country of birth, maiden name of mother,\\ncountry of birth, number of marriage. From party two: Full name, place\\nof residence, social security number, age, occupation, place of birth,\\nname of father, country of birth, maiden name of mother, country of\\nbirth, number of marriage. Both parties shall also be required to\\npresent to the clerk documentary proof of age in the form of an original\\nor certified copy of a birth record, a certification of birth issued by\\nthe state department of health, a local registrar of vital statistics or\\nother public officer charged with similar duties by the laws of any\\nother state, territory or country, a baptismal record, a passport, an\\nautomobile driver's license, any government or school issued\\nidentification card that contains a photograph of the applicant, a life\\ninsurance policy, an employment certificate, a school record, an\\nimmigration record, a naturalization record, a court record or any other\\ndocument or record issued by a governmental entity, showing the date of\\nbirth of such parties. The said clerk shall also embody in the statement\\nif either or both of the applicants have been previously married, a\\nstatement as to whether the former spouse or spouses of the respective\\napplicants are living or dead and as to whether either or both of said\\napplicants are divorced persons, if so, when and where and against whom\\nthe divorce or divorces were granted and shall also embody therein a\\nstatement that no legal impediment exists as to the right of each of the\\napplicants to enter into the marriage state. The town or city clerk is\\nhereby given full power and authority to administer oaths and may\\nrequire the applicants to produce witnesses to identify them or either\\nof them and may examine under oath or otherwise other witnesses as to\\nany material inquiry pertaining to the issuing of the license, and if\\nthe applicant is a divorced person the clerk may also require the\\nproduction of a certified copy of the decree of the divorce, or proof of\\nan existing marriage of parties who apply for a license to be used for a\\nsecond or subsequent ceremony; provided, however, that in cities or\\ntowns the verified statements and affidavits may be made before any\\nregular clerk or designee of the clerk's office.\\n  (b) Every application for a marriage license shall contain a statement\\nto the following effect:\\n                          NOTICE TO APPLICANTS\\n  (1) Every person has the right to adopt any name by which he or she\\nwishes to be known simply by using that name consistently and without\\nintent to defraud.\\n  (2) A person's last name (surname) does not automatically change upon\\nmarriage, and neither party to the marriage must change his or her last\\nname. Parties to a marriage need not have the same last name.\\n  (3) One or both parties to a marriage may elect to change the surname\\nby which he or she wishes to be known after the solemnization of the\\nmarriage by entering the new name in the space below. Such entry shall\\nconsist of one of the following surnames:\\n  (i) the surname of the other spouse; or\\n  (ii) any former surname of either spouse; or\\n  (iii) a name combining into a single surname all or a segment of the\\npremarriage surname or any former surname of each spouse; or\\n  (iv) a combination name separated by a hyphen or space, provided that\\neach part of such combination surname is the premarriage surname, or any\\nformer surname, of each of the spouses.\\n  (4) One or both parties to a marriage may elect to change the middle\\nname by which he or she wishes to be known after the solemnization of\\nthe marriage by entering the new name in the space below. Such entry\\nshall consist of one of the following options:\\n  (i) the current surname of the spouse electing to change his or her\\nname; or\\n  (ii) any former surname of the spouse electing to change his or her\\nname; or\\n  (iii) the surname of the other spouse.\\n  (5) The use of this option will have the effect of providing a record\\nof the change of name. The marriage certificate, containing the new\\nname, if any, constitutes proof that the use of the new name, or the\\nretention of the former name, is lawful.\\n  (6) Neither the use of, nor the failure to use, this option of\\nselecting a new surname or middle name by means of this application\\nabrogates the right of each person to adopt a different name through\\nusage at some future date.\\n                  .....................................\\n                  (Optional -- Enter new surname above)\\n  2. If it appears from the affidavits and statements so taken, and from\\nthe documentary proof of age presented, that the persons for whose\\nmarriage the license in question is demanded are legally competent to\\nmarry, the said clerk shall issue such license.\\n  3. If it shall appear upon an application of the applicants as\\nprovided in this section or upon information required by the clerk that\\neither party is at least seventeen years of age but under eighteen years\\nof age, then the town or city clerk before he shall issue a license\\nshall require:\\n  (a) the written consent to the marriage from both parents of the minor\\nor minors or such as shall then be living, or if the parents of both are\\ndead, then the written consent of the guardian or guardians of such\\nminor or minors. If one of the parents has been missing and has not been\\nseen or heard from for a period of one year preceding the time of the\\napplication for the license, although diligent inquiry has been made to\\nlearn the whereabouts of such parent, the town or city clerk may issue a\\nlicense to such minor upon the sworn statement and consent of the other\\nparent. If the marriage of the parents of such minor has been dissolved\\nby decree of divorce or annulment, the consent of the parent to whom the\\ncourt which granted the decree has awarded the custody of such minor\\nshall be sufficient. If there is no parent or guardian of the minor or\\nminors living to their knowledge then the town or city clerk shall\\nrequire the written consent to the marriage of the person under whose\\ncare or government the minor or minors may be before a license shall be\\nissued. If a parent of such minor has been adjudicated an incompetent,\\nthe town or city clerk may issue a license to such minor upon the\\nproduction of a certified copy of such judgment so determining and upon\\nthe written consent of the other parent. If there is no other parent\\nwhose consent is required by this section, then and in such event, the\\ntown or city clerk shall require the written consent of the guardian of\\nsuch minor or of the person under whose care or government the minor may\\nbe before a license shall be issued. The parents, guardians, or other\\npersons whose consent it shall be necessary to obtain and file with the\\ntown or city clerk before the license shall issue, shall personally\\nappear and acknowledge or execute the same before the town or city\\nclerk, or some other officer authorized to administer oaths and take\\nacknowledgments provided that where such affidavit or acknowledgment is\\nmade before an official other than an officer designated in section two\\nhundred ninety-eight of the real property law as authorized to take such\\naffidavit or acknowledgment if a conveyance of real property were being\\nacknowledged or proved, or if a certificate of authentication would be\\nrequired by section three hundred ten of the real property law to\\nentitle the instrument to be recorded if it were a conveyance of real\\nproperty, the consent when filed must have attached thereto a\\ncertificate of authentication; and\\n  (b) the written approval of a justice of the supreme court or of a\\njudge of the family court, having jurisdiction over the town or city in\\nwhich the application is made, to be attached to or endorsed upon the\\napplication, before the license is issued. The application for such\\napproval may be made by either minor party to the proposed marriage and\\nshall be heard by the judge at chambers. The justice of the supreme\\ncourt or the judge of the family court shall appoint an attorney for the\\nchild for each minor party immediately upon the application for\\napproval. The attorney for the child must have received training in\\ndomestic violence including a component on forced marriage. All papers\\nand records pertaining to any such application shall be sealed and\\nwithheld from inspection, except by order of a court of competent\\njurisdiction. Before issuing any approval, the justice of the supreme\\ncourt or the judge of the family court shall:\\n  (i) provide notification to each minor party of his or her rights,\\nincluding but not limited to, rights in relation to termination of the\\nmarriage, child and spousal support, domestic violence services and\\naccess to public benefits and other services, which notification shall\\nbe developed by the office of court administration, in consultation with\\nthe office for the prevention of domestic violence;\\n  (ii) with respect to each party, including a minor party, conduct a\\nreview of related decisions in court proceedings initiated pursuant to\\narticle ten of the family court act, and all warrants issued under the\\nfamily court act, and reports of the statewide computerized registry of\\norders of protection established and maintained pursuant to section two\\nhundred twenty-one-a of the executive law, and reports of the sex\\noffender registry established and maintained pursuant to section one\\nhundred sixty-eight-b of the correction law; and\\n  (iii) have an in camera interview, separately with each minor party,\\nand make the following written affirmative findings:\\n  A. that it is the minor's own will that the minor enter into the\\nmarriage;\\n  B. that the minor is not being compelled by force, threat, persuasion,\\nfraud, coercion or duress; and\\n  C. that the marriage will not endanger the mental, emotional or\\nphysical safety of the minor.\\n  In making such findings, the court shall consider, among other\\nrelevant factors, the age difference between the parties intending to be\\nmarried, whether there is a power imbalance between the parties\\nintending to be married, whether the parties are incapable of consenting\\nto a marriage for want of understanding, whether there is a history of\\ndomestic violence between the parties and whether there is a history of\\ndomestic violence between a party and either parties' or legal\\nguardians' family members.

Any adjournment for extraordinary circumstances\\nshall be for not more than three court days. The application for the\\nwarrant must include the statements required by subdivision two of\\nsection seventy-seven-g of this title.\\n  3. A warrant to take physical custody of a child must:\\n  (a) recite the facts upon which a conclusion of imminent serious\\nphysical harm or removal from the jurisdiction is based;\\n  (b) direct law enforcement officers to take physical custody of the\\nchild immediately and deliver the child to the petitioner or, where\\nnecessary, to act jointly with the local child protective service to\\ntake immediate steps to protect the child; and\\n  (c) provide for the placement of the child pending final relief.\\n  4. The respondent must be served with the petition, warrant, and order\\nimmediately after the child is taken into physical custody.\\n  5. A warrant to take physical custody of a child is enforceable\\nthroughout this state. If the court finds on the basis of the testimony\\nof the petitioner or other witness that a less intrusive remedy is not\\neffective, it may authorize law enforcement officers to enter private\\nproperty in order to execute the warrant and take physical custody of\\nthe child. If required by exigent circumstances of the case and\\nnecessary to the protection of the child, the court may authorize law\\nenforcement officers to make a forcible entry at any hour.\\n  6. The court may impose conditions upon placement of a child to ensure\\nthe appearance of the child and the child's custodian.\\n",

A person appointed guardian in pursuance of this section\\nshall not exercise the power of authority thereof unless such will is\\nadmitted to probate, or such deed executed and recorded as provided by\\nSCPA 1710.\\n",

Subject to the limitations\\nhereinafter set forth consent to adoption shall be required as follows:\\n  (a) Of the adoptive child, if over fourteen years of age, unless the\\njudge or surrogate in his discretion dispenses with such consent;\\n  (b) Of the parents or surviving parent, whether adult or infant, of a\\nchild conceived or born in wedlock;\\n  (c) Of the mother, whether adult or infant, of a child born out of\\nwedlock;\\n  (d) Of the father, whether adult or infant, of a child born\\nout-of-wedlock and placed with the adoptive parents more than six months\\nafter birth, but only if such father shall have maintained substantial\\nand continuous or repeated contact with the child as manifested by: (i)\\nthe payment by the father toward the support of the child of a fair and\\nreasonable sum, according to the father's means, and either (ii) the\\nfather's visiting the child at least monthly when physically and\\nfinancially able to do so and not prevented from doing so by the person\\nor authorized agency having lawful custody of the child, or (iii) the\\nfather's regular communication with the child or with the person or\\nagency having the care or custody of the child, when physically and\\nfinancially unable to visit the child or prevented from doing so by the\\nperson or authorized agency having lawful custody of the child. The\\nsubjective intent of the father, whether expressed or otherwise,\\nunsupported by evidence of acts specified in this paragraph manifesting\\nsuch intent, shall not preclude a determination that the father failed\\nto maintain substantial and continuous or repeated contact with the\\nchild. In making such a determination, the court shall not require a\\nshowing of diligent efforts by any person or agency to encourage the\\nfather to perform the acts specified in this paragraph. A father,\\nwhether adult or infant, of a child born out-of-wedlock, who openly\\nlived with the child for a period of six months within the one year\\nperiod immediately preceding the placement of the child for adoption and\\nwho during such period openly held himself out to be the father of such\\nchild shall be deemed to have maintained substantial and continuous\\ncontact with the child for the purpose of this subdivision.\\n  (e) Of the father, whether adult or infant, of a child born\\nout-of-wedlock who is under the age of six months at the time he is\\nplaced for adoption, but only if: (i) such father openly lived with the\\nchild or the child's mother for a continuous period of six months\\nimmediately preceding the placement of the child for adoption; and (ii)\\nsuch father openly held himself out to be the father of such child\\nduring such period; and (iii) such father paid a fair and reasonable\\nsum, in accordance with his means, for the medical, hospital and nursing\\nexpenses incurred in connection with the mother's pregnancy or with the\\nbirth of the child.\\n  (f) Of any person or authorized agency having lawful custody of the\\nadoptive child.\\n  2. The consent shall not be required of a parent or of any other\\nperson having custody of the child:\\n  (a) who evinces an intent to forego his or her parental or custodial\\nrights and obligations as manifested by his or her failure for a period\\nof six months to visit the child and communicate with the child or\\nperson having legal custody of the child, although able to do so; or\\n  (b) who has surrendered the child to an authorized agency under the\\nprovisions of section three hundred eighty-three-c or three hundred\\neighty-four of the social services law; or\\n  (c) for whose child a guardian has been appointed under the provisions\\nof section three hundred eighty-four-b of the social services law; or\\n  (d) who, by reason of mental illness or intellectual disability, as\\ndefined in subdivision six of section three hundred eighty-four-b of the\\nsocial services law, is presently and for the foreseeable future unable\\nto provide proper care for the child. The determination as to whether a\\nparent is mentally ill or intellectually disabled shall be made in\\naccordance with the criteria and procedures set forth in subdivision six\\nof section three hundred eighty-four-b of the social services law; or\\n  (e) who has executed an instrument, which shall be irrevocable,\\ndenying the paternity of the child, such instrument having been executed\\nafter conception and acknowledged or proved in the manner required to\\npermit the recording of a deed.\\n  3. (a) Notice of the proposed adoption shall be given to a person\\nwhose consent to adoption is required pursuant to subdivision one and\\nwho has not already provided such consent.\\n  (b) Notice and an opportunity to be heard upon the proposed adoption\\nmay be afforded to a parent whose consent to adoption may not be\\nrequired pursuant to subdivision two, if the judge or surrogate so\\norders.\\n  (c) Notice under this subdivision shall be given in such manner as the\\njudge or surrogate may direct.\\n  (d) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, neither the notice of\\na proposed adoption nor any process in such proceeding shall be required\\nto contain the name of the person or persons seeking to adopt the child.\\n  4. Where the adoptive child is over the age of eighteen years the\\nconsents specified in paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) of subdivision one of\\nthis section shall not be required, and the judge or surrogate in his\\ndiscretion may direct that the consent specified in paragraph (f) of\\nsubdivision one of this section shall not be required if in his opinion\\nthe best interests of the adoptive child will be promoted by the\\nadoption and such consent cannot for any reason be obtained.\\n  5. An adoptive child who has once been lawfully adopted may be\\nreadopted directly from such child's adoptive parents in the same manner\\nas from its birth parents. In such case the consent of such birth\\nparents shall not be required but the judge or surrogate in his\\ndiscretion may require that notice be given to the birth parents in such\\nmanner as he may prescribe.\\n  6. For the purposes of paragraph (a) of subdivision two:\\n  (a) In the absence of evidence to the contrary, the ability to visit\\nand communicate with a child or person having custody of the child shall\\nbe presumed.\\n  (b) Evidence of insubstantial or infrequent visits or communication by\\nthe parent or other person having custody of the child shall not, of\\nitself, be sufficient as a matter of law to preclude a finding that the\\nconsent of such parent or person to the child's adoption shall not be\\nrequired.\\n  (c) The subjective intent of the parent or other person having custody\\nof the child, whether expressed or otherwise, unsupported by evidence of\\nacts specified in paragraph (a) of subdivision two manifesting such\\nintent, shall not preclude a determination that the consent of such\\nparent or other person to the child's adoption shall not be required.\\n  (d) Payment by a parent toward the support of the child of a fair and\\nreasonable sum, according to the parent's means, shall be deemed a\\nsubstantial communication by such parent with the child or person having\\nlegal custody of the child.\\n",

The adoptive parents or parent and the adoptive child if over\\neighteen years of age must present to such judge or surrogate (a) a\\npetition stating the names and place of residence of the petitioners;\\nwhether they are of full age; whether they are married or unmarried and,\\nif married, whether they are living together as husband and wife; the\\nfirst name, date and place of birth of the adoptive child as nearly as\\nthe same can be ascertained; a statement on information and belief that\\nthere will be annexed to the petition a schedule verified by a duly\\nconstituted official of the authorized agency as required by this\\nsection; the religious faith of the petitioners; the religious faith of\\nthe adoptive child and his or her parents as nearly as the same can be\\nascertained; the manner in which the adoptive parents obtained the\\nadoptive child; whether the child was placed or brought into the state\\nof New York from out of state for the purpose of adoption, whether the\\nplacement was subject to the provisions of section three hundred\\nseventy-four-a of the social services law and if the placement was\\nsubject to the provisions of such section, whether the provisions of\\nsuch section were complied with; the period of time during which the\\nadoptive child has resided with the adoptive parents; the occupation and\\napproximate income of the petitioners, including support and\\nmaintenance, if any, to be received on behalf of the adoptive child from\\na commissioner of social services, pursuant to the social services law,\\nand the new name, if any, by which the adoptive child is to be known;\\nwhether the adoptive parent or parents has or have knowledge that an\\nadoptive parent is the subject of an indicated report, as such terms are\\ndefined in section four hundred twelve of the social services law, filed\\nwith the statewide central register of child abuse and maltreatment\\npursuant to title six of article six of the social services law, or has\\nbeen the subject of or the respondent in a child protective proceeding\\ncommenced under article ten of the family court act, which proceeding\\nresulted in an order finding that the child is an abused or neglected\\nchild; that no previous application has been made to any court or judge\\nfor the relief sought or if so made, the disposition of it and a\\nstatement as to whether the adoptive child had been previously adopted,\\nall of which statements shall be taken prima facie as true; (b) an\\nagreement on the part of the adoptive parents or parent to adopt and\\ntreat the adoptive child as their or his or her own lawful child; (c)\\nthe consents required by section one hundred eleven of this article.\\n  2-a. In the petition provided for in subdivision two of this section,\\nthe adoptive parents or parent and the adoptive child if over eighteen\\nyears of age shall present to the judge or surrogate as nearly as can be\\nascertained the heritage of the parents, which shall include\\nnationality, ethnic background and race; education, which shall be the\\nnumber of years of school completed by the parents at the time of the\\nbirth of the adoptive child; general physical appearance of the parents\\nat the time of the birth of the adoptive child, which shall include\\nheight, weight, color of hair, eyes, skin; occupation of the parents at\\nthe time of the birth of the adoptive child; health and medical history\\nof the parents at the time of the birth of the adoptive child, including\\nall available information setting forth conditions or diseases believed\\nto be hereditary, any drugs or medication taken during the pregnancy by\\nthe child's mother; and any other information which may be a factor\\ninfluencing the child's present or future health, talents, hobbies and\\nspecial interests of parents.

When the adoptive\\nparents are the foster parents in whose home the adoptive child has been\\nplaced out or boarded out for a period in excess of three months, such\\nperiod shall be deemed to constitute the required period of residence.\\n  7. Before making an order of adoption the judge or surrogate shall\\ninquire of the department of social services and the department shall\\ninform the court whether an adoptive parent is the subject of an\\nindicated report, as such terms are defined in section four hundred\\ntwelve of the social services law, filed with the statewide central\\nregister of child abuse and maltreatment pursuant to title six of\\narticle six of the social services law and shall cause to be made an\\ninvestigation by a disinterested person or by an authorized agency\\nspecifically designated by the judge or surrogate to examine into the\\nallegations set forth in the petition and to ascertain such other facts\\nrelating to the adoptive child and adoptive parents as will give such\\njudge or surrogate adequate basis for determining the propriety of\\napproving the adoption. A written report of such investigation shall be\\nsubmitted before the order of adoption is made. As used in this\\nsubdivision, \"disinterested person\" includes the probation service of\\nthe family court. Such an inquiry shall not be required if the findings\\nof such an inquiry made within the past twelve months is available to\\nthe judge or surrogate.\\n  7-a. Any order subject to the provisions of this section shall include\\nan adoption information registry birth parent registration consent form,\\nstating whether or not such biological parent or parents whose consent\\nis subject to the provisions of this section, consents to the receipt of\\nidentifying information by the child to be adopted upon registration\\nwith the adoption information registry established by section forty-one\\nhundred thirty-eight-c of the public health law and upon the adoptee\\nreaching the age of eighteen. If such consent is made, it shall be\\nrevocable by either of the biological parents at any time. The\\nrevocation of the consent by one of the parents shall revoke the consent\\nof both parents. The failure of a biological parent to complete the\\nconsent form shall have no effect on the finality of the consent to\\nadoption. A copy of the form required by this subdivision, shall be\\nforwarded to the state adoption information registry for inclusion in\\nthe records maintained by such registry. Any fees authorized to be\\ncharged by the state adoption registry for filing documentation with\\nsuch registry shall be waived for the form required by this subdivision.\\n  8. Rules of court shall permit the filing of a petition for adoption\\nof a child whose custody and guardianship has not yet been committed to\\nan authorized agency where a proceeding to terminate parental rights is\\npending. Such adoption petition shall be filed in the court where the\\ntermination of parental rights proceeding is pending. The clerk of such\\ncourt shall accept the adoption petition for filing and processing and\\nshall request such inquiries of the department of social services as are\\nrequired by subdivision seven of this section, provided, however, that\\nthe petition, supporting documents and the fact of their filing shall\\nnot be provided to the judge before whom the petition for termination of\\nparental rights is pending until such time as fact-finding is concluded\\nunder such petition.\\n",

In accordance with subparagraph three of paragraph (g) of\\nsubdivision six of section three hundred ninety-eight of the social\\nservices law, an authorized agency may submit a written request to a\\nsocial services district with a population of more than two million for\\napproval to consent to the adoption of a child whose custody and\\nguardianship, or of a child where such child's parents are both\\ndeceased, or where one parent is deceased and the other parent is not\\nentitled to notice pursuant to sections one hundred eleven and one\\nhundred eleven-a of this chapter, and whose care and custody, has been\\ntransferred to a social services official and who has been placed by the\\nsocial services official with the authorized agency. If the request is\\nnot disapproved by the social services district within sixty days after\\nits submission, it shall be deemed approved, and the authorized agency\\nmay give all necessary consent to the adoption of the child. Nothing\\nherein shall result in the transfer of care and custody or custody and\\nguardianship of the child from the social services official to the\\nauthorized agency.\\n  3. (a) The agreement of adoption shall be executed by such authorized\\nagency.\\n  (b)(i) If the adoption petition is filed pursuant to subdivision eight\\nof section one hundred twelve of this article or subdivision ten of\\nsection three hundred eighty-three-c or subdivision eleven of section\\nthree hundred eighty-four-b of the social services law, the petition\\nshall be filed in the county where the termination of parental rights\\nproceeding or judicial surrender proceeding, as applicable, is pending\\nand shall be assigned, wherever practicable, to the same judge.\\n  (ii) In any other agency adoption proceeding, the petition shall be\\nfiled in the same court and, wherever practicable, shall be assigned to\\nthe same judge of the county in which parental rights had been\\nterminated, a judicial surrender had been approved or the most recent\\nproceeding under article ten or ten-A of the family court act or section\\nthree hundred fifty-eight-a of the social services law had been heard,\\nwhichever occurred last, or in the county where the adoptive parents\\nreside or, if such adoptive parents do not reside in this state, in the\\ncounty where such authorized agency has its principal office. The\\nfollowing procedures shall be applicable in cases where the child is\\nunder the jurisdiction of a family court, but where the adoption\\npetition has been filed in a court other than the court that presided\\nover the termination of parental rights, surrender or most recent\\nproceeding under article ten or ten-A of the family court act or section\\nthree hundred fifty-eight-a of the social services law, whichever\\noccurred last:\\n  (A) Before hearing such an adoption proceeding, the court in which the\\nadoption petition was filed shall ascertain whether the child is under\\nthe jurisdiction of a family court as a result of a placement under\\narticle ten or ten-A of the family court act or section three hundred\\nfifty-eight-a of the social services law, a surrender under section\\nthree hundred eighty-three-c or three hundred eighty-four of the social\\nservices law or an order committing guardianship and custody under\\narticle six of the family court act or section three hundred\\neighty-four-b of the social services law, and, if so, which court\\nexercised jurisdiction over the most recent permanency or other\\nproceeding involving the child.\\n  (B) If the court determines that the child is under the jurisdiction\\nof a different family court, the court in which the adoption petition\\nwas filed shall stay its proceeding for not more than thirty days and\\nshall communicate with the family court judge who exercised jurisdiction\\nover the most recent permanency or other proceeding involving the child.\\nThe communication shall be recorded or summarized on the record by the\\ncourt in which the adoption petition was filed. Both courts shall notify\\nthe parties and the attorney for the child, if any, in their respective\\nproceedings and shall give them an opportunity to present facts and\\nlegal argument or to participate in the communication prior to the\\nissuance of a decision on jurisdiction.\\n  (C) The family court judge who exercised jurisdiction over the most\\nrecent permanency or other proceeding involving the child shall\\ndetermine whether he or she should assume or decline jurisdiction over\\nthe adoption proceeding. In making its determination, the family court\\njudge shall consider, among other factors: the relative familiarity of\\neach court with the facts and circumstances regarding permanency\\nplanning for, and the needs and best interests of, the child; the\\nability of the attorney for the child to continue such representation in\\nthe adoption proceeding, if appropriate; the convenience of each court\\nto the residence of the prospective adoptive parent or parents; and the\\nrelative ability of each court to hear and determine the adoption\\npetition expeditiously. The court in which the adoption petition was\\nfiled shall issue an order incorporating this determination of\\njurisdiction within thirty days of the filing of the adoption petition.\\n  (D) If the family court that exercised jurisdiction over the most\\nrecent permanency or other proceeding determines that it should exercise\\njurisdiction over the adoption petition, the order of the court in which\\nthe adoption petition was filed shall direct the transfer of the\\nproceeding forthwith but in no event more than thirty-five days after\\nthe filing of the petition. The petition shall be assigned, wherever\\npracticable, to the family court judge who heard the most recent\\npermanency or other proceeding involving the child.\\n  (E) If the family court that exercised jurisdiction over the\\npermanency or other proceeding involving the child declines to exercise\\njurisdiction over the adoption petition, the court in which the adoption\\npetition was filed shall issue an order incorporating that determination\\nand shall proceed forthwith.\\n  (iii) Neither such authorized agency nor any officer or agent thereof\\nneed appear before the judge or surrogate. The judge or surrogate in his\\nor her discretion may accept the report of an authorized agency verified\\nby one of its officers or agents as the report of investigation\\nhereinbefore required. In making orders of adoption the judge or\\nsurrogate when practicable must give custody only to persons of the same\\nreligious faith as that of the adoptive child in accordance with article\\nsix of the social services law.\\n",

If satisfied that the best interests of\\nthe adoptive child will be promoted thereby, the judge or surrogate\\nshall make an order approving the adoption and directing that the\\nadoptive child shall thenceforth be regarded and treated in all respects\\nas the child of the adoptive parents or parent. In determining whether\\nthe best interests of the adoptive child will be promoted by the\\nadoption, the judge or surrogate shall give due consideration to any\\nassurance by a local commissioner of social services that he or she will\\nprovide necessary support and maintenance for the adoptive child\\npursuant to the social services law. Such order shall contain the full\\nname, date and place of birth and reference to the schedule annexed to\\nthe petition containing the medical history of the child in the body\\nthereof and shall direct that the child's medical history, heritage of\\nthe birth parents, which shall include nationality, ethnic background\\nand race; education, which shall be the number of years of school\\ncompleted by the birth parents at the time of the birth and also at the\\ntime of surrender of the adoptive child; general physical appearance of\\nthe birth parents at the time of the birth and also at the time of\\nsurrender of the adoptive child, which shall include height, weight,\\ncolor of hair, eyes, skin; occupation of the birth parents at the time\\nof the birth and also at the time of surrender of the adoptive child;\\nhealth and medical history of the birth parents at the time of the birth\\nand also at the time of surrender of the adoptive child, including all\\navailable information setting forth conditions or diseases believed to\\nbe hereditary, any drugs or medication taken during the pregnancy by the\\nchild's mother; and any other information which may be a factor\\ninfluencing the child's present or future health, including the talents,\\nhobbies and special interests of the birth parents as contained in the\\npetition, be furnished to the adoptive parents, the commissioner and the\\nappropriate local registrar of vital statistics. If the judge or\\nsurrogate is also satisfied that there is no reasonable objection to the\\nchange of name proposed, the order shall direct that the name of the\\nadoptive child be changed to the name stated in the agreement of\\nadoption and that henceforth he or she shall be known by that name. All\\nsuch orders made by a family court judge of Westchester county since\\nSeptember first, nineteen hundred sixty-two, and on file in the office\\nof the county clerk of such county shall be transferred to the clerk of\\nthe family court of such county. Such order and all the papers in the\\nproceeding shall be filed in the office of the court granting the\\nadoption and the order shall be entered in books which shall be kept\\nunder seal and which shall be indexed by the name of the adoptive\\nparents and by the full original name of the child. Such order,\\nincluding orders heretofore entered, shall be subject to inspection and\\nexamination only as hereinafter provided. Notwithstanding the fact that\\nadoption records shall be sealed and secret, they may be microfilmed and\\nprocessed pursuant to an order of the court, provided that such order\\nprovides that the confidentiality of such records be maintained. If the\\nconfidentiality is violated, the person or company violating it can be\\nfound guilty of contempt of court. The fact that the adoptive child was\\nborn out of wedlock shall in no case appear in such order. The written\\nreport of the investigation together with all other papers pertaining to\\nthe adoption shall be kept by the judge or surrogate as a permanent\\nrecord of his or her court and such papers must be sealed by him or her\\nand withheld from inspection. No certified copy of the order of adoption\\nshall issue unless authorized by court order, except that certified\\ncopies may issue to the agency or agencies in the proceeding prior to\\nthe sealing of the papers. Before the record is sealed, such order may\\nbe granted upon written ex parte application on good cause shown and\\nupon such conditions as the court may impose. After the record is\\nsealed, such order may be granted only upon notice as hereinafter\\nprovided for disclosure or access and inspection of records. The clerk\\nupon request of a person or agency entitled thereto shall issue\\ncertificates of adoption which shall contain only the new name of the\\nchild and the date and place of birth of the child, the name of the\\nadoptive parents and the date when and court where the adoption was\\ngranted, which certificate as to the facts recited therein shall have\\nthe same force and effect as a certified copy of an order of adoption.\\nFor the purposes of this subdivision, the term \"commissioner\" shall mean\\nthe state commissioner of health and, with respect to an adoptive child\\nborn in the city of New York, the commissioner of health and mental\\nhygiene of the city of New York.\\n  2. No person, including the attorney for the adoptive parents shall\\ndisclose the surname of the child directly or indirectly to the adoptive\\nparents except upon order of the court. No person shall be allowed\\naccess to such sealed records and order and any index thereof except\\nupon an order of a judge or surrogate of the court in which the order\\nwas made or of a justice of the supreme court. No order for disclosure\\nor access and inspection shall be granted except on good cause shown and\\non due notice to the adoptive parents and to such additional persons as\\nthe court may direct. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to\\nrequire the state commissioner of health or his designee to secure a\\ncourt order authorizing disclosure of information contained in adoption\\nor birth records requested pursuant to the authority of section\\nforty-one hundred thirty-eight-c or section forty-one hundred\\nthirty-eight-d of the public health law; upon the receipt of such\\nrequest for information, the court shall transmit the information\\nauthorized to be released thereunder to the state commissioner of health\\nor his designee.\\n  3. In like manner as a court of general jurisdiction exercises such\\npowers, a judge or surrogate of a court in which the order of adoption\\nwas made may open, vacate or set aside such order of adoption for fraud,\\nnewly discovered evidence or other sufficient cause.\\n  4. Good cause for disclosure or access to and inspection of sealed\\nadoption records and orders and any index thereof, hereinafter the\\n\"adoption records\", under this section may be established on medical\\ngrounds as provided herein. Certification from a physician licensed to\\npractice medicine in the state of New York that relief under this\\nsubdivision is required to address a serious physical or mental illness\\nshall be prima facie evidence of good cause. Such certification shall\\nindentify the information required to address such illness. Except where\\nthere is an immediate medical need for the information sought, in which\\ncase the court may grant access to the adoption records directly to the\\npetitioner, the court hearing petition under the subdivision shall\\nappoint a guardian ad litem or other disinterested person, who shall\\nhave access to the adoption records for the purpose of obtaining the\\nmedical information sought from those records or, where the records are\\ninsufficient for such purpose, through contacting the biological\\nparents. The guardian or other disinterested person shall offer a\\nbiological parent the option of disclosing the medical information\\nsought by the petitioner pursuant to this subdivision, as well as the\\noption of granting consent to examine the parent's medical records. If\\nthe guardian or other disinterested person appointed does not obtain the\\nmedical information sought by the petitioner, such guardian or\\ndisinterested person shall make a report of his or her efforts to obtain\\nsuch information to the court. Where further efforts to obtain such\\ninformation are appropriate, the court may in its discretion authorize\\ndirect disclosure or access to and inspection of the adoption records by\\nthe petitioner.\\n",

The private-placement adoption of children who have been brought\\ninto the United States and the state for such purpose and placed with\\nthe adoptive parent or parents, shall be effected after issuance of the\\npre-adoption certificate, in the manner provided by this title,\\nexcepting that (a) the petition shall also recite the pre-adoption\\nproceedings, and (b) the court may in its discretion for good cause\\nshown, waive a subsequent investigation.

Except as provided for in\\nsubdivision eight of this section, a person or persons petitioning for\\ncertification as a qualified adoptive parent or parents shall upon a\\nform, promulgated by the chief administrator of the courts, provide to\\nthe court:\\n  (a) the applicant's name or applicants' names, residential address and\\ntelephone number;\\n  (b) a statement by the applicant or applicants that they are seeking\\ncertification by the court as a person or persons qualified to take\\nphysical custody of an infant prior to or contemporaneous with the\\nfiling of a private-placement adoption petition;\\n  (c) a statement by the applicant or applicants as to whether such\\napplicant or applicants have been the subject of an indicated report of\\nchild abuse or maltreatment, pursuant to title six of article six of the\\nsocial services law; and\\n  (d) a statement that a pre-placement investigation will be undertaken\\nby a disinterested person, as such term is defined in subdivision four\\nof this section, and that a written report of such investigation will be\\nfurnished directly to the court by such disinterested person with a copy\\nof such report to be delivered simultaneously to the applicant or\\napplicants. Such disinterested person shall certify to the court that he\\nor she is a disinterested person and has no interest in the outcome of\\nthe party's or parties' application. Such disinterested person shall\\nfurther disclose to the court any fee paid or to be paid to such person\\nfor services rendered in connection with the pre-placement\\ninvestigation.\\n  Such petition shall also require information regarding:\\n  (i) the marital and family status and history of the adoptive parent\\nor parents;\\n  (ii) the physical and mental health of the adoptive parent or parents;\\n  (iii) the property owned by and the income of adoptive parent or\\nparents;\\n  (iv) whether the adoptive parent or either of the adoptive parents has\\never been a respondent in any proceeding concerning allegedly abused,\\nneglected, abandoned or delinquent children; and\\n  (v) whether the applicant or applicants have made any prior\\napplication for certification as a qualified adoptive parent or parents\\nand, if so, the disposition of such application for certification.\\n  2. In any case where the applicant or applicants do not intend to\\ncause a pre-placement investigation to be undertaken pursuant to the\\nprovisions of paragraph (d) of subdivision one of this section, such\\napplicant or applicants shall request the court to appoint a\\ndisinterested person to conduct such pre-placement investigation. The\\ninvestigative written report shall be submitted to the judge or\\nsurrogate within thirty days, unless for good cause shown the judge or\\nsurrogate shall grant a reasonable extension of such period.\\n  3. Such applicant or applicants shall be financially responsible for\\nthe costs of any pre-placement investigation conducted pursuant to\\nsubdivision one or two of this section.\\n  3-a. (a) The court shall submit fingerprint cards and order a report\\nfrom the division of criminal justice services setting forth any\\nexisting criminal history record of the applicant for certification as a\\nqualified adoptive parent.\\n  (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, a\\npetition for certification as a qualified adoptive parent shall be\\ndenied where a criminal history record of the applicant reveals a\\nconviction for (i) a felony conviction at any time involving: (1) child\\nabuse or neglect; (2) spousal abuse; (3) a crime against a child,\\nincluding child pornography; or (4) a crime involving violence,\\nincluding rape, sexual assault, or homicide, other than a crime\\ninvolving physical assault or battery; or (ii) a felony conviction\\nwithin the past five years for physical assault, battery, or a\\ndrug-related offense.\\n  (c) For the purposes of this subdivision, \"spousal abuse\" is an\\noffense defined in section 120.05, 120.10, 121.12, or 121.13 of the\\npenal law where the victim of such offense was the defendant's spouse;\\nprovided, however, spousal abuse shall not include a crime in which the\\napplicant was the defendant, and the court finds in accordance with this\\nsubdivision that he or she was the victim of physical, sexual or\\npsychological abuse by the victim of such offense and such abuse was a\\nfactor in causing the applicant to commit such offense.\\n  4. A pre-placement investigation conducted pursuant to the provisions\\nof this section shall be made by a disinterested person who in the\\nopinion of the judge or surrogate is qualified by training and\\nexperience to examine into the allegations set forth in the application\\nand any other factors which may be relevant to the suitability of the\\napplicant or applicants as a qualified adoptive parent or parents. For\\nthe purposes of this section, a disinterested person shall also include\\na licensed master social worker, licensed clinical social worker, the\\nprobation service of the family court or an authorized agency\\nspecifically designated by the court to conduct pre-placement\\ninvestigations.\\n  5. Such disinterested person shall file with the court a written\\nreport of his or her investigation into the truth and accuracy of the\\nallegations set forth in the application and his or her investigation of\\nthe various factors which may be relevant to the suitability of the\\napplicant or applicants as qualified adoptive parents. Such\\ninvestigation shall include, but not be limited to, a personal interview\\nand visit at the applicant's or applicants' home and an investigation of\\nany other facts relating to the familial, social, religious, emotional\\nand financial circumstances of the adoptive parent or parents which may\\nbe relevant to certification as a qualified adoptive parent or parents.\\n  6. Certification and provisional certification. If after consideration\\nof the report submitted by the disinterested person, and all other\\nrelevant and material factors, the court grants the application, the\\napplicant or applicants may accept physical custody of a child for the\\npurposes of adoption, either prior to or contemporaneous with the filing\\nof an adoption petition. The order granting the petition shall be valid\\nfor a period not to exceed eighteen months and shall be accepted as\\nproof of certification by any court of competent jurisdiction within the\\nstate. The court may in its discretion grant a conditional order of\\ncertification upon satisfactory completion and submission of a petition\\nwherein the prospective adoptive parent or parents indicate no prior\\ncriminal convictions or founded findings of child abuse or neglect, and\\nafter completion of a disinterested person investigation provided for in\\nthis section, pending completion of any further reports, investigations\\nor inquiries ordered by the court or required by any other statute or\\ncourt rule. A conditional order of certification shall be valid and\\nremain in force and effect until replaced by an order of certification\\nor by an order denying the petition, whichever shall first occur, but in\\nno event shall such provisional certification continue beyond one\\nhundred eighty days from the date of original issuance. If the court\\ndenies the petition, the reasons for such denial shall be stated on the\\nrecord or in the order.\\n  7. Nothing in this section shall be deemed to waive, limit or restrict\\nthe provisions of any other law requiring any inquiry, disinterested\\nperson investigation or court review of any persons seeking to adopt a\\nchild under any provision of law.\\n  8. The provisions of this section shall not apply to petitions brought\\nby a step-parent for the adoption of a step-child where the step-child\\nhas resided with the birth parent and the step-parent for a continuous\\nperiod of at least one year.\\n  9. Extension of certification. When a petition for adoption is filed\\nby a qualified parent or parents previously certified and the balance of\\nthe time period remaining under such certification in accordance with\\nsubdivision six of this section is less than one year, the court may on\\nits own motion or on the motion of the petitioners extend the time\\nperiod of the original certification to a date eighteen months from the\\ndate of filing of the adoption petition. When a petition for adoption is\\nfiled by a qualified parent or parents who have previously been\\ncertified by an order which has expired within a year preceding the date\\nof the adoption petition, the court may extend the termination date of\\nthe earlier certification until eighteen months from the filing of such\\npetition, provided the petitioner apply for such extension and set forth\\nany change of circumstances of the qualified parent or parents since\\nissuance and expiration of the last certification which may be relevant\\nand material to the extension of such certification and affix thereto\\nwritten verification of any such changed circumstance or lack thereof by\\na disinterested person as defined in subdivision four of this section.\\nExcept as is provided for by this subdivision, the court shall not\\nextend a previously expired order of certification. Any further\\ncertification shall require the filing of a new petition for\\ncertification in accordance with subdivision six of this section.\\n  In any instance when the court determines whether to extend a\\ncertification under this subdivision, the court, in its discretion, may\\norder each or any of (a) a report from the statewide central registry of\\nchild abuse and maltreatment to determine whether the child or the\\npetitioner is or has been the subject of or another person named in an\\nindicated report, as such terms are defined in section four hundred\\ntwelve of the social services law, filed with such register, (b) a\\nreport from the division of criminal justice services setting forth any\\ncriminal record of such petitioner or petitioners, and (c) an additional\\npre-placement investigation to be undertaken by a disinterested person.\\nNothing herein shall be deemed to require that the court enter such an\\norder.\\n",

If the court is satisfied that the welfare of the\\nchild requires that it be removed from the home, the judge or surrogate\\nshall by order remove the child from the home of the petitioner or\\npetitioners and return the child to a birth parent or place the child\\nwith an appropriate authorized agency, or, in the case of a surrogate,\\ntransfer the child to the family court.

If the marriage be  annulled on\\nthe ground of the mental illness of a spouse, the court may include in\\nthe judgment an order providing for his or her suitable support, care\\nand maintenance during life from the property or income of the other\\nspouse. The court shall specify the amount of such support, care and\\nmaintenance and, before rendering judgment, may exact security for such\\nsupport, care and maintenance during life and shall order the filing and\\nrecording of the instrument creating such security in the office of the\\nclerk of the county in which the action is brought and the filing of two\\ncertified copies thereof with the office of mental health at its Albany\\noffice. The provisions of the judgment relating to support, care and\\nmaintenance of the mentally ill spouse during his or her life and to\\nsecurity therefor may be modified or amended at any time by the court\\nupon due notice to the other party and other interested parties as the\\ncourt may direct and in proper case the value of the suitable support,\\ncare and maintenance to such spouse during the balance of his or her\\nlife based upon appropriate mortality tables may be adjudged and\\ndetermined by the court in which the estate of a deceased spouse is\\nbeing administered and the same may be recovered on behalf of the\\nmentally ill spouse  from the estate of the deceased spouse.  If the\\nmentally ill spouse is maintained in an institution or otherwise under\\nthe jurisdiction of the office of mental health, the suitable support,\\ncare and maintenance as required in the judgment, unless otherwise\\ndirected by the court, shall be the charge established by the\\ncommissioner of mental health and such charge may be recovered in the\\nmanner provided by law. Such amount shall continue to be so required for\\nthe support of the mentally ill spouse in the event of his or her\\nremoval from the custody of the office of mental health unless\\nthereafter otherwise directed by the court. Any security exacted for the\\nsuitable support, care and maintenance during life of the mentally ill\\nspouse shall be available to that spouse or any person on his or her\\nbehalf or to any person or agency providing support, care and\\nmaintenance for such spouse in the event that the required payments for\\nsuch support, care and maintenance have not been made and upon\\napplication to the court the other spouse shall be ordered and directed\\nto provide additional or further security.\\n  2. Judgment annulling a marriage on such ground shall not be rendered\\nuntil, in addition to any other proofs in the case, a thorough\\nexamination of the alleged mentally ill party shall have been made by\\nthree physicians who are recognized authorities on mental disease, to be\\nappointed by the court, all of whom shall have agreed that such party is\\nincurably mentally ill and shall have so reported to the court. In such\\naction, the testimony of a physician attached to a state hospital in the\\ndepartment of mental hygiene as to information which he acquired in\\nattending a patient in a professional capacity at such hospital, shall\\nbe taken before a referee appointed by a judge of the court in which\\nsuch action is pending if the court in its discretion shall determine\\nthat the distance such physician must travel to attend the trial would\\nbe a great inconvenience to him or the hospital,  or that other\\nsufficient reason exists for the appointment of a referee for such\\npurpose; provided, however, that any judge of such court at any time in\\nhis discretion, notwithstanding such deposition, may order that a\\nsubpoena issue for the attendance and examination of such physician upon\\nthe trial of the action. In such case a copy of the order shall be\\nserved together with the subpoena.\\n  3. Except as provided in paragraph five, when the person alleged to be\\nincurably mentally ill is confined in a state hospital for the mentally\\nill of this state, one, and one only, of the physicians so appointed\\nshall be a member of the resident medical staff of such hospital\\ndesignated by the director thereof. If the alleged incurably mentally\\nill person is not confined in a state hospital for the mentally ill of\\nthis state, one of the examining physicians named in pursuance of this\\nsection shall be the director of a state hospital for the mentally ill\\nif the alleged mentally ill person is within this state, or the\\nsuperintendent or comparable officer of a state hospital for the\\nmentally ill of the state or country where the alleged mentally ill\\nperson is present if the alleged mentally ill person is outside of this\\nstate. The report of such superintendent or comparable officer of a\\nstate hospital for the mentally ill of such other state or country shall\\nnot be received in evidence or considered by the court unless he shall\\nbe a well educated physician with at least five years of training and\\nexperience in the care and treatment of persons suffering from mental\\ndisorders.\\n  4. When the plaintiff has been permitted to bring such action or\\nprosecute the same as a poor person and the alleged incurably mentally\\nill defendant is present within this state, the court shall appoint\\nthree physicians who are examining physicians, as defined by section\\n1.05 of the mental hygiene law, in the employment of the department of\\nmental hygiene. If the alleged mentally ill person be outside of this\\nstate, the court may, upon proof thereof, appoint three examining\\nphysicians who are qualified under the laws or regulations of the\\nforeign state or country where the alleged mentally ill person is\\npresent and who have qualifications comparable to those specified in\\nsection 1.05 of the mental hygiene law of the state, provided, however,\\nthat one of such examining physicians shall be the superintendent or\\ncomparable officer of a state hospital for the mentally ill of such\\nforeign state or country with qualifications as specified in paragraph\\nfour. Such examiners shall make the examination of the alleged mentally\\nill party present in this state and file with the court a verified\\nreport of their findings and conclusions without costs to such plaintiff\\nwhen the plaintiff is a poor person. Examination of an alleged mentally\\nill party present outside of this state shall be made at the expense of\\nthe plaintiff. Such report shall be received in evidence upon the trial\\nof the action without the personal appearance or testimony of such\\nexaminers. If the court shall deem it necessary that the testimony of\\nany such examiners be taken, the court may order the taking of such\\ntestimony by deposition only. The examiners so appointed by the court\\nmay be members of the resident medical staff of any state hospital,\\nwhether or not the alleged mentally ill person is being confined there.\\n",

Alimony. In any action or\\nproceeding brought (1) during the lifetime of both parties to the\\nmarriage to annul a marriage or declare the nullity of a void marriage,\\nor (2) for a separation, or (3) for a divorce, the court may direct\\neither spouse to provide suitably for the support of the other as, in\\nthe court's discretion, justice requires, having regard to the length of\\ntime of the marriage, the ability of each spouse to be self supporting,\\nthe circumstances of the case and of the respective parties. Such\\ndirection may require the payment of a sum or sums of money either\\ndirectly to either spouse or to third persons for real and personal\\nproperty and services furnished to either spouse, or for the rental of\\nor mortgage amortization or interest payments, insurance, taxes, repairs\\nor other carrying charges on premises occupied by either spouse, or for\\nboth payments to either spouse and to such third persons. Such direction\\nshall be effective as of the date of the application therefor, and any\\nretroactive amount of alimony due shall be paid in one sum or periodic\\nsums, as the court shall direct, taking into account any amount of\\ntemporary alimony which has been paid. Such direction may be made in the\\nfinal judgment in such action or proceeding, or by one or more orders\\nfrom time to time before or subsequent to final judgment, or by both\\nsuch order or orders and the final judgment. Such direction may be made\\nnotwithstanding that the parties continue to reside in the same abode\\nand notwithstanding that the court refuses to grant the relief requested\\nby either spouse (1) by reason of a finding by the court that a divorce,\\nannulment or judgment declaring the marriage a nullity had previously\\nbeen granted to either spouse in an action in which jurisdiction over\\nthe person of the other spouse was not obtained, or (2) by reason of the\\nmisconduct of the other spouse, unless such misconduct would itself\\nconstitute grounds for separation or divorce, or (3) by reason of a\\nfailure of proof of the grounds of either spouse's action or\\ncounterclaim. Any order or judgment made as in this section provided may\\ncombine in one lump sum any amount payable to either spouse under this\\nsection with any amount payable to either spouse under section two\\nhundred forty of this chapter. Upon the application of either spouse,\\nupon such notice to the other party and given in such manner as the\\ncourt shall direct, the court may annul or modify any such direction,\\nwhether made by order or by final judgment, or in case no such direction\\nshall have been made in the final judgment may, with respect to any\\njudgment of annulment or declaring the nullity of a void marriage\\nrendered on or after September first, nineteen hundred forty or any\\njudgment of separation or divorce whenever rendered, amend the judgment\\nby inserting such direction. Subject to the provisions of section two\\nhundred forty-four of this chapter, no such modification or annulment\\nshall reduce or annul arrears accrued prior to the making of such\\napplication unless the defaulting party shows good cause for failure to\\nmake application for relief from the judgment or order directing such\\npayment prior to the accrual of such arrears. Such modification may\\nincrease such support nunc pro tunc based on newly discovered evidence.\\n  2. Compulsory financial disclosure. In all matrimonial actions and\\nproceedings commenced on or after September first, nineteen hundred\\nseventy-five in supreme court in which alimony, maintenance or support\\nis in issue and all support proceedings in family court, there shall be\\ncompulsory disclosure by both parties of their respective financial\\nstates.

The court in its discretion, also may make a\\ndistributive award to supplement, facilitate or effectuate a\\ndistribution of marital property.\\n  f. In addition to the disposition of property as set forth above, the\\ncourt may make such order regarding the use and occupancy of the marital\\nhome and its household effects as provided in section two hundred\\nthirty-four of this chapter, without regard to the form of ownership of\\nsuch property.\\n  g. In any decision made pursuant to this subdivision, the court shall\\nset forth the factors it considered and the reasons for its decision and\\nsuch may not be waived by either party or counsel.\\n  h.

Law revision commission study. a. The legislature hereby finds\\nand declares it to be the policy of the state that it is necessary to\\nachieve equitable outcomes when families divorce and it is important to\\nensure that the economic consequences of a divorce are fairly shared by\\ndivorcing couples. Serious concerns have been raised that the\\nimplementation of New York state's maintenance laws have not resulted in\\nequitable results. Maintenance is often not granted and where it is\\ngranted, the results are inconsistent and unpredictable. This raises\\nserious concerns about the ability of our current maintenance laws to\\nachieve equitable and fair outcomes.\\n  The legislature further finds a comprehensive review of the provisions\\nof our state's maintenance laws should be undertaken. It has been thirty\\nyears since the legislature significantly reformed our state's divorce\\nlaws by enacting equitable distribution of marital property and\\nintroduced the concept of maintenance to replace alimony. Concerns that\\nthe implementation of our maintenance laws have not resulted in\\nequitable results compel the need for a review of these laws.\\n  b. The law revision commission is hereby directed to:\\n  (1) review and assess the economic consequences of divorce on the\\nparties;\\n  (2) review the maintenance laws of the state, including the way in\\nwhich they are administered to determine the impact of these laws on\\npost marital economic disparities, and the effectiveness of such laws\\nand their administration in achieving the state's policy goals and\\nobjectives of ensuring that the economic consequences of a divorce are\\nfairly and equitably shared by the divorcing couple; and\\n  (3) make recommendations to the legislature, including such proposed\\nrevisions of such laws as it determines necessary to achieve these goals\\nand objectives.\\n  c. The law revision commission shall make a preliminary report to the\\nlegislature and the governor of its findings, conclusions, and any\\nrecommendations not later than nine months from the effective date of\\nthis subdivision, and a final report of its findings, conclusions and\\nrecommendations not later than December thirty-first, two thousand\\neleven.\\n  7. Child support. a. In any matrimonial action, or in an independent\\naction for child  support, the court as provided in section two hundred\\nforty of this chapter shall order either or both parents to pay\\ntemporary child support or child support without requiring a showing of\\nimmediate or emergency need. The court shall make an order for temporary\\nchild support notwithstanding that information with respect to income\\nand assets of either or both parents may be unavailable. Where such\\ninformation is available, the court may make an order for temporary\\nchild support pursuant to section two hundred forty of this article.\\nSuch order shall, except as provided for herein, be effective as of the\\ndate of the application therefor, and any retroactive amount of child\\nsupport due shall be support arrears/past due support and shall be paid\\nin one sum or periodic sums, as the court shall direct, taking into\\naccount any amount of temporary child support which has been paid. In\\naddition, such retroactive child support shall be enforceable in any\\nmanner provided by law including, but not limited to, an execution for\\nsupport enforcement pursuant to subdivision (b) of section fifty-two\\nhundred forty-one of the civil practice law and rules. When a child\\nreceiving support is a public assistance recipient, or the order of\\nsupport is being enforced or is to be enforced pursuant to section one\\nhundred eleven-g of the social services law, the court shall establish\\nthe amount of retroactive child support and notify the parties that such\\namount shall be enforced by the support collection unit pursuant to an\\nexecution for support enforcement as provided for in subdivision (b) of\\nsection fifty-two hundred forty-one of the civil practice law and rules,\\nor in such periodic payments as would have been authorized had such an\\nexecution been issued. In such case, the court shall not direct the\\nschedule of repayment of retroactive support. The court shall not\\nconsider the misconduct of either party but shall make its award for\\nchild support pursuant to section two hundred forty of this article.\\n  b. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any written application\\nor motion to the court for the establishment of a child support\\nobligation for persons not in receipt of family assistance must contain\\neither a request for child support enforcement services which would\\nauthorize the collection of the support obligation by the immediate\\nissuance of an income execution for support enforcement as provided for\\nby this chapter, completed in the manner specified in section one\\nhundred eleven-g of the social services law; or a statement that the\\napplicant has applied for or is in receipt of such services; or a\\nstatement that the applicant knows of the availability of such services,\\nhas declined them at this time and where support enforcement services\\npursuant to section one hundred eleven-g of the social services law have\\nbeen declined that the applicant understands that an income deduction\\norder may be issued pursuant to subdivision (c) of section five thousand\\ntwo hundred forty-two of the civil practice law and rules without other\\nchild support enforcement services and that payment of an administrative\\nfee may be required. The court shall provide a copy of any such request\\nfor child support enforcement services to the support collection unit of\\nthe appropriate social services district any time it directs payments to\\nbe made to such support collection unit. Additionally, the copy of any\\nsuch request shall be accompanied by the name, address and social\\nsecurity number of the parties; the date and place of the parties'\\nmarriage; the name and date of birth of the child or children; and the\\nname and address of the employers and income payors of the party from\\nwhom child support is sought. Unless the party receiving child support\\nhas applied for or is receiving such services, the court shall not\\ndirect such payments to be made to the support collection unit, as\\nestablished in section one hundred eleven-h of the social services law.\\n  c. The court shall direct that a copy of any child support or combined\\nchild and spousal support order issued by the court on or after the\\nfirst day of October, nineteen hundred ninety-eight, in any proceeding\\nunder this section be provided promptly to the state case registry\\nestablished pursuant to subdivision four-a of section one hundred\\neleven-b of the social services law.\\n  d. Any child support order made by the court in any proceeding under\\nthe provisions of this section shall include, on its face, a notice\\nprinted or typewritten in a size equal to at least eight point bold type\\ninforming the parties of their right to seek a modification of the child\\nsupport order upon a showing of:\\n  (i) a substantial change in circumstances; or\\n  (ii) that three years have passed since the order was entered, last\\nmodified or adjusted; or\\n  (iii) there has been a change in either party's gross income by\\nfifteen percent or more since the order was entered, last modified, or\\nadjusted;\\nhowever, if the parties have specifically opted out of subparagraph (ii)\\nor (iii) of this paragraph in a validly executed agreement or\\nstipulation, then that basis to seek modification does not apply.\\n  8. Special relief in matrimonial actions.  a. In any matrimonial\\naction the court may order a party to purchase, maintain or assign a\\npolicy of insurance providing benefits for health and hospital care and\\nrelated services for either spouse or children of the marriage not to\\nexceed such period of time as such party shall be obligated to provide\\nmaintenance, child support or make payments of a distributive award. The\\ncourt may also order a party to purchase, maintain or assign a policy of\\naccident insurance or insurance on the life of either spouse, and to\\ndesignate in the case of life insurance, either spouse or children of\\nthe marriage, or in the case of accident insurance, the insured spouse\\nas irrevocable beneficiaries during a period of time fixed by the court.\\nThe obligation to provide such insurance shall cease upon the\\ntermination of the spouse's duty to provide maintenance, child support\\nor a distributive award. A copy of such order shall be served, by\\nregistered mail, on the home office of the insurer specifying the name\\nand mailing address of the spouse or children, provided that failure to\\nso serve the insurer shall not affect the validity of the order.\\n  b. In any action where the court has ordered temporary maintenance,\\nmaintenance, distributive award or child support, the court may direct\\nthat a payment be made directly to the other spouse or a third person\\nfor real and personal property and services furnished to the other\\nspouse, or for the rental or mortgage amortization or interest payments,\\ninsurances, taxes, repairs or other carrying charges on premises\\noccupied by the other spouse, or for both payments to the other spouse\\nand to such third persons. Such direction may be made notwithstanding\\nthat the parties continue to reside in the same abode and\\nnotwithstanding that the court refuses to grant the relief requested by\\nthe other spouse.\\n  c. Any order or judgment made as in this section provided may combine\\nany amount payable to either spouse under this section with any amount\\npayable to such spouse as child support or under section two hundred\\nforty of this chapter.\\n  9. Enforcement and modification of orders and judgments in matrimonial\\nactions. a. All orders or judgments entered in matrimonial actions shall\\nbe enforceable pursuant to section fifty-two hundred forty-one or\\nfifty-two hundred forty-two of the civil practice law and rules, or in\\nany other manner provided by law. Orders or judgments for child support,\\nalimony and maintenance shall also be enforceable pursuant to article\\nfifty-two of the civil practice law and rules upon a debtor's default as\\nsuch term is defined in paragraph seven of subdivision (a) of section\\nfifty-two hundred forty-one of the civil practice law and rules. The\\nestablishment of a default shall be subject to the procedures\\nestablished for the determination of a mistake of fact for income\\nexecutions pursuant to subdivision (e) of section fifty-two hundred\\nforty-one of the civil practice law and rules. For the purposes of\\nenforcement of child support orders or combined spousal and child\\nsupport orders pursuant to section five thousand two hundred forty-one\\nof the civil practice law and rules, a \"default\" shall be deemed to\\ninclude amounts arising from retroactive support. The court may, and if\\na party shall fail or refuse to pay maintenance, distributive award or\\nchild support the court shall, upon notice and an opportunity to the\\ndefaulting party to be heard, require the party to furnish a surety, or\\nthe sequestering and sale of assets for the purpose of enforcing any\\naward for maintenance, distributive award or child support and for the\\npayment of reasonable and necessary attorney's fees and disbursements.\\n  b. (1) Upon application by either party, the court may annul or modify\\nany prior order or judgment made after trial as to maintenance, upon a\\nshowing of the payee's inability to be self-supporting or upon a showing\\nof a substantial change in circumstance, including financial hardship or\\nupon actual full or partial retirement of the payor if the retirement\\nresults in a substantial change in financial circumstances. Where, after\\nthe effective date of this part, an agreement remains in force, no\\nmodification of an order or judgment incorporating the terms of said\\nagreement shall be made as to maintenance without a showing of extreme\\nhardship on either party, in which event the judgment or order as\\nmodified shall supersede the terms of the prior agreement and judgment\\nfor such period of time and under such circumstances as the court\\ndetermines. The court shall not reduce or annul any arrears of\\nmaintenance which have been reduced to final judgment pursuant to\\nsection two hundred forty-four of this article. No other arrears of\\nmaintenance which have accrued prior to the making of such application\\nshall be subject to modification or annulment unless the defaulting\\nparty shows good cause for failure to make application for relief from\\nthe judgment or order directing such payment prior to the accrual of\\nsuch arrears and the facts and circumstances constituting good cause are\\nset forth in a written memorandum of decision. Such modification may\\nincrease maintenance nunc pro tunc as of the date of application based\\non newly discovered evidence. Any retroactive amount of maintenance due\\nshall, except as provided for herein, be paid in one sum or periodic\\nsums, as the court directs, taking into account any temporary or partial\\npayments which have been made. The provisions of this subdivision shall\\nnot apply to a separation agreement made prior to the effective date of\\nthis part.\\n  (2) (i) The court may modify an order of child support, including an\\norder incorporating without merging an agreement or stipulation of the\\nparties, upon a showing of a substantial change in circumstances.\\nIncarceration shall not be considered voluntary unemployment and shall\\nnot be a bar to finding a substantial change in circumstances provided\\nsuch incarceration is not the result of non-payment of a child support\\norder, or an offense against the custodial parent or child who is the\\nsubject of the order or judgment.\\n  (ii) In addition, unless the parties have specifically opted out of\\nthe following provisions in a validly executed agreement or stipulation\\nentered into between the parties, the court may modify an order of child\\nsupport where:\\n  (A) three years have passed since the order was entered, last modified\\nor adjusted; or\\n  (B) there has been a change in either party's gross income by fifteen\\npercent or more since the order was entered, last modified, or adjusted.\\nA reduction in income shall not be considered as a ground for\\nmodification unless it was involuntary and the party has made diligent\\nattempts to secure employment commensurate with his or her education,\\nability, and experience.\\n  (iii) No modification or annulment shall reduce or annul any arrears\\nof child support which have accrued prior to the date of application to\\nannul or modify any prior order or judgment as to child support. Such\\nmodification may increase child support nunc pro tunc as of the date of\\napplication based on newly discovered evidence. Any retroactive amount\\nof child support due shall, except as provided for in this subparagraph,\\nbe paid in one sum or periodic sums, as the court directs, taking into\\naccount any temporary or partial payments which have been made. Any\\nretroactive amount of child support due shall be support arrears/past\\ndue support. In addition, such retroactive child support shall be\\nenforceable in any manner provided by law including, but not limited to,\\nan execution for support enforcement pursuant to subdivision (b) of\\nsection fifty-two hundred forty-one of the civil practice law and rules.\\nWhen a child receiving support is a public assistance recipient, or the\\norder of support is being enforced or is to be enforced pursuant to\\nsection one hundred eleven-g of the social services law, the court shall\\nestablish the amount of retroactive child support and notify the parties\\nthat such amount shall be enforced by the support collection unit\\npursuant to an immediate execution for support enforcement as provided\\nfor by this chapter, or in such periodic payments as would have been\\nauthorized had such an execution been issued. In such case, the court\\nshall not direct the schedule of repayment of retroactive support.\\n  c. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any written application\\nor motion to the court for the modification or enforcement of a child\\nsupport or combined maintenance and child support order for persons not\\nin receipt of family assistance must contain either a request for child\\nsupport enforcement services which would authorize the collection of the\\nsupport obligation by the immediate issuance of an income execution for\\nsupport enforcement as provided for by this chapter, completed in the\\nmanner specified in section one hundred eleven-g of the social services\\nlaw; or a statement that the applicant has applied for or is in receipt\\nof such services; or a statement that the applicant knows of the\\navailability of such services, has declined them at this time and where\\nsupport enforcement services pursuant to section one hundred eleven-g of\\nthe social services law have been declined that the applicant\\nunderstands that an income deduction order may be issued pursuant to\\nsubdivision (c) of section five thousand two hundred forty-two of the\\ncivil practice law and rules without other child support enforcement\\nservices and that payment of an administrative fee may be required. The\\ncourt shall provide a copy of any such request for child support\\nenforcement services to the support collection unit of the appropriate\\nsocial services district any time it directs payments to be made to such\\nsupport collection unit. Additionally, the copy of such request shall be\\naccompanied by the name, address and social security number of the\\nparties; the date and place of the parties' marriage; the name and date\\nof birth of the child or children; and the name and address of the\\nemployers and income payors of the party ordered to pay child support to\\nthe other party. Unless the party receiving child support or combined\\nmaintenance and child support has applied for or is receiving such\\nservices, the court shall not direct such payments to be made to the\\nsupport collection unit, as established in section one hundred eleven-h\\nof the social services law.\\n  d. The court shall direct that a copy of any child support or combined\\nchild and spousal support order issued by the court on or after the\\nfirst day of October, nineteen hundred ninety-eight, in any proceeding\\nunder this section be provided promptly to the state case registry\\nestablished pursuant to subdivision four-a of section one hundred\\neleven-b of the social services law.\\n",

(a) In any\\naction or proceeding brought (1) to annul a marriage or to declare the\\nnullity of a void marriage, or (2) for a separation, or (3) for a\\ndivorce, or (4) to obtain, by a writ of habeas corpus or by petition and\\norder to show cause, the custody of or right to visitation with any\\nchild of a marriage, the court shall require verification of the status\\nof any child of the marriage with respect to such child's custody and\\nsupport, including any prior orders, and shall enter orders for custody\\nand support as, in the court's discretion, justice requires, having\\nregard to the circumstances of the case and of the respective parties\\nand to the best interests of the child and subject to the provisions of\\nsubdivision one-c of this section. Where either party to an action\\nconcerning custody of or a right to visitation with a child alleges in a\\nsworn petition or complaint or sworn answer, cross-petition,\\ncounterclaim or other sworn responsive pleading that the other party has\\ncommitted an act of domestic violence against the party making the\\nallegation or a family or household member of either party, as such\\nfamily or household member is defined in article eight of the family\\ncourt act, and such allegations are proven by a preponderance of the\\nevidence, the court must consider the effect of such domestic violence\\nupon the best interests of the child, together with such other facts and\\ncircumstances as the court deems relevant in making a direction pursuant\\nto this section and state on the record how such findings, facts and\\ncircumstances factored into the direction. If a parent makes a good\\nfaith allegation based on a reasonable belief supported by facts that\\nthe child is the victim of child abuse, child neglect, or the effects of\\ndomestic violence, and if that parent acts lawfully and in good faith in\\nresponse to that reasonable belief to protect the child or seek\\ntreatment for the child, then that parent shall not be deprived of\\ncustody, visitation or contact with the child, or restricted in custody,\\nvisitation or contact, based solely on that belief or the reasonable\\nactions taken based on that belief. If an allegation that a child is\\nabused is supported by a preponderance of the evidence, then the court\\nshall consider such evidence of abuse in determining the visitation\\narrangement that is in the best interest of the child, and the court\\nshall not place a child in the custody of a parent who presents a\\nsubstantial risk of harm to that child, and shall state on the record\\nhow such findings were factored into the determination. Where a\\nproceeding filed pursuant to article ten or ten-A of the family court\\nact is pending at the same time as a proceeding brought in the supreme\\ncourt involving the custody of, or right to visitation with, any child\\nof a marriage, the court presiding over the proceeding under article ten\\nor ten-A of the family court act may jointly hear the dispositional\\nhearing on the petition under article ten or the permanency hearing\\nunder article ten-A of the family court act and, upon referral from the\\nsupreme court, the hearing to resolve the matter of custody or\\nvisitation in the proceeding pending in the supreme court; provided\\nhowever, the court must determine custody or visitation in accordance\\nwith the terms of this section.\\n  An order directing the payment of child support shall contain the\\nsocial security numbers of the named parties. In all cases there shall\\nbe no prima facie right to the custody of the child in either parent.\\nSuch direction shall make provision for child support out of the\\nproperty of either or both parents. The court shall make its award for\\nchild support pursuant to subdivision one-b of this section. Such\\ndirection may provide for reasonable visitation rights to the maternal\\nand/or paternal grandparents of any child of the parties. Such direction\\nas it applies to rights of visitation with a child remanded or placed in\\nthe care of a person, official, agency or institution pursuant to\\narticle ten of the family court act, or pursuant to an instrument\\napproved under section three hundred fifty-eight-a of the social\\nservices law, shall be enforceable pursuant to part eight of article ten\\nof the family court act and sections three hundred fifty-eight-a and\\nthree hundred eighty-four-a of the social services law and other\\napplicable provisions of law against any person having care and custody,\\nor temporary care and custody, of the child. Notwithstanding any other\\nprovision of law, any written application or motion to the court for the\\nestablishment, modification or enforcement of a child support obligation\\nfor persons not in receipt of public assistance and care must contain\\neither a request for child support enforcement services which would\\nauthorize the collection of the support obligation by the immediate\\nissuance of an income execution for support enforcement as provided for\\nby this chapter, completed in the manner specified in section one\\nhundred eleven-g of the social services law; or a statement that the\\napplicant has applied for or is in receipt of such services; or a\\nstatement that the applicant knows of the availability of such services,\\nhas declined them at this time and where support enforcement services\\npursuant to section one hundred eleven-g of the social services law have\\nbeen declined that the applicant understands that an income deduction\\norder may be issued pursuant to subdivision (c) of section fifty-two\\nhundred forty-two of the civil practice law and rules without other\\nchild support enforcement services and that payment of an administrative\\nfee may be required. The court shall provide a copy of any such request\\nfor child support enforcement services to the support collection unit of\\nthe appropriate social services district any time it directs payments to\\nbe made to such support collection unit. Additionally, the copy of any\\nsuch request shall be accompanied by the name, address and social\\nsecurity number of the parties; the date and place of the parties'\\nmarriage; the name and date of birth of the child or children; and the\\nname and address of the employers and income payors of the party from\\nwhom child support is sought or from the party ordered to pay child\\nsupport to the other party. Such direction may require the payment of a\\nsum or sums of money either directly to the custodial parent or to third\\npersons for goods or services furnished for such child, or for both\\npayments to the custodial parent and to such third persons; provided,\\nhowever, that unless the party seeking or receiving child support has\\napplied for or is receiving such services, the court shall not direct\\nsuch payments to be made to the support collection unit, as established\\nin section one hundred eleven-h of the social services law. Every order\\ndirecting the payment of support shall require that if either parent\\ncurrently, or at any time in the future, has health insurance benefits\\navailable that may be extended or obtained to cover the child, such\\nparent is required to exercise the option of additional coverage in\\nfavor of such child and execute and deliver to such person any forms,\\nnotices, documents or instruments necessary to assure timely payment of\\nany health insurance claims for such child.\\n  (a-1)(1) Permanent and initial temporary orders of custody or\\nvisitation. Prior to the issuance of any permanent or initial temporary\\norder of custody or visitation, the court shall conduct a review of the\\ndecisions and reports listed in subparagraph three of this paragraph.\\n  (2) Successive temporary orders of custody or visitation. Prior to the\\nissuance of any successive temporary order of custody or visitation, the\\ncourt shall conduct a review of the decisions and reports listed in\\nsubparagraph three of this paragraph, unless such a review has been\\nconducted within ninety days prior to the issuance of such order.\\n  (3) Decisions and reports for review. The court shall conduct a review\\nof the following:\\n  (i) related decisions in court proceedings initiated pursuant to\\narticle ten of the family court act, and all warrants issued under the\\nfamily court act; and\\n  (ii) reports of the statewide computerized registry of orders of\\nprotection established and maintained pursuant to section two hundred\\ntwenty-one-a of the executive law, and reports of the sex offender\\nregistry established and maintained pursuant to section one hundred\\nsixty-eight-b of the correction law.\\n  (4) Notifying counsel and issuing orders. Upon consideration of\\ndecisions pursuant to article ten of the family court act, and registry\\nreports and notifying counsel involved in the proceeding, or in the\\nevent of a self-represented party, notifying such party of the results\\nthereof, including any court appointed attorney for children, the court\\nmay issue a temporary, successive temporary or final order of custody or\\nvisitation.\\n  (5) Temporary emergency order. Notwithstanding any other provision of\\nthe law, upon emergency situations, including computer malfunctions, to\\nserve the best interest of the child, the court may issue a temporary\\nemergency order for custody or visitation in the event that it is not\\npossible to timely review decisions and reports on registries as\\nrequired pursuant to subparagraph three of this paragraph.\\n  (6) After issuing a temporary emergency order. After issuing a\\ntemporary emergency order of custody or visitation, the court shall\\nconduct reviews of the decisions and reports on registries as required\\npursuant to subparagraph three of this paragraph within twenty-four\\nhours of the issuance of such temporary emergency order. Should such\\ntwenty-four hour period fall on a day when court is not in session, then\\nthe required reviews shall take place the next day the court is in\\nsession. Upon reviewing decisions and reports the court shall notify\\nassociated counsel, self-represented parties and attorneys for children\\npursuant to subparagraph four of this paragraph and may issue temporary\\nor permanent custody or visitation orders.\\n  (7) Feasibility study. The commissioner of the office of children and\\nfamily services, in conjunction with the office of court administration,\\nis hereby authorized and directed to examine, study, evaluate and make\\nrecommendations concerning the feasibility of the utilization of\\ncomputers in courts which are connected to the statewide central\\nregister of child abuse and maltreatment established and maintained\\npursuant to section four hundred twenty-two of the social services law,\\nas a means of providing courts with information regarding parties\\nrequesting orders of custody or visitation. Such commissioner shall make\\na preliminary report to the governor and the legislature of findings,\\nconclusions and recommendations not later than January first, two\\nthousand nine, and a final report of findings, conclusions and\\nrecommendations not later than June first, two thousand nine, and shall\\nsubmit with the reports such legislative proposals as are deemed\\nnecessary to implement the commissioner's recommendations.\\n  (a-2) Military service by parent; effect on child custody orders. (1)\\nDuring the period of time that a parent is activated, deployed or\\ntemporarily assigned to military service, such that the parent's ability\\nto continue as a joint caretaker or the primary caretaker of a minor\\nchild is materially affected by such military service, any orders issued\\npursuant to this section, based on the fact that the parent is\\nactivated, deployed or temporarily assigned to military service, which\\nwould materially affect or change a previous judgment or order regarding\\ncustody of that parent's child or children as such judgment or order\\nexisted on the date the parent was activated, deployed, or temporarily\\nassigned to military service, shall be subject to review pursuant to\\nsubparagraph three of this paragraph. Any relevant provisions of the\\nService Member's Civil Relief Act shall apply to all proceedings\\ngoverned by this section.\\n  (2) During such period, the court may enter an order to modify custody\\nif there is clear and convincing evidence that the modification is in\\nthe best interests of the child. An attorney for the child shall be\\nappointed in all cases where a modification is sought during such\\nmilitary service. Such order shall be subject to review pursuant to\\nsubparagraph three of this paragraph. When entering an order pursuant to\\nthis section, the court shall consider and provide for, if feasible and\\nif in the best interests of the child, contact between the military\\nservice member and his or her child, including, but not limited to,\\nelectronic communication by e-mail, webcam, telephone, or other\\navailable means. During the period of the parent's leave from military\\nservice, the court shall consider the best interests of the child when\\nestablishing a parenting schedule, including visiting and other contact.\\nFor such purposes, a \"leave from military service\" shall be a period of\\nnot more than three months.\\n  (3) Unless the parties have otherwise stipulated or agreed, if an\\norder is issued pursuant to this paragraph, the return of the parent\\nfrom active military service, deployment or temporary assignment shall\\nbe considered a substantial change in circumstances. Upon the request of\\neither parent, the court shall determine on the basis of the child's\\nbest interests whether the custody judgment or order previously in\\neffect should be modified.\\n  (4) This paragraph shall not apply to assignments to permanent duty\\nstations or permanent changes of station.\\n  (b) As used in this section, the following terms shall have the\\nfollowing meanings:\\n  (1) \"Health insurance benefits\" means any medical, dental, optical and\\nprescription drugs and health care services or other health care\\nbenefits that may be provided for a dependent through an employer or\\norganization, including such employers or organizations which are self\\ninsured, or through other available health insurance or health care\\ncoverage plans.\\n  (2) \"Available health insurance benefits\" means any health insurance\\nbenefits that are reasonable in cost and that are reasonably accessible\\nto the person on whose behalf the petition is brought. Health insurance\\nbenefits that are not reasonable in cost or whose services are not\\nreasonably accessible to such person, shall be considered unavailable.\\n  (3) When the person on whose behalf the petition is brought is a child\\nin accordance with paragraph (c) of this subdivision, health insurance\\nbenefits shall be considered \"reasonable in cost\" if the cost of health\\ninsurance benefits does not exceed five percent of the combined parental\\ngross income. The cost of health insurance benefits shall refer to the\\ncost of the premium and deductible attributable to adding the child or\\nchildren to existing coverage or the difference between such costs for\\nself-only and family coverage. Provided, however, the presumption that\\nthe health insurance benefits are reasonable in cost may be rebutted\\nupon a finding that the cost is unjust or inappropriate which finding\\nshall be based on the circumstances of the case, the cost and\\ncomprehensiveness of the health insurance benefits for which the child\\nor children may otherwise be eligible, and the best interests of the\\nchild or children. In no instance shall health insurance benefits be\\nconsidered \"reasonable in cost\" if a parent's share of the cost of\\nextending such coverage would reduce the income of that parent below the\\nself-support reserve. Health insurance benefits are \"reasonably\\naccessible\" if the child lives within the geographic area covered by the\\nplan or lives within thirty minutes or thirty miles of travel time from\\nthe child's residence to the services covered by the health insurance\\nbenefits or through benefits provided under a reciprocal agreement;\\nprovided, however, this presumption may be rebutted for good cause shown\\nincluding, but not limited to, the special health needs of the child.\\nThe court shall set forth such finding and the reasons therefor in the\\norder of support.\\n  (c) When the person on whose behalf the petition is brought is a\\nchild, the court shall consider the availability of health insurance\\nbenefits to all parties and shall take the following action to ensure\\nthat health insurance benefits are provided for the benefit of the\\nchild:\\n  (1) Where the child is presently covered by health insurance benefits,\\nthe court shall direct in the order of support that such coverage be\\nmaintained, unless either parent requests the court to make a direction\\nfor health insurance benefits coverage pursuant to paragraph two of this\\nsubdivision.\\n  (2) Where the child is not presently covered by health insurance\\nbenefits, the court shall make a determination as follows:\\n  (i) If only one parent has available health insurance benefits, the\\ncourt shall direct in the order of support that such parent provide\\nhealth insurance benefits.\\n  (ii) If both parents have available health insurance benefits the\\ncourt shall direct in the order of support that either parent or both\\nparents provide such health insurance. The court shall make such\\ndetermination based on the circumstances of the case, including, but not\\nlimited to, the cost and comprehensiveness of the respective health\\ninsurance benefits and the best interests of the child.\\n  (iii) If neither parent has available health insurance benefits, the\\ncourt shall direct in the order of support that the custodial parent\\napply for the state's child health insurance plan pursuant to title\\none-A of article twenty-five of the public health law and the medical\\nassistance program established pursuant to title eleven of article five\\nof the social services law. A direction issued under this subdivision\\nshall not limit or alter either parent's obligation to obtain health\\ninsurance benefits at such time as they become available, as required\\npursuant to paragraph (a) of this subdivision. Nothing in this\\nsubdivision shall alter or limit the authority of the medical assistance\\nprogram to determine when it is considered cost effective to require a\\ncustodial parent to enroll a child in an available group health\\ninsurance plan pursuant to paragraphs (b) and (c) of subdivision one of\\nsection three hundred sixty-seven-a of the social services law.\\n  (d) The cost of providing health insurance benefits or benefits under\\nthe state's child health insurance plan or the medical assistance\\nprogram, pursuant to paragraph (c) of this subdivision, shall be deemed\\ncash medical support, and the court shall determine the obligation of\\neither or both parents to contribute to the cost thereof pursuant to\\nsubparagraph five of paragraph (c) of subdivision one-b of this section.\\n  (e) The court shall provide in the order of support that the legally\\nresponsible relative immediately notify the other party, or the other\\nparty and the support collection unit when the order is issued on behalf\\nof a child in receipt of public assistance and care or in receipt of\\nservices pursuant to section one hundred eleven-g of the social services\\nlaw, of any change in health insurance benefits, including any\\ntermination of benefits, change in the health insurance benefit carrier,\\npremium, or extent and availability of existing or new benefits.\\n  (f) Where the court determines that health insurance benefits are\\navailable, the court shall provide in the order of support that the\\nlegally responsible relative immediately enroll the eligible dependents\\nnamed in the order who are otherwise eligible for such benefits without\\nregard to any seasonal enrollment restrictions. Such order shall further\\ndirect the legally responsible relative to maintain such benefits as\\nlong as they remain available to such relative. Such order shall further\\ndirect the legally responsible relative to assign all insurance\\nreimbursement payments for health care expenses incurred for his or her\\neligible dependents to the provider of such services or the party\\nactually having incurred and satisfied such expenses, as appropriate.\\n  (g) When the court issues an order of child support or combined child\\nand spousal support on behalf of persons in receipt of public assistance\\nand care or in receipt of services pursuant to section one hundred\\neleven-g of the social services law, such order shall further direct\\nthat the provision of health care benefits shall be immediately enforced\\npursuant to section fifty-two hundred forty-one of the civil practice\\nlaw and rules.\\n  (h) When the court issues an order of child support or combined child\\nand spousal support on behalf of persons other than those in receipt of\\npublic assistance and care or in receipt of services pursuant to section\\none hundred eleven-g of the social services law, the court shall also\\nissue a separate order which shall include the necessary direction to\\nensure the order's characterization as a qualified medical child support\\norder as defined by section six hundred nine of the employee retirement\\nincome security act of 1974 (29 USC 1169). Such order shall: (i) clearly\\nstate that it creates or recognizes the existence of the right of the\\nnamed dependent to be enrolled and to receive benefits for which the\\nlegally responsible relative is eligible under the available group\\nhealth plans, and shall clearly specify the name, social security number\\nand mailing address of the legally responsible relative, and of each\\ndependent to be covered by the order; (ii) provide a clear description\\nof the type of coverage to be provided by the group health plan to each\\nsuch dependent or the manner in which the type of coverage is to be\\ndetermined; and (iii) specify the period of time to which the order\\napplies. The court shall not require the group health plan to provide\\nany type or form of benefit or option not otherwise provided under the\\ngroup health plan except to the extent necessary to meet the\\nrequirements of a law relating to medical child support described in\\nsection one thousand three hundred and ninety-six g of title forty-two\\nof the United States code.\\n  (i) Upon a finding that a legally responsible relative wilfully failed\\nto obtain health insurance benefits in violation of a court order, such\\nrelative will be presumptively liable for all health care expenses\\nincurred on behalf of such dependents from the first date such\\ndependents were eligible to be enrolled to receive health insurance\\nbenefits after the issuance of the order of support directing the\\nacquisition of such coverage.\\n  (j) The order shall be effective as of the date of the application\\ntherefor, and any retroactive amount of child support due shall be\\nsupport arrears/past due support and shall, except as provided for\\nherein, be paid in one lump sum or periodic sums, as the court shall\\ndirect, taking into account any amount of temporary support which has\\nbeen paid. In addition, such retroactive child support shall be\\nenforceable in any manner provided by law including, but not limited to,\\nan execution for support enforcement pursuant to subdivision (b) of\\nsection fifty-two hundred forty-one of the civil practice law and rules.\\nWhen a child receiving support is a public assistance recipient, or the\\norder of support is being enforced or is to be enforced pursuant to\\nsection one hundred eleven-g of the social services law, the court shall\\nestablish the amount of retroactive child support and notify the parties\\nthat such amount shall be enforced by the support collection unit\\npursuant to an execution for support enforcement as provided for in\\nsubdivision (b) of section fifty-two hundred forty-one of the civil\\npractice law and rules, or in such periodic payments as would have been\\nauthorized had such an execution been issued. In such case, the courts\\nshall not direct the schedule of repayment of retroactive support. Where\\nsuch direction is for child support and paternity has been established\\nby a voluntary acknowledgement of paternity as defined in section\\nforty-one hundred thirty-five-b of the public health law, the court\\nshall inquire of the parties whether the acknowledgement has been duly\\nfiled, and unless satisfied that it has been so filed shall require the\\nclerk of the court to file such acknowledgement with the appropriate\\nregistrar within five business days. Such direction may be made in the\\nfinal judgment in such action or proceeding, or by one or more orders\\nfrom time to time before or subsequent to final judgment, or by both\\nsuch order or orders and the final judgment. Such direction may be made\\nnotwithstanding that the court for any reason whatsoever, other than\\nlack of jurisdiction, refuses to grant the relief requested in the\\naction or proceeding. Any order or judgment made as in this section\\nprovided may combine in one lump sum any amount payable to the custodial\\nparent under this section with any amount payable to such parent under\\nsection two hundred thirty-six of this article. Upon the application of\\neither parent, or of any other person or party having the care, custody\\nand control of such child pursuant to such judgment or order, after such\\nnotice to the other party, parties or persons having such care, custody\\nand control and given in such manner as the court shall direct, the\\ncourt may annul or modify any such direction, whether made by order or\\nfinal judgment, or in case no such direction shall have been made in the\\nfinal judgment may, with respect to any judgment of annulment or\\ndeclaring the nullity of a void marriage rendered on or after September\\nfirst, nineteen hundred forty, or any judgment of separation or divorce\\nwhenever rendered, amend the judgment by inserting such direction.\\nSubject to the provisions of section two hundred forty-four of this\\narticle, no such modification or annulment shall reduce or annul arrears\\naccrued prior to the making of such application unless the defaulting\\nparty shows good cause for failure to make application for relief from\\nthe judgment or order directing such payment prior to the accrual of\\nsuch arrears. Such modification may increase such child support nunc pro\\ntunc as of the date of application based on newly discovered evidence.\\nAny retroactive amount of child support due shall be support\\narrears/past due support and shall be paid in one lump sum or periodic\\nsums, as the court shall direct, taking into account any amount of\\ntemporary child support which has been paid. In addition, such\\nretroactive child support shall be enforceable in any manner provided by\\nlaw including, but not limited to, an execution for support enforcement\\npursuant to subdivision (b) of section fifty-two hundred forty-one of\\nthe civil practice law and rules.\\n  1-a. In any proceeding brought pursuant to this section to determine\\nthe custody or visitation of minors, a report made to the statewide\\ncentral register of child abuse and maltreatment, pursuant to title six\\nof article six of the social services law, or a portion thereof, which\\nis otherwise admissible as a business record pursuant to rule forty-five\\nhundred eighteen of the civil practice law and rules shall not be\\nadmissible in evidence, notwithstanding such rule, unless an\\ninvestigation of such report conducted pursuant to title six of article\\nsix of the social services law has determined that there is some\\ncredible evidence of the alleged abuse or maltreatment and that the\\nsubject of the report has been notified that the report is indicated. In\\naddition, if such report has been reviewed by the state commissioner of\\nsocial services or his designee and has been determined to be unfounded,\\nit shall not be admissible in evidence. If such report has been so\\nreviewed and has been amended to delete any finding, each such deleted\\nfinding shall not be admissible. If the state commissioner of social\\nservices or his designee has amended the report to add any new finding,\\neach such new finding, together with any portion of the original report\\nnot deleted by the commissioner or his designee, shall be admissible if\\nit meets the other requirements of this subdivision and is otherwise\\nadmissible as a business record. If such a report, or portion thereof,\\nis admissible in evidence but is uncorroborated, it shall not be\\nsufficient to make a fact finding of abuse or maltreatment in such\\nproceeding. Any other evidence tending to support the reliability of\\nsuch report shall be sufficient corroboration.\\n  1-b. (a) The court shall make its award for child support pursuant to\\nthe provisions of this subdivision. The court may vary from the amount\\nof the basic child support obligation determined pursuant to paragraph\\n(c) of this subdivision only in accordance with paragraph (f) of this\\nsubdivision.\\n  (b) For purposes of this subdivision, the following definitions shall\\nbe used:\\n  (1) \"Basic child support obligation\" shall mean the sum derived by\\nadding the amounts determined by the application of subparagraphs two\\nand three of paragraph (c) of this subdivision except as increased\\npursuant to subparagraphs four, five, six and seven of such paragraph.\\n  (2) \"Child support\" shall mean a sum to be paid pursuant to court\\norder or decree by either or both parents or pursuant to a valid\\nagreement between the parties for care, maintenance and education of any\\nunemancipated child under the age of twenty-one years.\\n  (3) \"Child support percentage\" shall mean:\\n  (i) seventeen percent of the combined parental income for one child;\\n  (ii) twenty-five percent of the combined parental income for two\\nchildren;\\n  (iii) twenty-nine percent of the combined parental income for three\\nchildren;\\n  (iv) thirty-one percent of the combined parental income for four\\nchildren; and\\n  (v) no less than thirty-five percent of the combined parental income\\nfor five or more children.\\n  (4) \"Combined parental income\" shall mean the sum of the income of\\nboth parents.\\n  (5) \"Income\" shall mean, but shall not be limited to, the sum of the\\namounts determined by the application of clauses (i), (ii), (iii), (iv),\\n(v) and (vi) of this subparagraph reduced by the amount determined by\\nthe application of clause (vii) of this subparagraph:\\n  (i) gross (total) income as should have been or should be reported in\\nthe most recent federal income tax return.

In an action or\\nproceeding to modify an order of child support, including an order\\nincorporating without merging an agreement, issued prior to the\\neffective date of this subclause, the provisions of this subclause shall\\nnot, by themselves, constitute a substantial change of circumstances\\npursuant to paragraph b of subdivision nine of part B of section two\\nhundred thirty-six of this article.\\n  (iv) at the discretion of the court, the court may attribute or impute\\nincome from, such other resources as may be available to the parent,\\nincluding, but not limited to:\\n  (A) non-income producing assets,\\n  (B) meals, lodging, memberships, automobiles or other perquisites that\\nare provided as part of compensation for employment to the extent that\\nsuch perquisites constitute expenditures for personal use, or which\\nexpenditures directly or indirecly confer personal economic benefits,\\n  (C) fringe benefits provided as part of compensation for employment,\\nand\\n  (D) money, goods, or services provided by relatives and friends;\\n  (v) an amount imputed as income based upon the parent's former\\nresources or income, if the court determines that a parent has reduced\\nresources or income in order to reduce or avoid the parent's obligation\\nfor child support; provided that incarceration shall not be considered\\nvoluntary unemployment, unless such incarceration is the result of\\nnon-payment of a child support order, or an offense against the\\ncustodial parent or child who is the subject of the order or judgment;\\n  (vi) to the extent not already included in gross income in clauses (i)\\nand (ii) of this subparagraph, the following self-employment deductions\\nattributable to self-employment carried on by the taxpayer:\\n  (A) any depreciation deduction greater than depreciation calculated on\\na straight-line basis for the purpose of determining business income or\\ninvestment credits, and\\n  (B) entertainment and travel allowances deducted from business income\\nto the extent said allowances reduce personal expenditures;\\n  (vii) the following shall be deducted from income prior to applying\\nthe provisions of paragraph (c) of this subdivision:\\n  (A) unreimbursed employee business expenses except to the extent said\\nexpenses reduce personal expenditures,\\n  (B) alimony or maintenance actually paid to a spouse not a party to\\nthe instant action pursuant to court order or validly executed written\\nagreement,\\n  (C) alimony or maintenance actually paid or to be paid to a spouse who\\nis a party to the instant action pursuant to an existing court order or\\ncontained in the order to be entered by the court, or pursuant to a\\nvalidly executed written agreement, in which event the order or\\nagreement shall provide for a specific adjustment, in accordance with\\nthis subdivision, in the amount of child support payable upon the\\ntermination of alimony or maintenance to such spouse; provided, however,\\nthat the specific adjustment in the amount of child support is without\\nprejudice to either party's right to seek a modification in accordance\\nwith subparagraph two of paragraph b of subdivision nine of part B of\\nsection two hundred thirty-six of this article. In an action or\\nproceeding to modify an order of child support, including an order\\nincorporating without merging an agreement, issued prior to the\\neffective date of this subclause, the provisions of this subclause shall\\nnot, by themselves, constitute a substantial change of circumstances\\npursuant to paragraph b of subdivision nine of part B of section two\\nhundred thirty-six of this article.\\n  (D) child support actually paid pursuant to court order or written\\nagreement on behalf of any child for whom the parent has a legal duty of\\nsupport and who is not subject to the instant action,\\n  (E) public assistance,\\n  (F) supplemental security income,\\n  (G) New York city or Yonkers income or earnings taxes actually paid,\\nand\\n  (H) federal insurance contributions act (FICA) taxes actually paid.\\n  (6) \"Self-support reserve\" shall mean one hundred thirty-five percent\\nof the poverty income guidelines amount for a single person as reported\\nby the federal department of health and human services. For the calendar\\nyear nineteen hundred eighty-nine, the self-support reserve shall be\\neight thousand sixty-five dollars.

The court shall separately state the non-custodial parent's\\nmonthly obligation. The non-custodial parent's cash medical support\\nobligation under this clause shall not exceed five percent of his or her\\ngross income, or the difference between the non-custodial parent's\\nincome and the self-support reserve, whichever is less.\\n  (B) In the case of a child or children authorized for fee-for-service\\ncoverage under the medical assistance program other than a child or\\nchildren described in item (A) of this clause, the court shall determine\\nthe non-custodial parent's maximum annual cash medical support\\nobligation, which shall be equal to the lesser of the monthly amount\\nthat would be required as a family contribution under the state's child\\nhealth insurance plan pursuant to title one-A of article twenty-five of\\nthe public health law for the child or children if they were in a\\ntwo-parent household with income equal to the combined income of the\\nnon-custodial and custodial parents times twelve months or the number of\\nmonths that the child or children are authorized for fee-for-service\\ncoverage during any year. The court shall separately state in the order\\nthe non-custodial parent's maximum annual cash medical support\\nobligation and, upon proof to the court that the non-custodial parent,\\nafter notice of the amount due, has failed to pay the public entity for\\nincurred health care expenses, the court shall order the non-custodial\\nparent to pay such incurred health care expenses up to the maximum\\nannual cash medical support obligation. Such amounts shall be support\\narrears/past due support and shall be subject to any remedies as\\nprovided by law for the enforcement of support arrears/past due support.\\nThe total annual amount that the non-custodial parent is ordered to pay\\nunder this clause shall not exceed five percent of his or her gross\\nincome or the difference between the non-custodial parent's income and\\nthe self-support reserve, whichever is less.\\n  (C) The court shall order cash medical support to be paid by the\\nnon-custodial parent for health care expenses of the child or children\\npaid by the medical assistance program prior to the issuance of the\\ncourt's order. The amount of such support shall be calculated as\\nprovided under item (A) or (B) of this clause, provided that the amount\\nthat the non-custodial parent is ordered to pay under this item shall\\nnot exceed five percent of his or her gross income or the difference\\nbetween the non-custodial parent's income and the self-support reserve,\\nwhichever is less, for the year when the expense was incurred. Such\\namounts shall be support arrears/past due support and shall be subject\\nto any remedies as provided by law for the enforcement of support\\narrears/past due support.\\n  (iv) Where health insurance benefits pursuant to subparagraph one and\\nclauses (i) and (ii) of subparagraph two of paragraph (c) of subdivision\\none of this section are determined by the court to be unavailable, and\\nthe child or children are determined eligible for coverage under the\\nstate's child health insurance plan pursuant to title one-A of article\\ntwenty-five of the public health law, the court shall prorate each\\nparent's share of the cost of the family contribution required under\\nsuch child health insurance plan in the same proportion as each parent's\\nincome is to the combined parental income, and state the amount of the\\nnon-custodial parent's share in the order. The total amount of cash\\nmedical support that the non-custodial parent is ordered to pay under\\nthis clause shall not exceed five percent of his or her gross income, or\\nthe difference between the non-custodial parent's income and the\\nself-support reserve, whichever is less.\\n  (v) In addition to the amounts ordered under clause (ii), (iii), or\\n(iv), the court shall pro rate each parent's share of reasonable health\\ncare expenses not reimbursed or paid by insurance, the medical\\nassistance program established pursuant to title eleven of article five\\nof the social services law, or the state's child health insurance plan\\npursuant to title one-A of article twenty-five of the public health law,\\nin the same proportion as each parent's income is to the combined\\nparental income, and state the non-custodial parent's share as a\\npercentage in the order. The non-custodial parent's pro rata share of\\nsuch health care expenses determined by the court to be due and owing\\nshall be support arrears/past due support and shall be subject to any\\nremedies provided by law for the enforcement of support arrears/past due\\nsupport. In addition, the court may direct that the non-custodial\\nparent's pro rata share of such health care expenses be paid in one sum\\nor in periodic sums, including direct payment to the health care\\nprovider.\\n  (vi) Upon proof by either party that cash medical support pursuant to\\nclause (ii), (iii), (iv), or (v) of this subparagraph would be unjust or\\ninappropriate pursuant to paragraph (f) of this subdivision, the court\\nshall:\\n  (A) order the parties to pay cash medical support as the court finds\\njust and appropriate, considering the best interests of the child; and\\n  (B) set forth in the order the factors it considered, the amount\\ncalculated under this subparagraph, the reason or reasons the court did\\nnot order such amount, and the basis for the amount awarded.\\n  (6) Where the court determines that the custodial parent is seeking\\nwork and incurs child care expenses as a result thereof, the court may\\ndetermine reasonable child care expenses and may apportion the same\\nbetween the custodial and non-custodial parent. The non-custodial\\nparent's share of such expenses shall be separately stated and paid in a\\nmanner determined by the court.\\n  (7) Where the court determines, having regard for the circumstances of\\nthe case and of the respective parties and in the best interests of the\\nchild, and as justice requires, that the present or future provision of\\npost-secondary, private, special, or enriched education for the child is\\nappropriate, the court may award educational expenses. The non-custodial\\nparent shall pay educational expenses, as awarded, in a manner\\ndetermined by the court, including direct payment to the educational\\nprovider.\\n  (d) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (c) of this\\nsubdivision, where the annual amount of the basic child support\\nobligation would reduce the non-custodial parent's income below the\\npoverty income guidelines amount for a single person as reported by the\\nfederal department of health and human services, the basic child support\\nobligation shall be twenty-five dollars per month, provided, however,\\nthat if the court finds that such basic child support obligation is\\nunjust or inappropriate, which finding shall be based upon\\nconsiderations of the factors set forth in paragraph (f) of this\\nsubdivision, the court shall order the non-custodial parent to pay such\\namount of the child support as the court finds just and appropriate.\\nNotwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (c) of this subdivision,\\nwhere the annual amount of the basic child support obligation would\\nreduce the non-custodial parent's income below the self-support reserve\\nbut not below the poverty income guidelines amount for a single person\\nas reported by the federal department of health and human services, the\\nbasic child support obligation shall be fifty dollars per month or the\\ndifference between the non-custodial parent's income and the\\nself-support reserve, whichever is greater, in addition to any amounts\\nthat the court may, in its discretion, order in accordance with\\nsubparagraphs four, five, six and/or seven of paragraph (c) of this\\nsubdivision.\\n  (e) Where a parent is or may be entitled to receive non-recurring\\npayments from extraordinary sources not otherwise considered as income\\npursuant to this section, including but not limited to:\\n  (1) Life insurance policies;\\n  (2) Discharges of indebtedness;\\n  (3) Recovery of bad debts and delinquency amounts;\\n  (4) Gifts and inheritances; and\\n  (5) Lottery winnings,\\nthe court, in accordance with paragraphs (c), (d) and (f) of this\\nsubdivision may allocate a proportion of the same to child support, and\\nsuch amount shall be paid in a manner determined by the court.\\n  (f) The court shall calculate the basic child support obligation, and\\nthe non-custodial parent's pro rata share of the basic child support\\nobligation. Unless the court finds that the non-custodial parents's\\npro-rata share of the basic child support obligation is unjust or\\ninappropriate, which finding shall be based upon consideration of the\\nfollowing factors:\\n  (1) The financial resources of the custodial and non-custodial parent,\\nand those of the child;\\n  (2) The physical and emotional health of the child and his/her special\\nneeds and aptitudes;\\n  (3) The standard of living the child would have enjoyed had the\\nmarriage or household not been dissolved;\\n  (4) The tax consequences to the parties;\\n  (5) The non-monetary contributions that the parents will make toward\\nthe care and well-being of the child;\\n  (6) The educational needs of either parent;\\n  (7) A determination that the gross income of one parent is\\nsubstantially less than the other parent's gross income;\\n  (8) The needs of the children of the non-custodial parent for whom the\\nnon-custodial parent is providing support who are not subject to the\\ninstant action and whose support has not been deducted from income\\npursuant to subclause (D) of clause (vii) of subparagraph five of\\nparagraph (b) of this subdivision, and the financial resources of any\\nperson obligated to support such children, provided, however, that this\\nfactor may apply only if the resources available to support such\\nchildren are less than the resources available to support the children\\nwho are subject to the instant action;\\n  (9) Provided that the child is not on public assistance (i)\\nextraordinary expenses incurred by the non-custodial parent in\\nexercising visitation, or (ii) expenses incurred by the non-custodial\\nparent in extended visitation provided that the custodial parent's\\nexpenses are substantially reduced as a result thereof; and\\n  (10) Any other factors the court determines are relevant in each case,\\nthe court shall order the non-custodial parent to pay his or her pro\\nrata share of the basic child support obligation, and may order the\\nnon-custodial parent to pay an amount pursuant to paragraph (e) of this\\nsubdivision.\\n  (g) Where the court finds that the non-custodial parent's pro rata\\nshare of the basic child support obligation is unjust or inappropriate,\\nthe court shall order the non-custodial parent to pay such amount of\\nchild support as the court finds just and appropriate, and the court\\nshall set forth, in a written order, the factors it considered; the\\namount of each party's pro rata share of the basic child support\\nobligation; and the reasons that the court did not order the basic child\\nsupport obligation. Such written order may not be waived by either party\\nor counsel; provided, however, and notwithstanding any other provision\\nof law, the court shall not find that the non-custodial parent's pro\\nrata share of such obligation is unjust or inappropriate on the basis\\nthat such share exceeds the portion of a public assistance grant which\\nis attributable to a child or children. Where the non-custodial parent's\\nincome is less than or equal to the poverty income guidelines amount for\\na single person as reported by the federal department of health and\\nhuman services, unpaid child support arrears in excess of five hundred\\ndollars shall not accrue.\\n  (h) A validly executed agreement or stipulation voluntarily entered\\ninto between the parties after the effective date of this subdivision\\npresented to the court for incorporation in an order or judgment shall\\ninclude a provision stating that the parties have been advised of the\\nprovisions of this subdivision, and that the basic child support\\nobligation provided for therein would presumptively result in the\\ncorrect amount of child support to be awarded. In the event that such\\nagreement or stipulation deviates from the basic child support\\nobligation, the agreement or stipulation must specify the amount that\\nsuch basic child support obligation would have been and the reason or\\nreasons that such agreement or stipulation does not provide for payment\\nof that amount. Such provision may not be waived by either party or\\ncounsel. Nothing contained in this subdivision shall be construed to\\nalter the rights of the parties to voluntarily enter into validly\\nexecuted agreements or stipulations which deviate from the basic child\\nsupport obligation provided such agreements or stipulations comply with\\nthe provisions of this paragraph. The court shall, however, retain\\ndiscretion with respect to child support pursuant to this section. Any\\ncourt order or judgment incorporating a validly executed agreement or\\nstipulation which deviates from the basic child support obligation shall\\nset forth the court's reasons for such deviation.\\n  (i) Where either or both parties are unrepresented, the court shall\\nnot enter an order or judgment other than a temporary order pursuant to\\nsection two hundred thirty-seven of this article, that includes a\\nprovision for child support unless the unrepresented party or parties\\nhave received a copy of the child support standards chart promulgated by\\nthe commissioner of the office of temporary and disability assistance\\npursuant to subdivision two of section one hundred eleven-i of the\\nsocial services law. Where either party is in receipt of child support\\nenforcement services through the local social services district, the\\nlocal social services district child support enforcement unit shall\\nadvise such party of the amount derived from application of the child\\nsupport percentage and that such amount serves as a starting point for\\nthe determination of the child support award, and shall provide such\\nparty with a copy of the child support standards chart.\\n  (j) In addition to financial disclosure required in section two\\nhundred thirty-six of this article, the court may require that the\\nincome and/or expenses of either party be verified with documentation\\nincluding, but not limited to, past and present income tax returns,\\nemployer statements, pay stubs, corporate, business, or partnership\\nbooks and records, corporate and business tax returns, and receipts for\\nexpenses or such other means of verification as the court determines\\nappropriate.  Nothing herein shall affect any party's right to pursue\\ndiscovery pursuant to this chapter, the civil practice law and rules, or\\nthe family court act.\\n  (k) When a party has defaulted and/or the court is otherwise presented\\nwith insufficient evidence to determine gross income, the court shall\\norder child support based upon the needs or standard of living of the\\nchild, whichever is greater. Such order may be retroactively modified\\nupward, without a showing of change in circumstances.\\n  (l) In any action or proceeding for modification of an order of child\\nsupport existing prior to the effective date of this paragraph, brought\\npursuant to this article, the child support standards set forth in this\\nsubdivision shall not constitute a change of circumstances warranting\\nmodification of such support order; provided, however, that (1) where\\nthe circumstances warrant modification of such order, or (2) where any\\nparty objects to an adjusted child support order made or proposed at the\\ndirection of the support collection unit pursuant to section one hundred\\neleven-h or one hundred eleven-n of the social services law, and the\\ncourt is reviewing the current order of child support, such standards\\nshall be applied by the court in its determination with regard to the\\nrequest for modification, or disposition of an objection to an adjusted\\nchild support order made or proposed by a support collection unit. In\\napplying such standards, when the order to be modified incorporates by\\nreference or merges with a validly executed separation agreement or\\nstipulation of settlement, the court may consider, in addition to the\\nfactors set forth in paragraph (f) of this subdivision, the provisions\\nof such agreement or stipulation concerning property distribution,\\ndistributive award and/or maintenance in determining whether the amount\\ncalculated by using the standards would be unjust or inappropriate.\\n  1-c. (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter to the\\ncontrary, no court shall make an order providing for visitation or\\ncustody to a person who has been convicted of murder in the first or\\nsecond degree in this state, or convicted of an offense in another\\njurisdiction which, if committed in this state, would constitute either\\nmurder in the first or second degree, of a parent, legal custodian,\\nlegal guardian, sibling, half-sibling or step-sibling of any child who\\nis the subject of the proceeding. Pending determination of a petition\\nfor visitation or custody, such child shall not visit and no person\\nshall visit with such child present, such person who has been convicted\\nof murder in the first or second degree in this state, or convicted of\\nand offense in another jurisdiction which, if committed in this state,\\nwould constitute either murder in the first or second degree, of a\\nparent, legal custodian, legal guardian, sibling, half-sibling or\\nstep-sibling of a child who is the subject of the proceeding without the\\nconsent of such child's custodian or legal guardian.\\n  (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter to the\\ncontrary, there shall be a rebuttable presumption that it is not in the\\nbest interests of the child to:\\n  (A) be placed in the custody of or to visit with a person who has been\\nconvicted of one or more of the following sexual offenses in this state\\nor convicted of one or more offenses in another jurisdiction which, if\\ncommitted in this state, would constitute one or more of the following\\noffenses, when a child who is the subject of the proceeding was\\nconceived as a result:\\n  (1) rape in the first or second degree;\\n  (2) course of sexual conduct against a child in the first degree;\\n  (3) predatory sexual assault; or\\n  (4) predatory sexual assault against a child; or\\n  (B) be placed in the custody of or have unsupervised visits with a\\nperson who has been convicted of a felony sex offense, as defined in\\nsection 70.80 of the penal law, or convicted of an offense in another\\njurisdiction which, if committed in this state, would constitute such a\\nfelony sex offense, where the victim of such offense was the child who\\nis the subject of the proceeding.\\n  (c) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) or (b) of this subdivision a court\\nmay order visitation or custody where:\\n  (i) (A) such child is of suitable age to signify assent and such child\\nassents to such visitation or custody; or\\n  (B) if such child is not of suitable age to signify assent, the\\nchild's custodian or legal guardian assents to such order; or\\n  (C) the person who has been convicted of murder in the first or second\\ndegree, or an offense in another jurisdiction which if committed in this\\nstate, would constitute either murder in the first or second degree, can\\nprove by a preponderance of the evidence that:\\n  (1) he or she, or a family or household member of either party, was a\\nvictim of domestic violence by the victim of such murder; and\\n  (2) the domestic violence was causally related to the commission of\\nsuch murder;\\n  (ii) and the court finds that such visitation or custody is in the\\nbest interests of the child.\\n  (d) For the purpose of making a determination pursuant to clause (C)\\nof subparagraph (i) of paragraph (c) of this subdivision, the court\\nshall not be bound by the findings of fact, conclusions of law or\\nultimate conclusion as determined by the proceedings leading to the\\nconviction of murder in the first or second degree in this state or of\\nan offense in another jurisdiction which, if committed in this state,\\nwould constitute murder in either the first or second degree, of a\\nparent, legal guardian, legal custodian, sibling, half-sibling or\\nstep-sibling of a child who is the subject of the proceeding. In all\\nproceedings under this section, an attorney shall be appointed for the\\nchild.\\n  2. (a) An order directing payment of money for child support shall be\\nenforceable pursuant to section fifty-two hundred forty-one or fifty-two\\nhundred forty-two of the civil practice law and rules or in any other\\nmanner provided by law. Such orders or judgments for child support and\\nmaintenance shall also be enforceable pursuant to article fifty-two of\\nthe civil practice law and rules upon a debtor's default as such term is\\ndefined in paragraph seven of subdivision (a) of section fifty-two\\nhundred forty-one of the civil practice law and rules. The establishment\\nof a default shall be subject to the procedures established for the\\ndetermination of a mistake of fact for income executions pursuant to\\nsubdivision (e) of section fifty-two hundred forty-one of the civil\\npractice law and rules. For the purposes of enforcement of child support\\norders or combined spousal and child support orders pursuant to section\\nfive thousand two hundred forty-one of the civil practice law and rules,\\na \"default\" shall be deemed to include amounts arising from retroactive\\nsupport.\\n  b. (1) When a child receiving support is a public assistance\\nrecipient, or the order of support is being enforced or is to be\\nenforced pursuant to section one hundred eleven-g of the social services\\nlaw, the court shall direct that the child support payments be made to\\nthe support collection unit. Unless (i) the court finds and sets forth\\nin writing the reasons that there is good cause not to require immediate\\nincome withholding; or (ii) when the child is not in receipt of public\\nassistance, a written agreement providing for an alternative arrangement\\nhas been reached between the parties, the support collection unit shall\\nissue an income execution immediately for child support or combined\\nmaintenance and child support, and may issue an execution for medical\\nsupport enforcement in accordance with the provisions of the order of\\nsupport. Such written agreement may include an oral stipulation made on\\nthe record resulting in a written order. For purposes of this paragraph,\\ngood cause shall mean substantial harm to the debtor. The absence of an\\narrearage or the mere issuance of an income execution shall not\\nconstitute good cause. When an immediate income execution or an\\nexecution for medical support enforcement is issued by the support\\ncollection unit, such income execution shall be issued pursuant to\\nsection five thousand two hundred forty-one of the civil practice law\\nand rules, except that the provisions thereof relating to mistake of\\nfact, default and any other provisions which are not relevant to the\\nissuance of an income execution pursuant to this paragraph shall not\\napply; provided, however, that if the support collection unit makes an\\nerror in the issuance of an income execution pursuant to this paragraph,\\nand such error is to the detriment of the debtor, the support collection\\nunit shall have thirty days after notification by the debtor to correct\\nthe error. Where permitted under federal law and where the record of the\\nproceedings contains such information, such order shall include on its\\nface the social security number and the name and address of the\\nemployer, if any, of the person chargeable with support; provided,\\nhowever, that failure to comply with this requirement shall not\\ninvalidate such order. When the court determines that there is good\\ncause not to immediately issue an income execution or when the parties\\nagree to an alternative arrangement as provided in this paragraph, the\\ncourt shall provide expressly in the order of support that the support\\ncollection unit shall not issue an immediate income execution.\\nNotwithstanding any such order, the support collection unit shall issue\\nan income execution for support enforcement when the debtor defaults on\\nthe support obligation, as defined in section five thousand two hundred\\nforty-one of the civil practice law and rules.\\n  (2) When the court issues an order of child support or combined child\\nand spousal support on behalf of persons other than those in receipt of\\npublic assistance or in receipt of services pursuant to section one\\nhundred eleven-g of the social services law, the court shall issue an\\nincome deduction order pursuant to subdivision (c) of section five\\nthousand two hundred forty-two of the civil practice law and rules at\\nthe same time it issues the order of support. The court shall enter the\\nincome deduction order unless the court finds and sets forth in writing\\n(i) the reasons that there is good cause not to require immediate income\\nwithholding; or (ii) that an agreement providing for an alternative\\narrangement has been reached between the parties. Such agreement may\\ninclude a written agreement or an oral stipulation, made on the record,\\nthat results in a written order. For purposes of this paragraph, good\\ncause shall mean substantial harm to the debtor. The absence of an\\narrearage or the mere issuance of an income deduction order shall not\\nconstitute good cause. Where permitted under federal law and where the\\nrecord of the proceedings contains such information, such order shall\\ninclude on its face the social security number and the name and address\\nof the employer, if any, of the person chargeable with support;\\nprovided, however, that failure to comply with this requirement shall\\nnot invalidate the order. When the court determines that there is good\\ncause not to issue an income deduction order immediately or when the\\nparties agree to an alternative arrangement as provided in this\\nparagraph, the court shall provide expressly in the order of support the\\nbasis for its decision and shall not issue an income deduction order.\\n  c. Any order of support issued on behalf of a child in receipt of\\nfamily assistance or child support enforcement services pursuant to\\nsection one hundred eleven-g of the social services law shall be subject\\nto review and adjustment by the support collection unit pursuant to\\nsection one hundred eleven-n of the social services law. Such review and\\nadjustment shall be in addition to any other activities undertaken by\\nthe support collection unit relating to the establishment, modification,\\nand enforcement of support orders payable to such unit.\\n  3. Order of protection.  a. The court may make an order of protection\\nin assistance or as a condition of any other order made under this\\nsection. The order of protection may set forth reasonable conditions of\\nbehavior to be observed for a specified time by any party. Such an order\\nmay require any party:\\n  (1) to stay away from the home, school, business or place of\\nemployment of the child, other parent or any other party, and to stay\\naway from any other specific location designated by the court;\\n  (2) to permit a parent, or a person entitled to visitation by a court\\norder or a separation agreement, to visit the child at stated periods;\\n  (3) to refrain from committing a family offense, as defined in\\nsubdivision one of section 530.11 of the criminal procedure law, or any\\ncriminal offense against the child or against the other parent or\\nagainst any person to whom custody of the child is awarded or from\\nharassing, intimidating or threatening such persons;\\n  (4) to permit a designated party to enter the residence during a\\nspecified period of time in order to remove personal belongings not in\\nissue in a proceeding or action under this chapter or the family court\\nact;\\n  (5) to refrain from acts of commission or omission that create an\\nunreasonable risk to the health, safety or welfare of a child;\\n  (6) to pay the reasonable counsel fees and disbursements involved in\\nobtaining or enforcing the order of the person who is protected by such\\norder if such order is issued or enforced;\\n  (7) to refrain from intentionally injuring or killing, without\\njustification, any companion animal the respondent knows to be owned,\\npossessed, leased, kept or held by the person protected by the order or\\na minor child residing in such person's household. \"Companion animal,\"\\nas used in this section, shall have the same meaning as in subdivision\\nfive of section three hundred fifty of the agriculture and markets law;\\n  (8) (i) to promptly return specified identification documents to the\\nprotected party, in whose favor the order of protection or temporary\\norder of protection is issued; provided, however, that such order may:\\n(A) include any appropriate provision designed to ensure that any such\\ndocument is available for use as evidence in this proceeding, and\\navailable if necessary for legitimate use by the party against whom such\\norder is issued; and (B) specify the manner in which such return shall\\nbe accomplished.\\n  (ii) For purposes of this subparagraph, \"identification document\"\\nshall mean any of the following: (A) exclusively in the name of the\\nprotected party: birth certificate, passport, social security card,\\nhealth insurance or other benefits card, a card or document used to\\naccess bank, credit or other financial accounts or records, tax returns,\\nany driver's license, and immigration documents including but not\\nlimited to a United States permanent resident card and employment\\nauthorization document; and (B) upon motion and after notice and an\\nopportunity to be heard, any of the following, including those that may\\nreflect joint use or ownership, that the court determines are necessary\\nand are appropriately transferred to the protected party: any card or\\ndocument used to access bank, credit or other financial accounts or\\nrecords, tax returns, and any other identifying cards and documents; and\\n  (9) to observe such other conditions as are necessary to further the\\npurposes of protection.\\n  a-1. Translation and interpretation of orders of protection. The\\noffice of court administration shall, in accordance with paragraph (t)\\nof subdivision two of section two hundred twelve of the judiciary law,\\nensure that a court order of protection and temporary order of\\nprotection is translated in writing into the appropriate language for a\\nparty to a proceeding where the court has appointed an interpreter. The\\noffice of court administration shall ensure that the standard language\\nof the office of court administration order of protection and temporary\\norder of protection forms shall be translated in writing in the\\nlanguages most frequently used in the courts of each judicial department\\nin accordance with paragraph (t) of subdivision two of section two\\nhundred twelve of the judiciary law. A copy of the written translation\\nshall be given to each party in the proceeding, along with the original\\norder or temporary order of protection issued in English. A copy of this\\nwritten translation shall also be included as part of the record of the\\nproceeding. The court shall read the essential terms and conditions of\\nthe order aloud on the record and direct the court appointed interpreter\\nto interpret the same terms and conditions. Such written translation or\\ninterpretation shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the\\norder. In every case a party to a proceeding shall be provided with an\\nEnglish copy of any court order of protection or temporary order of\\nprotection issued. The authority provided herein shall be in addition to\\nand shall not be deemed to diminish or reduce any rights of the parties\\nunder existing law.\\n  b. An order of protection entered pursuant to this subdivision shall\\nbear in a conspicuous manner, on the front page of said order, the\\nlanguage \"Order of protection issued pursuant to section two hundred\\nforty of the domestic relations law\". The order of protection shall also\\ncontain the following notice: \"This order of protection will remain in\\neffect even if the protected party has, or consents to have, contact or\\ncommunication with the party against whom the order is issued. This\\norder of protection can only be modified or terminated by the court. The\\nprotected party cannot be held to violate this order nor be arrested for\\nviolating this order.\". The absence of such language shall not affect\\nthe validity of such order. The presentation of a copy of such an order\\nto any peace officer acting pursuant to his or her special duties, or\\npolice officer, shall constitute authority, for that officer to arrest a\\nperson when that person has violated the terms of such an order, and\\nbring such person before the court and, otherwise, so far as lies within\\nthe officer's power, to aid in securing the protection such order was\\nintended to afford.\\n  c. An order of protection entered pursuant to this subdivision may be\\nmade in the final judgment in any matrimonial action or in a proceeding\\nto obtain custody of or visitation with any child under this section, or\\nby one or more orders from time to time before or subsequent to final\\njudgment, or by both such order or orders and the final judgment. The\\norder of protection may remain in effect after entry of a final\\nmatrimonial judgment and during the minority of any child whose custody\\nor visitation is the subject of a provision of a final judgment or any\\norder. An order of protection may be entered notwithstanding that the\\ncourt for any reason whatsoever, other than lack of jurisdiction,\\nrefuses to grant the relief requested in the action or proceeding.\\n  d. The chief administrator of the courts shall promulgate appropriate\\nuniform temporary orders of protection and orders of protection forms,\\napplicable to proceedings under this article, to be used throughout the\\nstate. Such forms shall be promulgated and developed in a manner to\\nensure the compatibility of such forms with the statewide computerized\\nregistry established pursuant to section two hundred twenty-one-a of the\\nexecutive law.\\n  e. No order of protection may direct any party to observe conditions\\nof behavior unless: (i) the party requesting the order of protection has\\nserved and filed an action, proceeding, counter-claim or written motion\\nand, (ii) the court has made a finding on the record that such party is\\nentitled to issuance of the order of protection which may result from a\\njudicial finding of fact, judicial acceptance of an admission by the\\nparty against whom the order was issued or judicial finding that the\\nparty against whom the order is issued has given knowing, intelligent\\nand voluntary consent to its issuance. The provisions of this\\nsubdivision shall not preclude the court from issuing a temporary order\\nof protection upon the court's own motion or where a motion for such\\nrelief is made to the court, for good cause shown. In any proceeding\\npursuant to this article, a court shall not deny an order of protection,\\nor dismiss an application for such an order, solely on the basis that\\nthe acts or events alleged are not relatively contemporaneous with the\\ndate of the application or the conclusion of the action. The duration of\\nany temporary order shall not by itself be a factor in determining the\\nlength or issuance of any final order.\\n  f. In addition to the foregoing provisions, the court may issue an\\norder, pursuant to section two hundred twenty-seven-c of the real\\nproperty law, authorizing the party for whose benefit any order of\\nprotection has been issued to terminate a lease or rental agreement\\npursuant to section two hundred twenty-seven-c of the real property law.\\n  g. Any party moving for a temporary order of protection pursuant to\\nthis subdivision during hours when the court is open shall be entitled\\nto file such motion or pleading containing such prayer for emergency\\nrelief on the same day that such person first appears at such court, and\\na hearing on the motion or portion of the pleading requesting such\\nemergency relief shall be held on the same day or the next day that the\\ncourt is in session following the filing of such motion or pleading.\\n  h.

Upon issuance of an\\norder of protection pursuant to this section or upon a finding of a\\nviolation thereof, the court also may direct payment of restitution in\\nan amount not to exceed ten thousand dollars in accordance with\\nsubdivision (e) of section eight hundred forty-one of such act;\\nprovided, however, that in no case shall an order of restitution be\\nissued where the court determines that the party against whom the order\\nwould be issued has already compensated the injured party or where such\\ncompensation is incorporated in a final judgment or settlement of the\\naction.\\n  i. The protected party in whose favor the order of protection or\\ntemporary order of protection is issued may not be held to violate such\\nan order nor may such protected party be arrested for violating such\\norder.\\n  * 3-a. Service of order of protection. a. If a temporary order of\\nprotection has been issued or an order of protection has been issued\\nupon a default, unless the party requesting the order states on the\\nrecord that she or he will arrange for other means for service or\\ndeliver the order to a peace or police officer directly for service, the\\ncourt shall immediately deliver a copy of the temporary order of\\nprotection or order of protection to a peace officer, acting pursuant to\\nhis or her special duties and designated by the court, or to a police\\nofficer as defined in paragraph (b) or (d) of subdivision thirty-four of\\nsection 1.20 of the criminal procedure law, or, in the city of New York,\\nto a designated representative of the police department of the city of\\nNew York. Any peace or police officer or designated person receiving a\\ntemporary order of protection or an order of protection as provided\\nhereunder shall serve or provide for the service thereof together with\\nany associated papers that may be served simultaneously, at any address\\ndesignated therewith, including the summons and petition or complaint if\\nnot previously served. Service of such temporary order of protection or\\norder of protection and associated papers shall, insofar as practicable,\\nbe achieved promptly. An officer or designated person obliged to perform\\nservice pursuant to this subdivision, and his or her employer, shall not\\nbe liable for damages resulting from failure to achieve service where,\\nhaving made a reasonable effort, such officer or designated person is\\nunable to locate and serve the temporary order of protection or order of\\nprotection at any address provided by the party requesting the order.

Any readjusted order so\\nissued by the court or resubmitted by the support collection unit after\\na remand by the court shall be effective as of the date the proposed\\nadjusted order would have been effective had no specific written\\nobjections been filed.\\n  (d) If the court finds that the specific written objections have not\\nbeen proven by a preponderance of the evidence, the court shall\\nimmediately issue the adjusted order as submitted by the support\\ncollection unit, which shall be effective as of the date the order would\\nhave been effective had no specific written exceptions been filed.\\n  (e) If the court receives no specific written objections to the\\nsupport order within thirty-five days of the mailing of the proposed\\norder the clerk of the court shall immediately enter the order without\\nfurther review, modification, or other prior action by the court or any\\njudge or support magistrate thereof, and the clerk shall immediately\\ntransmit copies of the order of support to the parties and to the\\nsupport collection unit.\\n  (2) A motion to vacate an order of support adjusted pursuant to this\\nsection may be made no later than forty-five days after an adjusted\\nsupport order is executed by the court where no specific written\\nobjections to the proposed order have been timely received by the court.\\nSuch motion shall be granted only upon a determination by the court\\nissuing such order that personal jurisdiction was not timely obtained\\nover the moving party.\\n  * 5.

In an action for\\ndivorce, separation or annulment or in an action to declare the nullity\\nof a void marriage in the supreme court, the supreme court or the family\\ncourt shall entertain an application for an order of protection or\\ntemporary order of protection by either party. Such an order may require\\nany party:\\n  (a) to stay away from the home, school, business or place of\\nemployment of the child, other parent or any other party, and to stay\\naway from any other specific location designated by the court;\\n  (b) to permit a parent, or a person entitled to visitation by a court\\norder or a separation agreement, to visit the child at stated periods;\\n  (c) to refrain from committing a family offense, as defined in\\nsubdivision one of section 530.11 of the criminal procedure law, or any\\ncriminal offense against such child or against the other parent or\\nagainst any person to whom custody of the child is awarded or from\\nharassing, intimidating or threatening such persons;\\n  (d) to permit a designated party to enter the residence during a\\nspecified period of time in order to remove personal belongings not in\\nissue in a proceeding or action under this chapter or the family court\\nact;\\n  (e) to refrain from acts of commission or omission that create an\\nunreasonable risk to the health, safety or welfare of a child;\\n  (f) to pay the reasonable counsel fees and disbursements involved in\\nobtaining or enforcing the order of the person who is protected by such\\norder if such order is issued or enforced;\\n  (g) to refrain from intentionally injuring or killing, without\\njustification, any companion animal the respondent knows to be owned,\\npossessed, leased, kept or held by the person protected by the order or\\na minor child residing in such person's household. \"Companion animal,\"\\nas used in this section, shall have the same meaning as in subdivision\\nfive of section three hundred fifty of the agriculture and markets law;\\n  (h) (1) to promptly return specified identification documents to the\\nprotected party, in whose favor the order of protection or temporary\\norder of protection is issued; provided, however, that such order may:\\n(A) include any appropriate provision designed to ensure that any such\\ndocument is available for use as evidence in this proceeding, and\\navailable if necessary for legitimate use by the party against whom such\\norder is issued; and (B) specify the manner in which such return shall\\nbe accomplished.\\n  (2) For purposes of this paragraph, \"identification document\" shall\\nmean any of the following: (A) exclusively in the name of the protected\\nparty: birth certificate, passport, social security card, health\\ninsurance or other benefits card, a card or document used to access\\nbank, credit or other financial accounts or records, tax returns, any\\ndriver's license, and immigration documents including but not limited to\\na United States permanent resident card and employment authorization\\ndocument; and (B) upon motion and after notice and an opportunity to be\\nheard, any of the following, including those that may reflect joint use\\nor ownership, that the court determines are necessary and are\\nappropriately transferred to the protected party: any card or document\\nused to access bank, credit or other financial accounts or records, tax\\nreturns, and any other identifying cards and documents; and\\n  (i) to observe such other conditions as are necessary to further the\\npurposes of protection.\\n  1-a. Translation and interpretation of orders of protection. The\\noffice of court administration shall, in accordance with paragraph (t)\\nof subdivision two of section two hundred twelve of the judiciary law,\\nensure that a court order of protection or temporary order of protection\\nis translated in writing into the appropriate language for a party to a\\nproceeding where the court has appointed an interpreter. The office of\\ncourt administration shall ensure that the standard language of the\\noffice of court administration order of protection and temporary order\\nof protection forms shall be translated in writing in the languages most\\nfrequently used in the courts of each judicial department in accordance\\nwith paragraph (t) of subdivision two of section two hundred twelve of\\nthe judiciary law. A copy of the written translation shall be given to\\neach party in the proceeding, along with the original order or temporary\\norder of protection issued in English. A copy of this written\\ntranslation shall also be included as part of the record of the\\nproceeding. The court shall read the essential terms and conditions of\\nthe order aloud on the record and direct the court appointed interpreter\\nto interpret the same terms and conditions. Such written translation or\\ninterpretation shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the\\norder. In every case a party to a proceeding shall be provided with an\\nEnglish copy of any court order of protection or temporary order of\\nprotection issued. The authority provided herein shall be in addition to\\nand shall not be deemed to diminish or reduce any rights of the parties\\nunder existing law.\\n  2. An order of protection entered pursuant to this subdivision shall\\nbear in a conspicuous manner, on the front page of said order, the\\nlanguage \"Order of protection issued pursuant to section two hundred\\nfifty-two of the domestic relations law\". The order of protection shall\\nalso contain the following notice: \"This order of protection will remain\\nin effect even if the protected party has, or consents to have, contact\\nor communication with the party against whom the order is issued. This\\norder of protection can only be modified or terminated by the court. The\\nprotected party cannot be held to violate this order nor be arrested for\\nviolating this order.\". The absence of such language shall not affect\\nthe validity of such order. The presentation of a copy of such an order\\nto any peace officer acting pursuant to his or her special duties, or\\npolice officer, shall constitute authority, for that officer to arrest a\\nperson when that person has violated the terms of such an order, and\\nbring such person before the court and, otherwise, so far as lies within\\nthe officer's power, to aid in securing the protection such order was\\nintended to afford.\\n  2-a. If the court that issued an order of protection or temporary\\norder of protection under this section or warrant in connection thereto\\nis not in session when an arrest is made for an alleged violation of the\\norder or upon a warrant issued in connection with such violation, the\\narrested person shall be brought before a local criminal court in the\\ncounty of arrest or in the county in which such warrant is returnable\\npursuant to article one hundred twenty of the criminal procedure law and\\narraigned by such court. Such local criminal court shall order the\\ncommitment of the arrested person to the custody of the sheriff, admit\\nto, fix or accept bail, or release the arrested person on his or her\\nrecognizance pending appearance in the court that issued the order of\\nprotection, temporary order of protection or warrant. In making such\\norder, such local criminal court shall consider the bail\\nrecommendations, if any, made by the supreme or family court as\\nindicated on the warrant or certificate of warrant. Unless the\\npetitioner or complainant requests otherwise, the court, in addition to\\nscheduling further criminal proceedings, if any, regarding such alleged\\nfamily offense or violation allegation, shall make such matter\\nreturnable in the supreme or family court, as applicable, on the next\\nday such court is in session.\\n  3. An order of protection entered pursuant to this subdivision may be\\nmade in the final judgment in any matrimonial action, or by one or more\\norders from time to time before or subsequent to final judgment, or by\\nboth such order or orders and the final judgment. The order of\\nprotection may remain in effect after entry of a final matrimonial\\njudgment and during the minority of any child whose custody or\\nvisitation is the subject of a provision of a final judgment or any\\norder. An order of protection may be entered notwithstanding that the\\ncourt for any reason whatsoever, other than lack of jurisdiction,\\nrefuses to grant the relief requested in the action or proceeding.\\n  4. No order of protection may direct any party to observe conditions\\nof behavior unless: (i) the party requesting the order of protection has\\nserved and filed an action, proceeding, counterclaim or written motion\\nand, (ii) the court has made a finding on the record that such party is\\nentitled to issuance of the order of protection which may result from a\\njudicial finding of fact, judicial acceptance of an admission by the\\nparty against whom the order was issued or judicial finding that the\\nparty against whom the order is issued has given knowing, intelligent\\nand voluntary consent to its issuance. The provisions of this\\nsubdivision shall not preclude the court from issuing a temporary order\\nof protection upon the court's own motion or where a motion for such\\nrelief is made to the court, for good cause shown.\\n  5. Except with respect to enforcement pursuant to a criminal\\nprosecution under article two hundred fifteen of the penal law, the\\nsupreme court may provide in an order made pursuant to this section that\\nthe order may be enforced or modified only in the supreme court. If the\\nsupreme court so provides, the family court may not entertain an\\napplication to enforce or modify such an order of the supreme court.\\n  6. In any such matrimonial action however, the court may not sua\\nsponte consolidate actions or make, vacate or modify orders of\\nprotection issued in family court involving the same parties except upon\\nmotion and with notice to the non-moving party. Such non-moving party\\nshall be given an opportunity to be heard.\\n  7. A valid order of protection or temporary order of protection issued\\nby a court of competent jurisdiction in another state, territorial or\\ntribal jurisdiction shall be accorded full faith and credit and enforced\\nas if it were issued by a court within the state for as long as the\\norder remains in effect in the issuing jurisdiction in accordance with\\nsections two thousand two hundred sixty-five and two thousand two\\nhundred sixty-six of title eighteen of the United States Code.\\n  (a) An order issued by a court of competent jurisdiction in another\\nstate, territorial or tribal jurisdiction shall be deemed valid if:\\n  (i) the issuing court had personal jurisdiction over the parties and\\nover the subject matter under the law of the issuing jurisdiction;\\n  (ii) the person against whom the order was issued had reasonable\\nnotice and an opportunity to be heard prior to issuance of the order;\\nprovided, however, that if the order was a temporary order of protection\\nissued in the absence of such person, that notice had been given and\\nthat an opportunity to be heard had been provided within a reasonable\\nperiod of time after the issuance of the order; and\\n  (iii) in the case of orders of protection or temporary orders of\\nprotection issued against both a petitioner and respondent, the order or\\nportion thereof sought to be enforced was supported by: (A) a pleading\\nrequesting such order, including, but not limited to, a petition,\\ncross-petition or counterclaim; and (B) a judicial finding that the\\nrequesting party is entitled to the issuance of the order, which may\\nresult from a judicial finding of fact, judicial acceptance of an\\nadmission by the party against whom the order was issued or judicial\\nfinding that the party against whom the order was issued had given\\nknowing, intelligent and voluntary consent to its issuance.\\n  (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of article fifty-four of the civil\\npractice law and rules, an order of protection or temporary order of\\nprotection issued by a court of competent jurisdiction in another state,\\nterritorial or tribal jurisdiction, accompanied by a sworn affidavit\\nthat upon information and belief such order is in effect as written and\\nhas not been vacated or modified, may be filed without fee with the\\nclerk of the court, who shall transmit information regarding such order\\nto the statewide registry of orders of protection and warrants\\nestablished pursuant to section two hundred twenty-one-a of the\\nexecutive law; provided, however, that such filing and registry entry\\nshall not be required for enforcement of the order.\\n  8. Any party moving for a temporary order of protection pursuant to\\nthis subdivision during hours when the court is open shall be entitled\\nto file such motion or pleading containing such prayer for emergency\\nrelief on the same day that such person first appears at such court, and\\na hearing on the motion or portion of the pleading requesting such\\nemergency relief shall be held on the same day or the next day that the\\ncourt is in session following the filing of such motion or pleading.\\n  9. Upon issuance of an order of protection or temporary order of\\nprotection or upon a violation of such order, the court shall make a\\ndetermination regarding the suspension and revocation of a license to\\ncarry, possess, repair or dispose of a firearm or firearms,\\nineligibility for such a license and the surrender of firearms in\\naccordance with sections eight hundred forty-two-a and eight hundred\\nforty-six-a of the family court act, as applicable. Upon issuance of an\\norder of protection pursuant to this section or upon a finding of a\\nviolation thereof, the court also may direct payment of restitution in\\nan amount not to exceed ten thousand dollars in accordance with\\nsubdivision (e) of section eight hundred forty-one of such act;\\nprovided, however, that in no case shall an order of restitution be\\nissued where the court determines that the party against whom the order\\nwould be issued has already compensated the injured party or where such\\ncompensation is incorporated in a final judgment or settlement of the\\naction.\\n  9-a. The protected party in whose favor the order of protection or\\ntemporary order of protection is issued may not be held to violate an\\norder issued in his or her favor nor may such protected party be\\narrested for violating such order.\\n  10. All orders of protection and temporary orders of protection issued\\npursuant to this section along with any associated papers that may be\\nserved simultaneously shall be served in accordance with subdivision\\nthree-a of section two hundred forty of this article.\\n",
