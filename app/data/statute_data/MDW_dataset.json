Such penthouse walls shall be set back from the outer face of\\nthe front parapet wall at least five feet, from the outer face of the\\nyard parapet wall at least ten feet, and from the inner face of every\\nother parapet wall at least three feet; except that the setback so\\nrequired from any parapet wall facing any court or yard or recess\\ntherefrom but not facing any street may be reduced one-third for each\\nten per centum by which the area of such court or yard exceeds the\\nrequired minimum area thereof at the highest level of such parapet wall,\\nand the setback so required from any parapet wall facing any street may\\nbe reduced one foot for each foot that such parapet wall is set back\\nfrom the building line established by law at the highest level of such\\nparapet wall, provided that in the opinion of the department safe and\\nsufficient passage is provided to and from every part of the main roof.\\nAny penthouse wall which may be flush with the inner face of any parapet\\nwall may be flush with the outer face thereof.\\n  d. If a rear multiple dwelling is erected after April eighteenth,\\nnineteen hundred twenty-nine, on the same lot as a front multiple\\ndwelling, and the depth of the yard of the front multiple dwelling is\\nmore than sixty feet and the lowest point of such yard is below the curb\\nlevel and below the floor of a cellar of the front multiple dwelling or\\nof the lowest story thereof if there is no cellar, the height of the\\nrear multiple dwelling shall be measured from such lowest point instead\\nof from the curb level.\\n  36. A \"story\" is a space between the level of one finished floor and\\nthe level of the next higher finished floor, or, if the top story, of\\nthe space between the level of the highest finished floor and the top of\\nthe highest roof beams, or, if the first story, of the space between the\\nlevel of the finished floor and the finished ceiling immediately above.\\nFor the purpose of measuring height by stories in multiple dwellings\\nerected after April eighteenth, nineteen hundred twenty-nine, one\\nadditional story shall be added for each twelve feet or fraction thereof\\nthat the first story exceeds fifteen feet in height, and for each twelve\\nfeet or fraction thereof that any story above the first story exceeds\\ntwelve feet in height.\\n  37. A \"cellar\" in a dwelling is an enclosed space having more than\\none-half of its height below the curb level; except that where every\\npart of the building is set back more than twenty-five feet from a\\nstreet line, the height shall be measured from the adjoining grade\\nelevations calculated from final grade elevations taken at intervals of\\nten feet around the exterior walls of the building. A cellar shall not\\nbe counted as a story.\\n  38. A \"basement\" is a story partly below the curb level but having at\\nleast one-half of its height above the curb level; except that where\\nevery part of the building is set back more than twenty-five feet from a\\nstreet line, the height shall be measured from the adjoining grade\\nelevations calculated from final grade elevations taken at intervals of\\nten feet around the exterior walls of the building. A basement shall be\\ncounted as a story in determining height, except as provided in\\nparagraph e of subdivision six of section one hundred two.\\n  39. A \"section\" of a multiple dwelling is a part thereof, other than\\nan apartment or suite of rooms, separated as a unit from the rest of\\nsuch dwelling by fireproof construction.\\n  40.

It\\nshall be unlawful to occupy any class A or class B multiple dwelling,\\nincluding a hotel, unless it conforms to the provisions of the specific\\nsections enumerated in section twenty-five to the extent required\\ntherein, including the applicable provisions of this section and all\\nother applicable provisions of this chapter except that the provisions\\nof this section shall not apply to:\\n  a. Converted dwellings;\\n  b. Tenements;\\n  c. Lodging houses;\\n  d. Class A multiple dwellings erected under plans filed with the\\ndepartment after April eighteenth, nineteen hundred twenty-nine.\\n  2. Any such multiple dwelling, altered or erected after April fifth,\\nnineteen hundred forty-four, and which is required to conform to the\\nprovisions of articles one, two, three, four, five, eight, nine and\\neleven, shall not be required to conform to the provisions of\\nsubdivisions three, six, nine and ten of this section.\\n  3. The walls and ceiling of every entrance hall, stair hall or other\\npublic hall, every hall or passage not within an apartment or suite of\\nrooms, every dumb-waiter, elevator, and, except as provided in paragraph\\nd of subdivision six, every other shaft, including stairs, connecting\\nmore than two successive stories, shall be sealed off from every other\\nportion of the dwelling with fire-retarding materials approved by the\\ndepartment, or, in lieu thereof, except in the case of elevator shafts,\\nshall be equipped with one or more automatic sprinkler heads. Nothing\\ncontained herein shall be deemed to exempt from enclosure an interior\\nrequired means of egress. The provisions of this subdivision and similar\\nrequirements of section sixty-one shall not apply to a store or space\\nused for business on any story where there are no sleeping rooms, when\\nsuch store or space is protected with sprinkler heads.\\n  4. There shall be one or more completely enclosed compartments for the\\nstorage of mattresses, furniture, paints, floor wax, linens, brooms,\\nmops and other such inflammable or combustible paraphernalia incidental\\nto the occupancy and maintenance of the dwelling, and such paraphernalia\\nshall be stored in no other portion of such dwelling. Such compartments\\nshall be completely protected by one or more automatic sprinkler heads.\\nEvery door from any such compartment shall be self-closing. Closets\\nwhich do not exceed one hundred square feet in floor area may be used\\nfor the temporary storage of such paraphernalia, except mattresses,\\nfurniture, paints and insecticides containing inflammable materials and\\nare excluded from the requirements of this subdivision.\\n  5. All kitchens and pantries serving restaurants in such non-fireproof\\ndwellings shall be equipped with one or more automatic sprinkler heads.\\n  6. Except in fireproof class A multiple dwellings erected under plans\\nfiled after January first, nineteen hundred twenty-five, and which were\\ncompleted before December thirty-one, nineteen hundred thirty-three, and\\nexcept as otherwise provided in paragraph c of this subdivision, in\\nevery such dwelling three or more stories in height there shall be from\\neach story at least two independent means of unobstructed egress located\\nremote from each other and accessible to each room, apartment or suite.\\n  a. The first means of egress shall be an enclosed stair extending\\ndirectly to a street, or to a yard, court or passageway affording\\ncontinuous, safe and unobstructed access to a street, or by an enclosed\\nstair leading to the entrance story, which story shall have direct\\naccess to a street. That area of the dwelling immediately above the\\nstreet level and commonly known as the main floor, where the occupants\\nare registered and the usual business of the dwelling is conducted,\\nshall be considered a part of the entrance story; and a required stair\\nterminating at such main floor or its mezzanine shall be deemed to\\nterminate at the entrance story. An elevator or an unenclosed escalator\\nshall never be accepted as a required means of egress.\\n  b. The second means of egress shall be by an additional enclosed stair\\nconforming to the provisions of paragraph a of this subdivision, a\\nfire-stair, a fire-tower or an outside fire-escape. In a non-fireproof\\ndwelling when it is necessary to pass through a stair enclosure which\\nmay or may not be a required means of egress to reach a required means\\nof egress, such stair enclosure and that part of the public hall or\\ncorridor leading thereto from a room, apartment or suite, shall be\\nprotected by one or more sprinkler heads; in a fireproof dwelling only\\nthat part of the hall or corridor leading to such stair enclosure need\\nbe so protected.\\n  c. Where it is impractical in such existing dwellings to provide a\\nsecond means of egress, the department may order additional alteration\\nto the first means of egress and to shafts, stairs and other vertical\\nopenings as the department may deem necessary to safeguard the occupants\\nof the dwelling, may require the public halls providing access to the\\nfirst means of egress to be equipped on each story with one or more\\nautomatic sprinkler heads, and, in non-fireproof dwellings, may also\\nrequire automatic sprinkler heads in the stair which serves as the only\\nmeans of egress.\\n  d. Nothing in this section shall be deemed to require the enclosure of\\na stair which is ornamental provided such stair does not connect more\\nthan two stories.\\n  e. A stair, fire-stair, fire-tower or fire-escape which is\\nsupplementary to the egress requirements of paragraphs a, b and c of\\nthis subdivision need not lead to the entrance story or to a street, or\\nto a yard or a court which leads to a street, provided the means of\\negress therefrom is approved by the department.\\n  7. a. All doors opening from shafts, stair halls or stairs and the\\ndoor assemblies shall be fire-resistive with the doors self-closing and\\nwithout transoms or any other opening.\\n  b. All other doors opening upon entrance halls or other public halls\\nor corridors in every part of the dwelling shall be self-closing. In\\nnon-fireproof dwellings any existing openings in such doors, except in\\ndoors to public toilet rooms or bathrooms, shall be closed and sealed in\\nsuch manner as to provide a fire-resistive rating equal to the\\nfire-resistive rating of the remainder of the door. Except as provided\\nin this paragraph, any existing transoms over such doors in such\\nnon-fireproof dwellings shall be firmly secured in a closed position, or\\nremoved and the openings closed, in a manner satisfactory to the\\ndepartment. If such doors or transoms are glazed with plain glass, such\\nglass shall be removed and replaced with wire glass one-quarter of an\\ninch in thickness or replaced with material approved by the department.\\nIn non-fireproof dwellings existing transoms or ventilating louvres in\\npublic halls or corridors, and any openings in partitions separating\\nsleeping rooms from public halls or corridors to provide ventilation,\\nneed not be replaced, closed or sealed provided such public halls or\\ncorridors are protected by automatic sprinkler heads. When existing\\nventilating louvres are located in the lower half of any such door they\\nmay be retained and new ventilating louvres may be installed in the\\nlower half of any new or existing doors provided the openable area of\\nevery such louvre does not exceed one hundred forty-four square inches\\nand the bottom of the opening is one foot or more above the finished\\nfloor of the public hall or corridor upon which such door opens and, in\\nsuch case, no sprinkler system shall be required.\\n  c. Every existing interior glazed sash, window or opening, other than\\na door, in any partition forming required enclosures around stairs or\\nshafts shall be removed and the openings closed up and fire-retarded.\\nWhere an existing sash provides borrowed light to a public hall or\\ncorridor from a living room and there is no glass panel in the door\\nproviding access to such room, such sash shall be made stationary in a\\nclosed position and be glazed with wire glass one-quarter inch in\\nthickness, or be entirely removed and the opening closed up with\\nincombustible material.\\n  d. All openings which provide direct access to a fire-escape from a\\npublic hall or corridor shall be equipped with fireproof doors and\\nassemblies with the door self-closing or fireproof windows glazed with\\nclear wire glass. Doors providing access to fire-escapes from public\\nhalls or corridors may be glazed with clear wire glass.\\n  e. It shall be unlawful to attach to or maintain on or about any door\\nrequired to be self-closing any device which prevents the self-closing\\nof such door.\\n  8. a. (i) Every means of egress shall be indicated by a sign reading\\n\"EXIT\" in red letters at least eight inches high on a white background,\\nor vice versa, illuminated at all times during the day and night by a\\nred light of at least twenty-five watts or equivalent illumination. Such\\nlight shall be maintained in a keyless socket. On all stories where\\ndoors, openings or passageways giving access to any means of egress are\\nnot visible from all portions of such stories, lighted or reflective\\ndirectional signs shall be maintained in conspicuous locations,\\nindicating in red on a white background, or vice versa, the direction of\\ntravel to the nearest means of egress. In addition to being posted in\\nconspicuous locations, such signs located near the floor, giving\\ndirection to the nearest means of egress, shall also be maintained. At\\nleast one sign shall be visible from the doorway of each room or suite\\nof rooms. Existing signs and illumination may be accepted if, in the\\nopinion of the department, such existing signs and illumination serve\\nthe intent and purpose of this subdivision. Supplementary stairs,\\nfire-stairs, fire-towers or fire-escapes which do not lead to the\\nentrance story or to a street or to a yard or court, leading to a\\nstreet, shall be clearly marked \"NOT AN EXIT\" in black letters at least\\nfour inches high on a yellow background and at the termination of each\\nsuch stair, fire-stair, fire-tower or fire-escape, there shall be a\\ndirectional sign indicating the nearest means of egress leading to a\\nstreet. All signs shall be constructed, located and illuminated in a\\nmanner satisfactory to the department.\\n  b. On each floor of every hotel or motel having two or more stories\\nwhere the rooms or suites of rooms are connected by an interior hallway,\\nthere shall be posted by each stairway, elevator or other means of\\negress a printed scale floor plan of the particular story, which shall\\nshow all means of egress, clearly labeling those to be used in case of\\nfire. Such signs shall be posted in other conspicuous areas throughout\\nthe building. Said floor plan shall be no smaller than eight inches by\\nten inches and shall be posted in such a manner that it cannot be\\nreadily removed.\\n  9. The ceiling of the story immediately below the entrance story shall\\nbe fire-retarded or be equipped with one or more sprinkler heads. Any\\nboiler or furnace room within the dwelling used in connection with\\nsupplying heat or hot water shall be enclosed with fire-retarded\\npartitions and every door opening therefrom and its assembly shall be\\nfireproof with the door self-closing. The ceiling of such room shall\\nalso be fire-retarded or be equipped with one or more sprinkler heads.\\n  10. a. There shall be provided in the roof directly over each stair,\\nfire-stair, fire-tower, dumb-waiter, elevator or similar shaft which\\nextends to or within one story of a roof, a ventilating metal skylight\\nhaving horizontal dimensions equal at least to seventy-five per centum\\nof the cross-sectional area of such shaft. Such skylight need not,\\nhowever, exceed twenty square feet in area. Where an existing skylight\\nis smaller than the dimensions or area prescribed in this paragraph, no\\nstructural change shall be required, but a ventilating metal skylight\\nfitting the existing opening in the roof shall be sufficient. Every\\nskylight shall be glazed with plain glass in the roof of such skylight\\nand shall be equipped with metal screens over and under the skylight. In\\nlieu of a skylight a window of the same area at the top story shall be\\naccepted.\\n  b. Whenever there is a flooring of solid construction at the top of\\nany enclosed stair, fire-stair, fire-tower, elevator or similar shaft,\\nopenings shall be left near the top of such shaft for ventilation. Such\\nopenings shall provide at least two hundred eighty-eight square inches\\nof unobstructed ventilation and shall communicate directly with the\\nouter air, or be otherwise ventilated in accordance with the provisions\\nof the local building code.\\n  c. It shall be unlawful to discharge into any such shaft any\\ninflammable or volatile gases, liquids or other thing or matter which\\nwould endanger life.\\n  11. a. There shall be a fire-retarded bulkhead in the roof over, or\\nconnecting directly by means of a public hall with the highest portion\\nof, every stair extending to the highest story below the main roof.\\nStairs leading to such bulkheads shall be fire-retarded as required for\\nother public stairs and shall have at the top fireproof doors and\\nassemblies with the doors self-closing. All stairs to required bulkheads\\nshall be provided with a guide or handrail. A scuttle so constructed as\\nto be readily opened may be substituted for a bulkhead in such dwellings\\ntwo stories or less in height. Such scuttle shall be at least twenty-one\\ninches in width and twenty-eight inches in length, covered on the\\noutside with metal and provided with a stationary iron or steel ladder\\nleading thereto.\\n  b. When a dwelling has a pitched or sloping roof with a pitch or slope\\nof more than fifteen degrees, no bulkhead or scuttle, or stair or ladder\\nleading thereto shall be required.\\n  c. A bulkhead door or scuttle shall never be self-locking and shall be\\nfastened on the inside with movable rustproof bolts, hooks, or a lock\\nwhich does not require a key to open from the inside of the dwelling.\\n  d. Bulkheads and stairs leading thereto existing on April fifth,\\nnineteen hundred forty-four, shall be permitted provided the stairs have\\nsuch angle of ascent and treads of such dimensions as may be approved by\\nthe department.\\n  12. In every such dwelling containing thirty or more rooms used for\\nliving or sleeping purposes by transient occupants there shall be a\\nclosed-circuit interior fire alarm system. Such alarm system shall be so\\ninstalled and maintained that it can be operated manually from any story\\nto sound an alarm or alarms capable of being heard clearly in all parts\\nof the dwelling. Such alarm system shall be installed, arranged and\\nmaintained in a manner satisfactory to the fire department.\\n  13. When the local building code requires a standpipe system such\\nsystem shall comply with all of the applicable requirements of such\\ncode.\\n  14. In every such fireproof dwelling containing fifty or more rooms\\nused for living or sleeping purposes by transient occupants and in every\\nsuch non-fireproof dwelling containing thirty or more such rooms, the\\nowner shall employ one or more watchmen or clerks whose duty it shall be\\nto visit every portion of the dwelling at frequent regular intervals for\\nthe purpose of detecting fire or other sources of danger and giving\\nimmediate and timely warning thereof to all the occupants. There shall\\nbe provided a watchman's clock system or other device to record the\\nmovements of such watchman. Such system shall be installed, supervised\\nand maintained in a manner satisfactory to the fire department. However,\\nthe provisions of this subdivision shall not apply where, throughout the\\ndwelling, a closed-circuit, automatic, thermostatic fire-detecting\\nsystem is installed which actuates a fire alarm, or where, throughout\\nthe dwelling, an approved-type automatic sprinkler system is installed\\nwhich actuates a fire alarm by the flow of water through such system.\\n  15. a. Nothing in this section shall be construed as permitting\\npartitions or materials which are not fireproof in any fireproof\\ndwelling; nor shall anything in this section be deemed to abrogate any\\npowers or duties vested by law in the fire commissioner or fire\\ndepartment, except that an existing sprinkler installation, fire alarm\\nor standpipe system which has been approved or accepted by the\\ndepartment having jurisdiction and installed before July first, nineteen\\nhundred forty-eight, shall, after inspection by the said department, be\\ndeemed to be in compliance with the requirements of this section or may\\nbe altered or adapted to meet such requirements instead of a completely\\nnew installation or system.\\n  b. All automatic sprinkler heads required by this section shall be\\nconstructed to fuse at a temperature not higher than one hundred\\nsixty-five degrees Fahrenheit, spaced so as to protect the area which is\\nrequired to be sprinklered, and installed, arranged and maintained in\\nconformity with regulations adopted by the department.\\n  c. For the purposes of subdivisions twelve and fourteen of this\\nsection, the term \"transient occupancy\" shall mean the occupancy of a\\nroom for living purposes by the same person or persons for a period of\\nninety days or less.\\n  16. a. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary,\\nwithin a dwelling to which this section is applicable the use of\\ndwelling units as a hotel for other than permanent residence purposes,\\nas defined in paragraph a of subdivision eight of section four of this\\nchapter, that would otherwise be prohibited shall be permitted to\\ncontinue for a period of two years after the effective date of this\\nsubdivision provided that:\\n  (1) such dwelling units were used for other than permanent residence\\npurposes on January first, two thousand nine and on the effective date\\nof this subdivision and fifty-one percent or more of the total number of\\ndwelling units in such dwelling were used for other than permanent\\nresidence purposes on such dates;\\n  (2) such dwelling was occupied as a hotel for other than permanent\\nresidence purposes on December fifteenth, nineteen hundred sixty-one;\\n  (3) such dwelling is of fireproof construction and was of fireproof\\nconstruction on January first, two thousand nine;\\n  (4) such dwelling units used for other than permanent residence\\npurposes have at least two lawful means of egress, including exit\\nstairs, fire towers or exterior stairs but excluding fire escapes and\\nhad such lawful means of egress on January first, two thousand nine;\\n  (5) such dwelling has operational exit signs and a fire alarm system\\ncomplying with the provisions for existing transient occupancies in\\naccordance with local law and had such exit signs and fire alarm system\\non January first, two thousand nine; and\\n  (6) such dwelling units used for other than permanent residence\\npurposes are registered with the department within one hundred eighty\\ndays after the effective date of this subdivision in a form and manner\\nto be provided by such department, including a requirement that the\\napplicant submit certification of compliance with subparagraphs three,\\nfour and five of this paragraph, signed and sealed by a registered\\narchitect or licensed professional engineer in good standing under the\\neducation law.

It is hereby declared and found that in\\ncities with a population in excess of one million, large numbers of\\nloft, manufacturing, commercial, institutional, public and community\\nfacility buildings have lost, and continue to lose, their tenants to\\nmore modern premises; and that the untenanted portions of such buildings\\nconstitute a potential housing stock within such cities which is\\ncapable, when appropriately altered, of accommodating general\\nresidential use, thereby contributing to an alleviation of the housing\\nshortage most severely affecting moderate and middle income families,\\nand of accommodating joint living-work quarters for artists by making\\nreadily available space which is physically and economically suitable\\nfor use by persons regularly engaged in the arts.\\n  There is a public purpose to be served by making accommodations\\nreadily available for joint living-work quarters for artists for the\\nfollowing reasons:  persons regularly engaged in the arts require larger\\namounts of space for the pursuit of their artistic endeavors and for the\\nstorage of the materials therefor and of the products thereof than are\\nregularly to be found in dwellings subject to this article; that the\\nfinancial remunerations to be obtained from pursuit of a career in the\\narts are generally small; that as a result of such limited financial\\nremuneration persons regularly engaged in the arts generally find it\\nfinancially impossible to maintain quarters for the pursuit of their\\nartistic endeavors separate and apart from their places of residence;\\nthat the cultural life of cities of more than one million persons within\\nthis state and of the state as a whole is enhanced by the residence in\\nsuch cities of large numbers of persons regularly engaged in the arts;\\nthat the high cost of land within such cities makes it particularly\\ndifficult for persons regularly engaged in the arts to obtain the use of\\nthe amounts of space required for their work as aforesaid; and that the\\nresidential use of the space is secondary or accessory to the primary\\nuse as a place of work.\\n  It is further declared that the legislation governing the alteration\\nof such buildings to accommodate general residential use must of\\nnecessity be more restrictive than statutes heretofore in effect, which\\naffected only joint living-work quarters for artists.\\n  It is the intention of this legislation to promulgate statewide\\nminimum standards for all alterations of non-residential buildings to\\nresidential use, but the legislature is cognizant that the use of such\\nbuildings for residential purposes must be consistent with local zoning\\nordinances. The legislature further recognizes that it is the role of\\nlocalities to adopt regulations which will define in further detail the\\nmanner in which alterations should be carried out where building types\\nand conditions are peculiar to their local environment.\\n",

The legislature hereby finds and declares\\nthat a serious public emergency exists in the housing of a considerable\\nnumber of persons in cities having a population of over one million,\\nwhich emergency has been created by the increasing number of conversions\\nof commercial and manufacturing loft buildings to residential use\\nwithout compliance with applicable building codes and laws and without\\ncompliance with local laws regarding minimum housing maintenance\\nstandards; that many such buildings do not conform to minimum standards\\nfor health, safety and fire protection; that housing maintenance\\nservices essential to maintain health, safety and fire protection are\\nnot being provided in many such buildings; that as a consequence of the\\nacute shortage of housing as found and declared in the emergency tenant\\nprotection act of nineteen seventy-four the tenants in such buildings\\nwould suffer great hardship if forced to relocate; that as a result of\\nthe uncertain status of the tenancy in question the courts have been\\nincreasingly burdened with disputes between landlords and tenants\\nregarding their respective rights and obligations under the existing\\ncircumstances; that some courts have declared such buildings \"de facto\"\\nmultiple dwellings; that illegal and unregulated residential conversions\\nundermine the integrity of the local zoning resolution and threaten loss\\nof jobs and industry; that the intervention of the state and local\\ngovernments is necessary to effectuate legalization, consistent with the\\nlocal zoning resolution, of the present illegal living arrangements in\\nsuch \"de facto\" multiple dwellings, and to establish a system whereby\\nresidential rentals can be reasonably adjusted so that residential\\ntenants can assist in paying the cost of such legalization without being\\nforced to relocate; that in order to prevent uncertainty, hardship, and\\ndislocation, the provisions of this article are necessary and designed\\nto protect the public health, safety and general welfare.\\n",

The determination as to which violations are \"rent impairing\" shall\\nbe made in the following manner. Within six months after the enactment\\nof this section, the department shall promulgate a list of conditions\\nconstituting violations of the provisions of this chapter and of any\\nregulations promulgated pursuant to the provisions of subdivision four\\nof section three of this chapter. Such list shall contain a brief\\ndescription of the condition constituting the violation, the section of\\nthis chapter or regulation violated, and the order number assigned\\nthereto.

Within a reasonable time after the\\nhearing, the department shall make and publish a list of those\\nviolations which are classified as rent impairing.

The expenses and disbursements incurred by the department in\\ncarrying out such orders shall be met from any appropriation for such\\npurpose or, to the extent that no such appropriation has been made or\\nthat any such appropriation is insufficient, from the proceeds of the\\nsale of obligations pursuant to the local finance law.\\n  3. Whenever the department has incurred any expense for which payment\\nis due under the provisions of this section, the department may\\ninstitute and maintain a suit against the owner of the dwelling in\\nrespect to which such expense shall have been incurred and may recover\\nthe amount of such expense as in this section provided. In any case\\nwhere expenditures made or obligations incurred by a receiver appointed\\npursuant to subdivision five of this section in remedying a nuisance are\\nnot paid or reimbursed from the rents and income of the dwelling or\\nwhere the receivership expenses, fees and commissions are not paid or\\nreimbursed from the rents and income of the dwelling, the receiver may\\ninstitute and maintain a suit against the owner of the dwelling to\\nrecover such deficiency.\\n  4. a. The department or a receiver appointed pursuant to subdivision\\nfive of this section shall have a lien, for the expenses necessarily\\nincurred in the execution of an order, upon the premises upon or in\\nrespect of which the work required by said order has been done or\\nexpenses incurred, which lien shall have priority over all other\\nmortgages,liens and encumbrances of record, except taxes and assessments\\nlevied pursuant to law. In the event that a receiver having a lien, in\\nfavor of the department of real estate, is discharged and such lien is\\nin effect at the time of such discharge, such lien shall continue to\\nvest in the department of real estate.\\n  b. No such lien shall be valid for any purpose until the department or\\nreceiver, as the case may be, shall file where notices of mechanics'\\nliens are required to be filed, a notice containing the same particulars\\nas required to be stated with reference to mechanics' liens, with the\\nfurther statement that the expense has been incurred in pursuance of the\\norder of the department, and giving the date of the order, or in\\nperformance by the receiver of the work required to remedy a condition\\npursuant to an order of the court establishing the receivership and\\ngiving the date of the order, or that a deficiency has accrued with\\nrespect to the receivership established pursuant to an order of the\\ncourt and giving the date of the order, as the case may be. Such notice\\nshall be filed at any time during the progress of the work required by\\nsuch order or undertaken by the receiver, or within four months after\\nthe completion of the contract, or the final performance of the work or\\nthe final furnishing of the materials, dating from the last item of work\\nperformed or materials furnished or, in the case of a deficiency, at any\\ntime before the discharge of the receiver.\\n  c. The officer with whom such notice is filed shall make the same\\nentry on the book or index in which mechanics' liens are entered as he\\nis required to enter in cases of mechanics' liens, together with a\\nreference to such order by date; and thereafter such lien shall, except\\nas herein otherwise provided, have the same effect in all respects as to\\nall persons as a mechanics' lien; and all proceedings with reference to\\nsuch lien, its enforcement and discharge, shall be carried on in the\\nsame manner as similar proceedings with reference to other mechanics'\\nliens.\\n  d. Unless, within six months after actual notice of such filing,\\nproceedings are taken by the party against whom or whose premises a lien\\nis claimed, to discharge such lien, the filing shall, as to all persons\\nhaving such actual notice, become conclusive evidence that the amount\\nclaimed in the notice of lien, with interest, is due, and is a just lien\\nupon the premises.\\n  e. Such lien shall continue to be a lien for a period of one year from\\nthe time of its filing unless proceedings are in the meantime taken to\\nenforce or discharge it, which may be done at any time during its\\ncontinuance. In case proceedings are so taken, the lien shall remain in\\neffect until the final termination of such proceedings; and if such\\nproceedings shall result in a judgment for the amount claimed or any\\nportion thereof, such judgment shall, to such extent, be a lien in the\\nsame manner and from the same time as the original lien.\\n  5. a. If the department shall desire that a receiver be appointed as\\nherein after provided to remove or remedy a nuisance described in\\nparagraph e of subdivision one of this section and that such receiver\\nshall obtain a lien for costs incurred in connection therewith in favor\\nof the department of real estate, which shall have the priority with\\nrespect to existing mortgages or liens provided in paragraph e of this\\nsubdivision, it shall within five days after the service of the order\\nupon the owner serve a copy of such order upon every mortgagee and\\nlienor of record personally or by registered mail, return receipt\\nrequested, at the address set forth in the recorded mortgage or lien.\\nAppended to the copy of such order shall be a notice addressed to such\\nmortgagee and lienor stating that in the event the nuisance is not\\nremoved or remedied in the manner and within the time specified in the\\norder, the department may apply to the supreme court, or to the housing\\npart of the New York city civil court, if the premises are located in\\nthe city of New York, or, to the district court, if the premises are\\nlocated in whole or in part within a district of the court, or, to the\\ncity court of a city outside the city of New York, if the premises are\\nlocated in whole or in part within such city, for an order to show cause\\nwhy a receiver of the rents, issues and profits of the property shall\\nnot be appointed with rights therein superior to those of such owner,\\nmortgagee or lienor.\\n  b. The department shall file a copy of such notice and order in the\\noffice of the county clerk in which mechanics liens affecting the\\nproperty would be filed.\\n  c. 1. The department may thereafter apply to the supreme court in the\\ncounty where the property is situated, or to the housing part of the\\ncivil court of the city of New York, if the property is situated in the\\ncity of New York, by verified petition for an order directing the owner\\nand any mortgagees or lienors of record to show cause why the\\ncommissioner or chief executive of the bureau or department of real\\nestate of the municipality should not be appointed receiver of the\\nrents, issues and profits of the property and why said receiver should\\nnot remove or remedy such condition and obtain a lien in favor of the\\ndepartment of real estate against the property having the priority\\nprovided in paragraph e of this subdivision to secure repayment of the\\ncosts incurred by the receiver in removing or remedying such condition.\\nSuch application shall contain (a) proof by affidavit that an order of\\nthe department has been issued and served on the owner, mortgagees and\\nlienors in accordance with and within the periods specified in paragraph\\ne of subdivision one of this section and paragraph a of this subdivision\\nand filed in accordance with the provisions of paragraph b of this\\nsubdivision; (b) a statement that a nuisance which constitutes a serious\\nfire hazard or is a serious threat to life, health, or safety continued\\nto exist in said property after the time fixed for the removal thereof\\nin the department order and a description of the property and conditions\\nconstituting such nuisance; (c) a brief description of the nature of the\\nwork required to remove or remedy the condition and an estimate as to\\nthe cost thereof. Such order to show cause shall be returnable not less\\nthan five days after service is completed and shall provide for personal\\nservice of a copy thereof and the papers on which it is based on the\\nowners and mortgagees of record and lienors. If any such owner,\\nmortgagee or lienor cannot with due diligence be served personally\\nwithin the city where the property is located and within the time fixed\\nin such order, then service may be made on such persons by posting a\\ncopy thereof in a conspicuous place on the premises where the nuisance\\nexists, and by sending a copy thereof by registered mail, return receipt\\nrequested, to the owner at the last address registered by him with the\\ndepartment, or in the absence of such registration, to the address set\\nforth in the last recorded deed with respect to said premises, or, in\\nthe case of a mortgagee or lienor, to the address set forth in the\\nrecorded mortgage or lien and by publication in a newspaper of general\\ncirculation in the county where such premises are located, which\\nnewspaper, if there is an official law paper for such county, shall be\\nsuch official law paper. Service shall be deemed complete on filing\\nproof of service thereof in the office of the clerk of the court in\\nwhich such application is made.\\n  2. If the condition constituting the nuisance is such that unless\\nimmediately cured irreparable damage may be caused to the building or it\\nconstitutes an imminent danger to its occupants, or the occupants of\\nadjoining properties then the order to show cause may be returnable in\\nthe discretion of the court in less than five days, and in such case,\\nservice may be made on the owner, mortgagee and lienor by posting a copy\\nthereof in a conspicuous place on the premises where the nuisance exists\\nand by mailing a copy in the case of the owner to the address filed with\\nthe department and in the case of the mortgagee and lienor to the\\naddress recorded. If a receiver be appointed as hereinafter provided,\\nand service shall not have been made in accordance with subparagraph\\none, then his appointment shall be temporary only and expire not more\\nthan thirty days thereafter unless, prior to the expiration of such\\nthirty days, the department shall serve notice on the owner, mortgagees\\nand lienors in the manner provided for in subparagraph one hereof of\\nintention to apply to the court at a date fixed in such notice and not\\nless than five days after the service of such notice, for an extension\\nof said receivership. In such event the period of the appointment of the\\ntemporary receiver shall be deemed to be extended for a further period\\nof fifteen days. In addition to the requirements set forth in\\nsubparagraph one, such notice shall also contain a statement of any\\nexpenditures made or obligations incurred by the receiver during the\\nperiod of his temporary appointment. On the date fixed in such notice,\\nthe court shall determine whether or not to extend the period of\\nreceivership and such determination shall be made as if the application\\nwere an original one for the appointment of a receiver, pursuant to\\nsubparagraph one.\\n  3. On the return of said order to show cause, determination shall have\\nprecedence over every other business of the court unless the court shall\\nfind that some other pending proceeding, having a similar statutory\\nprecedence, shall have priority. If the court shall find that the facts\\nstated in such application warrant the granting thereof, then the\\ncommissioner or chief executive of the bureau or department of real\\nestate of the municipality shall be appointed receiver of the rents,\\nissues and profits of the property. However after determination of the\\nissue if the owner or any mortgagee or lienor or other person having an\\ninterest in the property shall apply to the court to be permitted to\\nremove or remedy the conditions constituting the nuisance and shall (1)\\ndemonstrate the ability promptly to undertake the work required; and (2)\\npost security for the performance thereof within the time, and in the\\namount and manner, deemed necessary by the court, then the court may in\\nlieu of appointing such receiver issue an order permitting such person\\nto perform the work within a time fixed by the court. If at the time\\nfixed in the order the conditions constituting the nuisance have not\\nbeen satisfactorily remedied or removed, then the court shall appoint\\nsuch receiver. If after the granting of an order permitting a person to\\nperform the work but before the time fixed by the court for the\\ncompletion thereof it shall appear to the department that the person\\npermitted to do the same is not proceeding with due diligence, then the\\ndepartment may apply to the court on notice to those persons who have\\nappeared in the proceeding for a hearing to determine whether such\\nreceiver shall be appointed immediately. On the failure of any such\\nowner, mortgagee, lienor or other person having an interest in the\\nproperty to complete the work in accordance with the provisions of said\\norder, the department, or any such receiver thereafter appointed shall\\nbe reimbursed for costs incurred by him in removing or remedying the\\ncondition and other charges herein provided for out of such security.\\n  d. 1. Any receiver appointed pursuant to this subdivision shall have\\nall of the powers and duties of a receiver appointed in an action to\\nforeclose a mortgage on real property, together with such additional\\npowers and duties as herein granted and imposed. The receiver shall with\\nall reasonable speed remedy the nuisance and remove all the delinquent\\nmatters and deficiencies in the dwelling including those constituting a\\nfire hazard or a threat to life, health or safety and may, in addition\\nto ordinary repairs, maintenance and replacement, make other\\nimprovements to effect a rehabilitation of the property, in such fashion\\nas is consistent with maintaining safe and habitable conditions over the\\nremaining useful life of the dwelling. He shall have the power to let\\ncontracts therefor or incur expenses in accordance with the provisions\\nof local laws, ordinances, rules and regulations applicable to contracts\\nfor public works except that advertisement shall not be required for\\neach such contract. Notwithstanding any such laws, ordinances, rules or\\nregulations, the receiver may let contracts or incur expenses for\\nindividual items of repairs, improvements or supplies without the\\nprocurement of competitive bids where the total amount of any such\\nindividual item does not exceed twenty-five hundred dollars. The\\nreceiver shall not be required to file any bond. He shall collect the\\naccrued and accruing rents, issues and profits of the dwelling and apply\\nthe same to the cost of removing or remedying such nuisance, to the\\nmaking of such other improvements as aforestated, to the payment of\\nexpenses reasonably necessary to the proper operation and management of\\nthe property, including insurance and the fees of the managing agent,\\nand the necessary expenses of his office as receiver, the repayment of\\nall monies advanced to the receiver by the department of real estate to\\ncover the costs incurred by the receiver and interest thereon; and then,\\nif there be a surplus, to unpaid taxes, assessments, water rents, sewer\\nrents and penalties and interest thereon, and then to sums due to\\nmortgagees or lienors. If the income of the property shall be\\ninsufficient to cover the cost of remedying or removing such nuisance,\\nor to making of such other improvements as aforestated, or of the\\nexpenses reasonably necessary to the proper operation and management of\\nthe property and other necessary expenses of the receiver, the\\ndepartment of real estate shall advance to the receiver any sums\\nrequired to cover such cost and expenses and thereupon shall have a lien\\nagainst the property having the priority provided in paragraph e for any\\nsuch sums so advanced with interest thereon.\\n  2. Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to relieve the owner of\\nany civil or criminal liability incurred or any duty imposed by this\\nchapter by reason of acts or omissions of the owner prior to the\\nappointment of any receiver hereunder, nor shall anything contained\\nherein be construed to suspend during the receivership any obligation of\\nthe owner for the payment of taxes or other operating and maintenance\\nexpenses of the dwelling nor of the owner or any other person for the\\npayment of mortgages or liens.\\n  3. The receiver shall be entitled to the same fees, commissions and\\nnecessary expenses as receivers in actions to foreclose mortgages. Such\\nfees and commissions shall be paid into the fund created pursuant to\\nsubdivision nine of this section. The receiver shall be liable only in\\nhis official capacity for injury to person and property by reason of\\nconditions of the premises in a case where an owner would have been\\nliable; he shall not have any liability in his personal capacity. The\\npersonnel and facilities of the bureau or department of real estate and\\nthe corporation counsel shall be availed of by the receiver for the\\npurpose of carrying out his duties as such receiver and the cost of such\\nservices shall be deemed a necessary expense of the receiver.\\n  4. The receiver shall be discharged upon rendering a full and complete\\naccounting to the court when such condition has been removed and the\\ncost thereof and all other costs authorized by this paragraph have been\\npaid or reimbursed from the rents and income of the dwelling and the\\nsurplus money, if any, has been paid over to the owner or the mortgagee\\nor lienor as the court may direct. However, at any time, the receiver\\nmay be discharged upon filing his account as receiver without affecting\\nthe right of the department of real estate to its lien. Upon the removal\\nof such condition, the owner, the mortgagee or any lienor may apply for\\nthe discharge of the receiver upon payment to the receiver of all moneys\\nexpended by the receiver for removal of such condition and all other\\ncosts authorized by this paragraph which have not been paid or\\nreimbursed from the rents and income of the dwelling.\\n  5. Anything herein contained to the contrary notwithstanding, a\\ntemporary receiver appointed on the return of an order to show cause\\nserved only in accordance with subparagraph two of paragraph c of this\\nsubdivision shall not, without express order of the court, make any\\nrepairs or improvements to the property or incur any expenses in the\\noperation thereof during the period of his temporary appointment except\\nsuch as may be necessary to remedy or remove the immediate condition\\nwhich called for his appointment and to the ordinary operation and\\nmaintenance of the property. For such specific purpose the receiver\\nshall be entitled to let such contracts and undertake such expenses as\\nmay be necessary to accomplish the specific results without\\nadvertisements and without procuring competitive bids.\\n  e. Any lien of a receiver, in favor of the department of real estate,\\narising under this section shall have priority over all other mortgages,\\nliens and encumbrances of record except taxes and assessments levied\\npursuant to law.\\n  f. Failure to serve a copy of the order and notice required in the\\nmanner specified by paragraph e of subdivision one and paragraph a of\\nthis subdivision, or failure to serve any mortgagee or lienor with a\\ncopy of the order to show cause as required by subparagraph one of\\nparagraph c of this subdivision shall not affect the validity of the\\nproceeding or the appointment of a receiver, but the rights of the\\ndepartment of real estate or of the receiver shall not in such event be\\nsuperior in any way to the rights of any mortgagee or lienor who shall\\nnot have been served as provided herein.\\n  g. Any mortgagee or lienor who at his expense remedies or removes the\\nnuisance to the satisfaction of the court pursuant to the provisions of\\nsubparagraph three of paragraph c of this subdivision shall have and be\\nentitled to enforce a lien equivalent to the lien granted to the\\nreceiver in favor of the department of real estate hereunder. Any\\nmortgagee or lienor who, following the appointment of a receiver by the\\ncourt, shall reimburse the receiver and the department of real estate\\nfor all costs and charges as hereinabove provided shall be entitled to\\nan assignment of the lien granted to the receiver in favor of the\\ndepartment of real estate.\\n  6. When the department shall have executed any order so far as it may\\nrequire, the department shall file among its records such order and an\\naffidavit stating with fairness and accuracy in general terms the items\\nof expense and the date of execution of such order. When it shall appear\\nthat such execution, or the expenses thereof, related to several\\npremises belonging to different persons, such affidavit shall state what\\npart belongs to or arose in respect to each of the premises as the\\ndepartment may direct. The department may revise the correctness of such\\napportionment of expenses as truth and justice may require.\\n  7. a. Whenever the department shall sue for the expenses involved in\\nthe execution of any order, it may join in the same suit any claim for\\nany penalty for the violation of any provisions of this chapter. Joint\\nor several judgments may be had against one or more of the defendants in\\nthe suit, as they or any of them may be liable in respect of all or any\\nof such claims. The expenses of executing such an order, and any\\njudgment in any abatement suit provided for in this chapter, and the\\nseveral judgments that may be recovered for any such penalties and\\nexpenses, until the same are paid or discharged shall be a lien like\\nother judgments, and also a lien and charge upon rent and compensation\\ndue or then maturing from any tenant or occupant of the dwelling and\\npremises or parts thereof to which any such order or judgment relates,\\nor in respect of which any such expenses were incurred.\\n  b. The department may serve a copy of an order or a transcript of a\\njudgment and any affidavit showing the expense of execution upon any\\nperson who owes or is about to owe any rent or compensation for the\\noccupancy of any premises to which such order or judgment relates, and\\nin respect of which such expenses were incurred. The department may, at\\nany time after such service, demand in writing that such rent or\\ncompensation to the extent of such claim shall, when such rent or\\ncompensation becomes due and payable, be paid to the department and such\\nperson shall thereupon become obligated to pay the same. A receipt shall\\nbe given for each such payment stating on account of what order or\\njudgment and expenses it has been received. The amount so received shall\\nbe deposited wherever other funds of the department are kept. If a\\nspecial fund has been created and maintained, as provided in section\\nthree hundred four, such payments shall be deposited to the credit of\\nsuch fund.\\n  c. Any person refusing or omitting to make such a payment after such\\nservice and demand may be sued therefor by the department. Such person\\nshall not in such suit dispute the authority of the department to incur\\nor order such expenses or the validity or correctness of such expenses\\nor judgment in any particular, or the right of the department to have\\nthe same paid from such rent or compensation. The receipt of the\\ndepartment for any sum so paid shall, in all suits and proceedings and\\nfor every purpose, be as effectual in favor of any person holding the\\nsame as actual payment of the amount thereof to the owner or other\\nperson on persons who would, but for the provisions of this section and\\nof such demand, have been entitled to receive the sum so paid. No tenant\\nor occupant of any premises shall be dispossessed or disturbed, nor\\nshall any lease or contract or rights be forfeited or impaired, nor any\\nforfeiture or liability be incurred, by reason of any omission to pay to\\nany owner, contractor or other person any sum so paid to the department.\\n  8. The department shall retain any money so paid until twelve days\\nafter it has received evidence by satisfactory affidavit that the party\\nor parties, or his or their agent, who but for the provisions hereof\\nwould have been entitled to receive the same, has had written notice of\\nsuch payment being made, which notice shall be served in the manner\\nprovided by this chapter for the service of an order. If at the end of\\nsuch twelve days the party or parties so notified have not instituted\\nsuit to recover such money the department shall pay it to the fiscal\\nofficer of the city. If a special fund has been created and maintained\\nas provided in section three hundred four, the fiscal officer shall\\ndeposit such money to the credit of such fund.\\n  9. The expenses incurred by the receiver in removing or remedying a\\ncondition pursuant to the provisions of this section shall be met from a\\nfund to be known as the multiple dwelling section three hundred nine\\noperating fund. Such fund shall consist of such amounts as may be\\nappropriated by the board of estimate or other analogous appropriating\\nbody of the city. Such fund shall be maintained in a separate account by\\nthe department of real estate and expenditures therefrom may be made by\\nthe receiver to meet the costs of removing or remedying such conditions,\\nsubject to audit by the comptroller or chief fiscal officer of the city.\\nThe receiver shall repay the amounts so expended to such fund from the\\nproceeds of any amounts recovered pursuant to the provisions of this\\nsection. In the event that the amount in such fund is insufficient for\\nsuch purposes and if no appropriation or an insufficient appropriation\\nhas been made therefor, the expenses incurred by the receiver in\\nremoving or remedying such conditions may be met from the proceeds of\\nthe sale of bonds issued in accordance with the provisions of the local\\nfinance law.\\n  In the event that the amounts from time to time in such fund exceed\\ntwo hundred thousand dollars ($200,000), such excess may be applied to\\nthe payment of the principal and interest due upon any bonds issued\\npursuant to this subdivision, or, if no such bonds are outstanding, any\\nsuch excess may be transferred to the general fund of the city.\\n  10. Reference in this section to a bureau or department of real estate\\nor to a commissioner or chief executive of a bureau or department of\\nreal estate of a municipality, when used in connection with or affecting\\neither a receiver or a multiple dwelling in the city of New York, shall\\nbe construed to mean the department or commissioner of housing\\npreservation and development or the department or commissioner of\\nbuildings, or both such departments or commissioners, as the case may\\nbe, of the city of New York.\\n  11. a. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, where a repair has\\nbeen made by the department pursuant to this section, or any other law,\\nto abate a hazardous condition or correct any violation of this chapter,\\nor any other state or local law, which arises from the existence of lead\\nbased paint, the department may, in whole or in part, waive its right to\\na lien on the affected premises and repayment of such expenses and\\ndisbursements as were necessary to abate such hazardous conditions or\\ncorrect such violation of law. The department shall promulgate rules\\nsetting forth the standards for such waivers.\\n  b. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, where there is a\\nhazardous condition or violation of this chapter or other state or local\\nlaw which arises from the existence of lead based paint, the department\\nmay make grants or loans to owners for the expenses, in whole or in\\npart, of abating such hazardous condition or correcting such violation\\nof law. The department shall promulgate rules setting forth the\\nstandards for such grants or loans.\\n",
