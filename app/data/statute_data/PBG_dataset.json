Except as otherwise provided by special act of the legislature, an\\nauthority shall consist of not less than three nor more than seven\\nmembers. The members of an authority who are first appointed shall be\\nnot more than five in number and shall be designated to serve for terms\\nof one, two, three, four and five years respectively from the date of\\ntheir appointment, depending upon the number of members constituting the\\nauthority. Thereafter the term of office of appointive members shall be\\nfive years. A member shall continue to hold office until his successor\\nis appointed or elected and has qualified. The mayor of a city or\\nvillage, or the town board of a town, shall appoint the appointive\\nmembers, designate the first chairman and file with the commissioner a\\ncertificate of appointment or the reappointment of any member.\\n  3. A majority of the members of an authority shall constitute a\\nquorum.\\n  4. Not more than one member of an authority may be an official or an\\nemployee of the municipality at any one time. In the event that an\\nofficial or an employee of the municipality shall be appointed as a\\nmember of the authority, acceptance or retention of such appointment\\nshall not be deemed a forfeiture of his municipal office or employment,\\nor incompatible therewith or affect his tenure or compensation in any\\nway. The term of office of a member of an authority who is an official\\nof the municipality shall terminate at the expiration of the term of his\\nmunicipal office.\\n  5. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, each authority having\\nsupervision over one hundred or more occupied dwelling units and not\\nlocated in a city having a population of more than one million shall\\ninclude as members two tenants elected by the residents of the\\nauthority's housing for terms of two years each.  Each authority coming\\nwithin the provisions of this subdivision shall, within six months after\\nthe effective date of this act or within six months after the authority\\nbecomes subject to the requirements of this subdivision, adopt by-laws\\nspecifying the time and manner of the election of the tenant\\nrepresentatives. All residents of the authority's housing who are\\neighteen years of age or older shall be eligible to vote. The authority\\nmay provide in the by-laws whether both tenant representatives shall be\\nelected simultaneously for concurrent terms or one shall be elected each\\nyear with the terms overlapping and whether both shall be elected by all\\nthe residents or each one elected by one half of the residents. The\\nfirst election shall be held within one year after the date by which\\nby-laws for the election are required to be adopted. The by-laws shall\\nbe subject to the approval of the commissioner, and if an authority\\nfails within the six-month period to adopt acceptable by-laws for such\\nelection the commissioner shall specify the time and manner of the\\nelection.  Upon the taking of office of the two elected tenant members,\\nthe size of an authority shall be increased by two members and the term\\nof any member appointed pursuant to this subdivision prior to January\\nfirst, nineteen hundred seventy-five shall end and a new member shall be\\nappointed for a term of five years. Acceptance or retention by a tenant\\nof membership on an authority, whether by election or by appointment,\\nshall not be deemed incompatible with, or a forfeiture of his tenancy.\\nAn elected tenant representative shall cease to serve as such upon\\ntermination of his tenancy for any reason, or upon his becoming subject\\nto removal from occupancy due to the operation of section one hundred\\nfifty-six of this chapter. Any compensation paid to an elected or\\nappointed tenant member for his services to an authority shall not\\naffect his eligibility for membership on such authority or for continued\\noccupancy, but may be used in the determination of his rent.

An authority may from time\\nto time for any of the purposes of this chapter borrow money and issue\\nbonds in conformity with applicable provisions of the uniform commercial\\ncode in such amounts and upon such terms as it may deem advisable. Bonds\\nfor state projects and for projects, other than federal projects,\\nfinanced without a loan from a government may be issued for periods not\\nexceeding fifty years and for a period not exceeding the probable life\\nof the project which said period shall be calculated from the date of\\nthe bonds. Bonds for projects financed with the aid of municipal loans\\nmay be issued for periods not exceeding the probable life of the\\nproject. Bonds for federal projects may be issued for a period not\\nexceeding sixty years. An authority shall also have power to issue\\nrefunding bonds for the purpose of paying or retiring bonds previously\\nissued by it but no such refunding bonds shall mature later than the\\nexpiration of the maximum period permitted by this subdivision at the\\ntime of the issuance of the bonds to be refunded for the project for\\nwhich such bonds were issued.  Such period shall be construed to\\ncommence from the date of issuance of the bonds to be refunded.\\n  2. An authority is authorized to issue, whenever it may deem it\\nnecessary so to do, notes in conformity with applicable provisions of\\nthe uniform commercial code without limitation as to the rate or rates\\nof interest in anticipation of the sale of bonds of which a government\\nshall have agreed to purchase at least eighty per centum or which shall\\nhave been authorized at the time such notes are issued or in\\nanticipation of a loan which a government shall have agreed to make to\\nthe authority. Such notes shall mature within a period not to exceed one\\nyear from the date of their issue but may be made subject to the right\\nof earlier payment. The proceeds of the sale of such notes shall be used\\nonly for the purposes for which may be used the proceeds of the sale of\\nbonds or of the loan in anticipation of which the notes were issued. Any\\nsuch notes may be renewed or may be refunded through the sale of similar\\nnotes but no such renewal or refunding notes shall be issued after the\\nsale of bonds. Such notes, renewal notes or refunding notes shall, with\\nthe interest thereon, if any, be paid from funds made available by a\\ngovernment pursuant to agreement for the purchase of bonds or the making\\nof a loan, or from the proceeds of the sale of the bonds in anticipation\\nof the sale of which the notes were issued or, in the event of the sale\\nof the project with respect to which such notes were issued, from the\\npurchase price paid to the authority by the purchaser of such project.\\nSuch notes, renewal notes or refunding notes shall mature within a\\nperiod not to exceed one year beyond the maturity date of the last\\nmaturing notes outstanding on the date when the authority or, in the\\ncase of state projects, the commissioner, makes the determination that\\nthe project has been completed and that the project cost has been\\nfinally determined, which determination shall be conclusive in any suit,\\naction or proceeding upon such notes, renewal notes or refunding notes.\\nThe total amount of such notes or renewals thereof issued and\\noutstanding shall at no time exceed the total amount of bonds of which a\\ngovernment shall have agreed to purchase at least eighty per centum or\\nwhich shall have been authorized to be issued or the total amount of the\\nloan which a government shall have agreed to make to the authority.

Every note issued in connection with a\\nfederal project which is not refunded and any renewals thereof and every\\nrefunding note and any renewals thereof shall, with the interest\\nthereon, if any, be paid either from funds made available by the federal\\ngovernment or agency or instrumentality thereof pursuant to an agreement\\nfor the purchase of bonds or the making of a loan or the payment of\\nannual contributions, or from the proceeds of the sale of the bonds in\\nanticipation of the sale of which the notes were issued.\\n  3. The authority may issue its interim certificates, or other\\ntemporary obligations, in conformity with applicable provisions of the\\nuniform commercial code, to the purchaser of bonds pending the\\nauthorization, preparation, execution or delivery of definitive bonds.\\nSuch interim certificates, or other temporary obligations, shall be in\\nsuch form, contain such terms, conditions and provisions, bear such date\\nor dates, and evidence such agreements relating to their discharge or\\npayment or the delivery of definitive bonds as the authority may by\\nresolution determine.\\n  4. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in subdivision\\ntwo of this section respecting limitations upon the time of payment of\\nnotes, renewal notes or refunding notes, such notes may be issued during\\nthe period that negotiations for the sale of a project pursuant to the\\nprovisions of the public housing law or the private housing finance law\\nare pending, but such notes shall not be renewed or refunded beyond the\\nmaturity date of the last maturing notes outstanding on the date of\\ntransfer of title to such project by the authority to the purchaser.\\nNegotiations for the sale of a project shall be deemed to be pending if\\nthe authority shall have adopted a resolution determining that the\\nnegotiations for the sale of such project are pending. If the\\nnegotiations for such sale are thereafter abandoned, such notes, renewal\\nnotes or refunding notes shall mature within a period not to exceed one\\nyear beyond the maturity date of the last maturing notes outstanding on\\nthe date determined by resolution adopted by the authority as the date\\nwhen negotiations for the sale of the project were abandoned, or within\\na period not to exceed one year beyond the maturity date of the last\\nmaturing notes outstanding on the date when the determination is made\\npursuant to subdivision two of this section that the project has been\\ncompleted and that the project cost has been finally determined,\\nwhichever period is longer.\\n",

To initiate a condemnation\\nproceeding, an authority may adopt a resolution describing the property\\nand declaring that the acquisition of the property is in the public\\ninterest and necessary for the public use, and that the property sought\\nto be condemned is or will be required for a project. A certified copy\\nof the authority's resolution shall be conclusive evidence as to the\\nmatters contained therein in any condemnation proceeding to acquire the\\nproperty, or any part thereof, described in such resolution.\\n  2. An authority may exercise the power of condemnation pursuant to the\\nprovisions of the eminent domain procedure law.\\n  3. An authority may petition the municipality to institute proceedings\\nunder any applicable general, special or local law, to acquire property\\ndescribed in the petition which the authority has certified to be\\nnecessary for a project. The resolution granting the petition shall set\\nforth the amount to be paid by the authority to the municipality for\\nsuch property or in lieu thereof that the authority shall pay to the\\nmunicipality all sums expended or required to be expended by the\\nmunicipality in the acquisition thereof, and the time of payment and\\nmanner of securing payment thereof, and may require that the\\nmunicipality shall receive, before proceeding with the acquisition of\\nsuch property, such assurances as to payment or reimbursement by the\\nauthority or otherwise as the municipality may deem advisable.  Upon the\\npassage of a resolution by the local legislative body of the\\nmunicipality granting the petition, the authority shall cause three\\ncopies of surveys or maps of the property described in the petition to\\nbe made, one of which shall be filed in the office of the authority, one\\nin the office of the corporation counsel or chief law officer of the\\nmunicipality, and one in the office in which instruments affecting real\\nproperty in the county are recorded. The filing of such copies of\\nsurveys or maps shall be conclusive evidence of the acceptance by the\\nauthority of the terms and conditions of such resolution. The\\nmunicipality may proceed under the eminent domain procedure law to\\nacquire title to such property. When title to the property shall have\\nvested in the municipality, it shall convey the same to the authority\\nupon payment by the authority of the sums and the giving of the security\\nrequired by the resolution granting the petition. As soon as title shall\\nhave vested in the municipality, the authority may, upon the\\nauthorization of the mayor, enter upon the property taken, take over and\\ndispose of existing improvements, and carry out the terms of the project\\nwith respect thereto. Whenever in connection with condemnation\\nproceedings, requirement is made in any applicable general, special or\\nlocal law for the performance of an act by a department or officer of\\nthe municipality, it shall be regarded for the purposes of this section\\nas compliance therewith if with the approval of the mayor such act is\\nperformed by the authority or by persons specially designated by it.\\n  4.

At any\\nstage of the proceeding, the court or tribunal may require such prior\\nnotice to be given of an intention to introduce evidence as to the sale,\\noption, leasing or tenancy of property other than the property directly\\ninvolved in the proceeding and of particulars relating thereto as it may\\ndeem necessary to prevent surprise.\\n  (b) The deposition of any person, whether or not a party, may be taken\\nin the manner provided for any civil action and the provisions of this\\nsection. Such deposition may be taken upon any question or issue in the\\nproceeding, including the facts as to any sale, option, lease or tenancy\\nadmissible in evidence pursuant to this subdivision. The deposition may\\nbe taken at the instance of the authority, the municipality or of any\\nowner or at the direction of the court, at any time during the pendency\\nof the action or proceeding. At least five days' notice, or if service\\nis through the mails, at least eight days' notice, shall be given of the\\ntaking of the testimony, if on the part of an owner, to the authority\\nand to all other owners who have appeared in the proceeding; if by the\\nauthority or a municipality, to all owners who have appeared in the\\nproceeding.\\n  (c) Any time during the pendency of such action or proceedings, an\\nauthority, municipality or an owner may apply to the court for an order\\ndirecting an owner or the authority or the municipality, as the case may\\nbe, to show cause why further proceedings should not be expedited, and\\nthe court may upon such application make an order requiring that the\\nhearings proceed and that any other steps be taken with all possible\\nexpedition.\\n  (d) For the purposes of this article, the award of compensation shall\\nnot be increased by reason of any increase in the value of the property\\ncaused by the clearance, reconstruction or proposed clearance or\\nreconstruction for the purposes of this chapter of the property or of\\nthe area in which the property is situated. No allowance shall be made\\nfor improvements begun on property after notice to the owner of such\\nproperty of the institution of the proceedings to condemn such property.\\n  (e) Evidence shall be admissible bearing upon the insanitary, unsafe\\nor substandard condition of the premises, or the illegal use thereof, or\\nthe enhancement of rentals from such illegal use, and such evidence may\\nbe considered in fixing the compensation to be paid, notwithstanding\\nthat no steps to remedy or abate such conditions have been taken by the\\ndepartment or officers having jurisdiction. If a violation order is on\\nfile against the premises in any such department, it shall constitute\\nprima facie evidence of the existence of the condition specified in such\\norder.\\n  (f) If any of the property included within the project is devoted to a\\npublic use, it may nevertheless be acquired provided that no property\\nbelonging to the municipality or to any government may be acquired\\nwithout its consent, and no property belonging to a public utility\\ncorporation may be acquired without the approval of the commission or\\nother officer or tribunal having regulatory power over such corporation.\\n  (g) Upon the trial, evidence of the price and other terms upon a sale\\nor assignment or of a contract for the sale or assignment of a mortgage,\\naward, proposed award, transfer of a tax lien or lien of a judgment\\nrelating to property taken, shall be relevant, material and competent,\\nupon the issue of value or damage and shall be admissible on direct\\nexamination.\\n  (h) Upon the trial a statement, affidavit, deposition, report,\\ntranscript of testimony in an action or proceeding, or appraisal made or\\ngiven by any owner or prior owner of the premises taken, or by any\\nperson on his behalf, to any court, governmental bureau, department or\\nagency respecting the value of the property for tax purposes, shall be\\nrelevant, material and competent upon the issue of value or damage and\\nshall be admissible on direct examination.\\n  (i) The term \"owner\", as used in this section, shall include a person\\nhaving an estate, interest or easement in the property to be acquired or\\na lien, charge or encumbrance thereon.\\n",

Such\\napplication shall be in the form of a petition setting forth grounds,\\nincluding that the cooperation by petitioner with the grand jury at the\\ntime of the refusal was such, and the amount and degree of control and\\nfinancial interest, if any, in the petitioning firm, partnership or\\ncorporation by the member, partner, officer or director who refused to\\nwaive immunity is such that it will not be in the public interest to\\ncancel or terminate petitioner's contracts or subcontracts or to\\ncontinue the disqualification, as provided in subdivisions two and three\\nof this section.\\n  A copy of the petition and accompanying papers shall be served with\\nthe notices to be given pursuant to this subdivision.\\n  (b) Upon the filing of such petition the court may stay as to\\npetitioner, pending a decision upon the petition, the cancellation or\\ntermination of any contracts or subcontracts resulting from such refusal\\nupon such terms as to notice or otherwise as may be just.\\n  (c) At least two days prior to the return day, the officer who\\nconducted the investigation before the grand jury and the attorney\\ngeneral may file answers to the petition or apply for an order\\ndismissing the petition as a matter of law. On or before the return day\\nthe petitioner may file a reply to the answer.\\n  (d) Upon the return day the court may, upon the petition and answer\\nand other papers filed, forthwith render such final order as the case\\nrequires, or if a triable issue of fact is duly raised, it shall\\nforthwith be tried before a court sitting without a jury or before a\\nreferee. The provisions of statute or rule governing references in an\\naction shall apply to a reference under this subdivision.\\n  (e) The court shall render a final order dismissing the petition on\\nthe merits or discontinuing the disqualification upon the ground that\\nthe public interest would be served by its discontinuance, and granting\\nsuch other relief as to the cancellation or termination of contracts or\\nsubcontracts as may be appropriate, but without costs to petitioner.\\n  5.

The rent of such person or family\\nshall be increased in accordance with its ability to pay, the amount of\\nsuch increase to be prescribed by the authority.\\n  7. A municipal housing authority created and established for a city of\\none hundred thousand or more shall grant a preference in the selection\\nof tenants to members of a police force of such city provided that such\\nmembers otherwise qualify for occupancy in its projects and provided,\\nfurther, that such city has adopted a local law authorizing such\\npreference.\\n",

This duty to\\nprovide for a defense and indemnification shall not arise where such\\ncivil action or proceeding is brought by or on behalf of the New York\\ncity housing authority against the employee. A member of the New York\\ncity housing authority police force, when within the geographical limits\\nof his or her jurisdiction, although excused from official duty at the\\ntime, for the purposes of this section, shall be deemed to be acting in\\nthe discharge of duty when engaged in the immediate and actual\\nperformance of a public duty imposed by law and such public duty\\nperformed was for the benefit of all the citizens of the community, and\\nthe New York city housing authority derived no special benefit in its\\ncorporate capacity.\\n  3.

                  "text" : "  § 402-b. Power of authority to enter into mixed-finance transactions\\nto continue viability of public housing. 1. Legislative findings and\\ndeclaration. The legislature finds and declares that the state has a\\nvital interest in the continued viability of public housing. It is\\nnecessary to ensure that public housing continues to serve low-income\\nindividuals and families who would otherwise face homelessness or be\\nforced into unsafe or unsanitary housing. Public housing functions as a\\nsafety net for persons most in need of safe, decent and affordable\\nhousing. The legislature further finds that the New York city housing\\nauthority has made, and continues to make, a concerted effort to provide\\npublic housing to individuals and families in need. Certain projects\\nowned by the New York city housing authority have suffered deterioration\\nover time, and the housing authority does not have sufficient resources\\nto address this deterioration. An infusion of private capital is\\nnecessary to ensure the continued success and long term viability of\\nthese projects. The legislature further finds that bringing state\\nfinanced public housing operated by the New York city housing authority\\nwithin the public housing subsidized by the federal government, by\\nutilizing the federal American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009,\\nwill allow the New York city housing authority to enter into mixed\\nfinance transactions, which will result in receiving new operating and\\ncapital subsidies from the federal government and preserve the units as\\npublic housing. The legislature also finds that tenants living in the\\nprojects that have been financed by the city of New York, commonly known\\nas Marble Hill Houses, St. Mary's Park Houses, Bay View Houses,\\nBoulevard Houses, Linden Houses and Samuel Houses, located in the city\\nof New York, counties of Bronx, Kings and New York, will, through\\nmultiple contracts and agreements among the New York city housing\\nauthority, investment partners and the federal government, be afforded\\nthe same protections as tenants living in the projects listed in\\nsubdivision two of this section. The legislature therefore finds and\\ndeclares that enactment of this section would enable redevelopment and\\nrehabilitation of those certain New York state and New York city\\nfinanced projects owned by the New York city housing authority, and the\\ncontinued operation of said projects for persons and families of low\\nincome.\\n  2. Upon approval by the commissioner of the division of housing and\\ncommunity renewal, the New York city housing authority is hereby\\nauthorized to sell or lease all or part of the residential buildings\\nwithin the projects commonly known as Marlboro Houses, Chelsea Houses,\\nCastle Hill Houses, 344 East 28th Street, Amsterdam Addition, Bushwick\\nHouses, Stephen Wise Towers, Arthur H. Murphy Houses, Baychester Houses,\\nJonathan Williams Plaza, Drew-Hamilton Houses, Independence Towers,\\nRutgers Houses, Stapleton Houses and Manhattanville Houses, located in\\nthe city of New York, counties of Bronx, Kings, New York and Richmond,\\nupon such terms and conditions and in such manner as the New York city\\nhousing authority may deem appropriate and in compliance with the\\nprovisions of this section. The commissioner of the division of housing\\nand community renewal shall not grant such approval unless he or she\\nmakes a finding that such sale or lease will enable the projects to be\\nredeveloped and operated in such manner as to provide decent, safe and\\nsanitary housing within the financial reach of persons and families of\\nlow income and a further finding that new federal assistance is\\nsignificantly more likely to be available to the projects listed in this\\nsection if such approval is granted. There shall be no requirement for a\\nfinding by the commissioner of the division of housing and community\\nrenewal that provisions have been made to pay or otherwise assure\\npayment or retirement of all bonds, notes and other obligations\\nheretofore issued to finance the projects or a portion thereof, provided\\nthat the sale or lease of the projects is part of a comprehensive plan\\nof rehabilitation and/or restructuring which includes the provision of\\nhousing for persons and families of low income. The sale or lease of all\\nor part of the residential buildings within the projects enumerated in\\nthis section shall be made subject to all pertinent federal statutory,\\nexecutive orders, consent orders and regulatory requirements, as those\\nrequirements may be amended from time to time, and contracts and\\nagreements which shall be recorded against and which shall run with the\\nland, including a regulatory and operating agreement and a declaration\\nof restrictive covenants requiring the operation and maintenance of such\\nresidential projects in compliance with federal requirements, and\\namendments to a certain mixed-finance amendment to the consolidated\\nannual contributions contract between the New York city housing\\nauthority and the United States department of housing and urban\\ndevelopment (collectively, the \"applicable public housing\\nrequirements\").\\n  3. (a) All applicable public housing requirements pertaining to\\nfederal public housing projects shall apply to the projects listed in\\nsubdivision two of this section, including but not limited to all\\nprocedural and substantive due process requirements, restrictions on\\nevictions except for just cause, the right to automatic renewals of\\nleases, and the right to meaningful input in matters concerning tenants;\\nSection 8 units shall be subject to the voluntary conversion agreement\\nand management plan approved by the United States department of housing\\nand urban development on September eleventh, two thousand eight, and as\\nit may be amended from time to time.

All\\nother units shall upon vacancy be rented by persons or families whose\\nincome does not exceed eighty percent of area median income at a rent,\\nincluding utilities, not to exceed thirty percent of the household's\\nadjusted gross income.

All\\nprospective public housing tenants shall be taken from the waiting list\\nin the order in which they applied for the size appropriate unit,\\nsubject however to preferences and priorities provided for in the public\\nhousing law and all applicable rules and regulations.\\n  (f) The entity that acts as the managing member or general partner of\\nthe respective owner of each project listed in subdivision two of this\\nsection following transfer of such project, shall at all times be a\\nnot-for-profit housing development fund corporation wholly owned by the\\nNew York city housing authority and shall be established under article\\neleven of the private housing finance law. The board of directors of\\nsuch housing development fund corporation shall be composed of the\\nchairperson of the New York city housing authority and the duly\\nappointed members of such authority.\\n  (g) The entity that owns any project or assists in the management of\\nany project may include an entity exempt from federal income taxes under\\nsection 501(c)3 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 as amended, or its\\nwholly owned subsidiary.\\n  (h) The provisions of this section may be enforced by any party\\naggrieved by a violation of such provisions.\\n  (i) In the case where there is an allocation of federal low income\\nhousing tax credits in connection with a sale or lease of the project,\\nthe fee payable to the project developer shall not exceed twelve percent\\nof the total development cost, provided however, that the fee payable to\\nsuch developer may be increased to the maximum percentage permitted\\nunder regulations promulgated by the division of housing and community\\nrenewal if the developer assumes additional financial risk. Such\\nincrease shall not be granted (i) for risk the developer is customarily\\nrequired to assume or guarantees which the developer is customarily\\nrequired to provide by industry practice, (ii) for any risks or\\nguarantees which parties other than the developer would ultimately bear,\\nor (iii) if the cost of such risks or guarantees would be paid from\\ngovernmental grants, loans, subsidies or other governmental funds.
