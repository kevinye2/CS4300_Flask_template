The legislature\\nhereby finds that a serious public emergency continues to exist in the\\nhousing of a considerable number of persons in the state of New York\\nwhich emergency was created by war, the effects of war and the aftermath\\nof hostilities; that such emergency necessitated the intervention of\\nfederal, state and local government in order to prevent speculative,\\nunwarranted and abnormal increases in rents; that there continues to\\nexist an acute shortage of dwellings; that unless residential rents and\\nevictions continue to be regulated and controlled, disruptive practices\\nand abnormal conditions will produce serious threats to the public\\nhealth, safety and general welfare; that to prevent such perils to\\nhealth, safety and welfare, preventive action by the legislature\\ncontinues to be imperative; that such action is necessary in order to\\nprevent exactions of unjust, unreasonable and oppressive rents and\\nrental agreements and to forestall profiteering, speculation and other\\ndisruptive practices tending to produce threats to the public health;\\nthat the transition from regulation to a normal market of free\\nbargaining between landlord and tenant, while still the objective of\\nstate policy, must be administered with due regard for such emergency;\\nthat in order to prevent uncertainty, hardship and dislocation, the\\nprovisions of this act are declared to be necessary and designed to\\nprotect the public health, safety and general welfare.\\n  2. The provisions of this act, and all regulations, orders and\\nrequirements thereunder shall remain in full force and effect\\nthereafter.\\n",

Whenever the commission determines that such action is necessary to\\neffectuate the purposes of this act, it may also establish maximum rents\\nfor housing accommodations, as that term is defined herein, in\\nmunicipalities in which no maximum rent was in effect on March first,\\nnineteen hundred fifty. Any housing accommodation for which a maximum\\nrent is so established shall be deemed a housing accommodation for all\\nthe purposes, and subject to all the provisions of this act.\\n  2-a.

Provision shall be made pursuant\\nto regulations prescribed by the commission, for individual adjustment\\nof maximum rents where the rental income from a property yields a net\\nannual return of less than seven and one-half per centum of the\\nvaluation of the property. Such valuation shall be the current assessed\\nvaluation established by a city, town or village, which is in effect at\\nthe time of the filing of the application for an adjustment under this\\nsubparagraph properly adjusted by applying thereto the ratio which such\\nassessed valuation bears to the full valuation as determined by the\\nstate board of equalization and assessment on the basis of assessment\\nrolls of cities, towns and villages for the year nineteen hundred\\nfifty-four and certified for such year by such board pursuant to section\\nforty-nine-d of the tax law; provided, however, that where at the time\\nof the filing of the application for an adjustment under this\\nsubparagraph such board has computations for such year indicating a\\ndifferent ratio for subclasses of residential property in a city, town\\nor village, the commission shall give due consideration to such\\ndifferent ratio except ratios in excess of one hundred percent,\\nprovided, further, that where such board has not determined and\\ncertified any ratio pursuant to such section of such law for a city,\\ntown or village for such year, the commission shall apply the ratio\\ndetermined or certified by such board pursuant to section twelve hundred\\ntwelve of the real property tax law for the most recent year; except\\nwhere there has been a bona fide sale of the property within the period\\nbetween March fifteenth, nineteen hundred fifty-seven, and the time of\\nthe filing of the application, as the result of a transaction at arms'\\nlength, on normal financing terms at a readily ascertainable price and\\nunaffected by special circumstances such as a forced sale, exchange of\\nproperty, package deal, wash sale or sale to cooperative; provided,\\nhowever, that where there has been more than one such bona fide sale\\nwithin a period of two years prior to the date of the filing of such\\napplication the commission shall disregard the most recent of such sales\\nif a prior sale within such two-year period was adopted as the valuation\\nof the property in a proceeding under this subparagraph. In determining\\nwhether a sale was on normal financing terms, the commission shall give\\ndue consideration to the following factors:\\n  (i) The ratio of the cash payment received by the seller to (a) the\\nsales price of the property and (b) the annual gross income from the\\nproperty;\\n  (ii) The total amount of the outstanding mortgages which are liens\\nagainst the property (including purchase money mortgages) as compared\\nwith the equalized assessed valuation of the property;\\n  (iii) The ratio of the sales price to the annual gross income of the\\nproperty, with consideration given to the total amount of rent\\nadjustments previously granted, exclusive of rent adjustments because of\\nchanges in dwelling space, services, furniture, furnishings or\\nequipment, major capital improvements, or substantial rehabilitation;\\n  (iv) The presence of deferred amortization in purchase money\\nmortgages, or the assignment of such mortgages at a discount;\\n  (v) Any other facts and circumstances surrounding such sale which, in\\nthe judgment of the commission, may have a bearing upon the question of\\nfinancing.\\n  No application for adjustment of maximum rent based upon a sales price\\nvaluation shall be filed by the landlord under this subparagraph prior\\nto six months from the date of such sale of the property. In addition,\\nno adjustment ordered by the commission based upon such sales price\\nvaluation shall be effective prior to one year from the date of such\\nsale. Where, however, the assessed valuation of the land exceeds four\\ntimes the assessed valuation of the buildings thereon, the commission\\nmay determine a valuation of the property equal to five times the\\nequalized assessed valuation of the buildings, for the purposes of this\\nsubparagraph. The commission may make a determination that the valuation\\nof the property is an amount different from such equalized assessed\\nvaluation where there is a request for a reduction in such assessed\\nvaluation currently pending; or where there has been a reduction in the\\nassessed valuation for the year next preceding the effective date of the\\ncurrent assessed valuation in effect at the time of the filing of the\\napplication. Net annual return shall be the amount by which the earned\\nincome exceeds the operating expenses of the property, excluding\\nmortgage interest and amortization, and excluding allowances for\\nobsolescence and reserves, but including an allowance for depreciation\\nof two per centum of the value of the buildings exclusive of the land,\\nor the amount shown for depreciation of the buildings in the latest\\nrequired federal income tax return, whichever is lower; provided,\\nhowever, that (1) no allowance for depreciation of the buildings shall\\nbe included where the buildings have been fully depreciated for federal\\nincome tax purposes or on the books of the owner; or (2) the landlord\\nwho owns no more than four rental units within the state has not been\\nfully compensated by increases in rental income sufficient to offset\\nunavoidable increases in property taxes, fuel, utilities, insurance and\\nrepairs and maintenance, excluding mortgage interest and amortization,\\nand excluding allowances for depreciation, obsolescence and reserves,\\nwhich have occurred since the federal date determining the maximum rent\\nor the date the property was acquired by the present owner, whichever is\\nlater; or (3) the landlord operates a hotel or rooming house or owns a\\ncooperative apartment and has not been fully compensated by increases in\\nrental income from the controlled housing accommodations sufficient to\\noffset unavoidable increases in property taxes and other costs as are\\nallocable to such controlled housing accommodations, including costs of\\noperation of such hotel or rooming house, but excluding mortgage\\ninterest and amortization, and excluding allowances for depreciation,\\nobsolescence and reserves, which have occurred since the federal date\\ndetermining the maximum rent or the date the landlord commenced the\\noperation of the property, whichever is later; or (4) the landlord and\\ntenant voluntarily enter into a valid written lease in good faith with\\nrespect to any housing accommodation, which lease provides for an\\nincrease in the maximum rent not in excess of fifteen per centum and for\\na term of not less than two years, except that where such lease provides\\nfor an increase in excess of fifteen per centum, the increase shall be\\nautomatically reduced to fifteen per centum; or (5) the landlord and\\ntenant by mutual voluntary written informed agreement agree to a\\nsubstantial increase or decrease in dwelling space, furniture,\\nfurnishings or equipment provided in the housing accommodations;\\nprovided that an owner shall be entitled to a rent increase where there\\nhas been a substantial modification or increase of dwelling space, or\\ninstallation of new equipment or improvements or new furniture or\\nfurnishings provided in or to a tenant's housing accommodation. The\\ntemporary increase in the maximum rent for the affected housing\\naccommodation shall be one-one hundred sixty-eighth, in the case of a\\nbuilding with thirty-five or fewer housing accommodations, or one-one\\nhundred eightieth, in the case of a building with more than thirty-five\\nhousing accommodations where such increase takes effect on or after the\\neffective date of the chapter of the laws of two thousand nineteen that\\namended this subparagraph, of the total actual cost incurred by the\\nlandlord up to fifteen thousand dollars in providing such reasonable and\\nverifiable modification or increase in dwelling space, furniture,\\nfurnishings, or equipment, including the cost of installation but\\nexcluding finance charges and any costs that exceed reasonable costs\\nestablished by rules and regulations promulgated by the division of\\nhousing and community renewal. Such rules and regulations shall include:\\n(i) requirements for work to be done by licensed contractors and a\\nprohibition on common ownership between the landlord and the contractor\\nor vendor; and (ii) a requirement that the owner resolve within the\\ndwelling space all outstanding hazardous or immediately hazardous\\nviolations of the uniform fire prevention and building code (Uniform\\nCode), New York city fire code, or New York city building and housing\\nmaintenance codes, if applicable. Provided further that an owner who is\\nentitled to a rent increase pursuant to this clause shall not be\\nentitled to a further rent increase based upon the installation of\\nsimilar equipment, or new furniture or furnishings within the useful\\nlife of such new equipment, or new furniture or furnishings. Provided\\nfurther that the recoverable costs incurred by the landlord, pursuant to\\nthis subparagraph, shall be limited to an aggregate cost of fifteen\\nthousand dollars that may be expended on no more than three separate\\nindividual apartment improvements in a fifteen year period beginning\\nwith the first individual apartment improvement on or after June\\nfourteenth, two thousand nineteen. Provided further that increases to\\nthe legal regulated rent pursuant to this paragraph shall be removed\\nfrom the legal regulated rent thirty years from the date the increase\\nbecame effective inclusive of any increases granted by the applicable\\nrent guidelines board. The owner shall give written notice to the\\ncommission of any such adjustment pursuant to this clause; or (6) there\\nhas been, since March first, nineteen hundred fifty, an increase in the\\nrental value of the housing accommodations as a result of a substantial\\nrehabilitation of the building or housing accommodation therein which\\nmaterially adds to the value of the property or appreciably prolongs its\\nlife, excluding ordinary repairs, maintenance and replacements; or (7)\\nthere has been since March first, nineteen hundred fifty, a major\\ncapital improvement essential for the preservation, energy efficiency,\\nfunctionality, or infrastructure of the entire building, improvement of\\nthe structure including heating, windows, plumbing and roofing, but\\nshall not be for operational costs or unnecessary cosmetic improvements;\\nwhich for any order of the commissioner issued after the effective date\\nof the chapter of the laws of two thousand nineteen that amended this\\nparagraph the cost of such improvement shall be amortized over a\\ntwelve-year period for buildings with thirty-five or fewer units or a\\ntwelve and one-half year period for buildings with more than thirty-five\\nunits, and shall be removed from the legal regulated rent thirty years\\nfrom the date the increase became effective inclusive of any increases\\ngranted by the applicable rent guidelines board. Temporary major capital\\nimprovement increases shall be collectible prospectively on the first\\nday of the first month beginning sixty days from the date of mailing\\nnotice of approval to the tenant. Such notice shall disclose the total\\nmonthly increase in rent and the first month in which the tenant would\\nbe required to pay the temporary increase. An approval for a temporary\\nmajor capital improvement increase shall not include retroactive\\npayments. The collection of any increase shall not exceed two percent in\\nany year from the effective date of the order granting the increase over\\nthe rent set forth in the schedule of gross rents, with collectability\\nof any dollar excess above said sum to be spread forward in similar\\nincrements and added to the rent as established or set in future years.\\nUpon vacancy, the landlord may add any remaining balance of the\\ntemporary major capital improvement increase to the legal regulated\\nrent. Notwithstanding any other provision of the law, for any renewal\\nlease commencing on or after June 14, 2019, the collection of any rent\\nincreases due to any major capital improvements approved on or after\\nJune 16, 2012 and before June 16, 2019 shall not exceed two percent in\\nany year for any tenant in occupancy on the date the major capital\\nimprovement was approved; provided, however, where an application for a\\ntemporary major capital improvement increase has been filed, a tenant\\nshall have sixty days from the date of mailing of a notice of a\\nproceeding in which to answer or reply. The state division of housing\\nand community renewal shall provide any responding tenant with the\\nreasons for the division's approval or denial of such application; or\\n(8) there has been since March first, nineteen hundred fifty, in\\nstructures containing more than four housing accommodations, other\\nimprovements made with the express informed consent of the tenants in\\noccupancy of at least seventy-five per centum of the housing\\naccommodations, provided, however, that no adjustment granted hereunder\\nshall exceed two per centum unless the tenants have agreed to a higher\\npercentage of increase, as herein provided; (9) there has been, since\\nMarch first, nineteen hundred fifty, a subletting without written\\nconsent from the landlord or an increase in the number of adult\\noccupants who are not members of the immediate family of the tenant, and\\nthe landlord has not been compensated therefor by adjustment of the\\nmaximum rent by lease or order of the commission or pursuant to the\\nfederal act; or (10) the presence of unique or peculiar circumstances\\nmaterially affecting the maximum rent has resulted in a maximum rent\\nwhich is substantially lower than the rents generally prevailing in the\\nsame area for substantially similar housing accommodations.\\n  In addition to the filing of written statements setting forth the\\nfinal rate of equalization concerning assessment rolls of cities, towns\\nand villages, after determination thereof by the state board of\\nequalization and assessment, with the appropriate officials as now\\nrequired by law, such board shall also file a copy of each such\\nstatement, duly certified, in so far as they relate to cities, towns and\\nvillages subject to rent control pursuant to this act, with the state\\nrent administrator and the chairman of the temporary state commission to\\nstudy rents and rental conditions. Where such board has made\\ncomputations indicating a different ratio for subclasses of residential\\nproperty, such information shall also be filed with such rent\\nadministrator and the chairman of such temporary state commission.\\n  (b) The total of all adjustments ordered by the commission pursuant to\\n(1) and (3) of paragraph (a) of subdivision four hereof for any\\nindividual housing accommodations shall not exceed fifteen per centum\\nfor any twelve month period; provided, however, that in ordering an\\nadjustment pursuant to (1), the commission may waive this limitation\\nwhere a greater increase is necessary to make the earned income of the\\nproperty equal to its operating expense; provided further, however, that\\nthe maximum rents subject to the allocation requirement of paragraph (c)\\nhereof shall be increased by such further additional amount during each\\nsucceeding twelve-month period, not exceeding fifteen per centum of the\\nmaximum rent in effect on the effective date of the original order of\\nadjustment, until the maximum rents for the property shall reflect the\\nnet annual return provided for pursuant to (1) hereof, but in no event,\\nhowever, shall the total increase ordered for a succeeding twelve-month\\nperiod be more than an additional three per centum of the maximum rent\\nin effect on the effective date of the original order of adjustment\\nunless a new application be filed by the landlord.\\n  The commission shall compile and make available for public inspection\\nat reasonable hours at its principal office and at each appropriate\\nlocal office, and shall file with the chairman of the temporary state\\ncommission to study rents and rental conditions the manual of accounting\\nprocedures and advisory bulletins applicable to applications under (1),\\n(2) and (3) hereof, and all amendments thereto.\\n  (c) Any increase in maximum rent shall be apportioned equitably among\\nall the controlled housing accommodations in the property. In making\\nsuch apportionment and in fixing the increases in maximum rents the\\ncommission shall give due consideration (1) to all previous adjustments\\nor increases in maximum rents by lease or otherwise; and (2) to all\\nother income derived from the property, including income from space and\\naccommodations not controlled, or the rental value thereof if vacant or\\noccupied rent-free, so that there is allocated to the controlled housing\\naccommodations therein only that portion of the amount of increase\\nnecessary pursuant to (1), (2) or (3) of paragraph (a) of subdivision\\nfour hereof, as is properly attributable to such controlled\\naccommodations.\\n  (d) No landlord shall be entitled to any increase in the maximum rent\\nunless he certifies that he is maintaining all essential services\\nfurnished or required to be furnished as of the date of the issuance of\\nthe order adjusting the maximum rent and that he will continue to\\nmaintain such services so long as the increase in such maximum rent\\ncontinues in effect; nor shall any landlord be entitled to any increase\\nin the maximum rent in any case where a municipal department having\\njurisdiction certifies that the housing accommodation is a fire hazard\\nor is in a continued dangerous condition or detrimental to life or\\nhealth, or is occupied in violation of law.\\n  (e) Before ordering any adjustment in maximum rents, a reasonable\\nopportunity to be heard thereon shall be accorded the tenant and the\\nlandlord.\\n  5. (a) Whenever in the judgment of the commission such action is\\nnecessary or proper in order to effectuate the purposes of this act, the\\ncommission may, by regulation or order, regulate or prohibit speculative\\nor manipulative practices or renting or leasing practices, including\\npractices relating to recovery of possession, which in the judgment of\\nthe commission are equivalent to or are likely to result in rent\\nincreases inconsistent with the purposes of this act.\\n  (b) Whenever in the judgment of the commission such action is\\nnecessary or proper in order to effectuate the purposes of this act, the\\ncommission may provide regulations to assure the maintenance of the same\\nliving space, essential services, furniture, furnishings and equipment\\nas were provided on the date determining the maximum rent, and the\\ncommission shall have power by regulation or order to decrease the\\nmaximum rent for any housing accommodation with respect to which a\\nmaximum rent is in effect, pursuant to this act if it shall find that\\nthe living space, essential services, furniture, furnishings or\\nequipment to which the tenant was entitled on such date has been\\ndecreased. The amount of the decrease in maximum rent ordered by the\\ncommission under this paragraph shall be reduced by any credit,\\nabatement or offset in rent which the tenant has received pursuant to\\nsection two hundred thirty-five-b of the real property law, that relates\\nto one or more conditions covered by such order.\\n  (c) Whenever any municipal department having jurisdiction certifies\\nthat any housing accommodation is a fire hazard or is in a continued\\ndangerous condition or detrimental to life or health, or is occupied in\\nviolation of law, the commission may issue an order decreasing the\\nmaximum rent of such housing accommodation in such amount as it deems\\nnecessary or proper, until the said municipal department has certified\\nthat the illegal or hazardous condition has been removed.\\n  6. Any regulation or order issued pursuant to this section may be\\nestablished in such form and manner, may contain such classifications\\nand differentiations, and may provide for such adjustments and\\nreasonable exceptions as in the judgment of the commission are necessary\\nor proper in order to effectuate the purposes of this act.

So long as the tenant continues to pay the rent to\\nwhich the landlord is entitled, no tenant shall be removed from any\\nhousing accommodation with respect to which a maximum rent is in effect\\npursuant to this act by action to evict or to recover possession, by\\nexclusion from possession, or otherwise, nor shall any person attempt\\nsuch removal or exclusion from possession notwithstanding the fact that\\nthe tenant has no lease or that his lease, or other rental agreement has\\nexpired or otherwise terminated, notwithstanding any contract, lease\\nagreement or obligation heretofore or hereafter entered into which\\nprovides for surrender of possession, or which otherwise provides\\ncontrary hereto, except on one or more of the following grounds, or\\nunless the landlord has obtained a certificate of eviction pursuant to\\nsubdivision two of this section:\\n  (a) the tenant is violating a substantial obligation of his tenancy\\nother than the obligation to surrender possession of such housing\\naccommodation and has failed to cure such violation after written notice\\nby the landlord that the violation cease within ten days, or within the\\nthree month period immediately prior to the commencement of the\\nproceeding the tenant has wilfully violated such an obligation\\ninflicting serious and substantial injury to the landlord; or\\n  (b) the tenant is committing or permitting a nuisance in such housing\\naccommodation; or is maliciously or by reason of gross negligence\\nsubstantially damaging the housing accommodations; or his conduct is\\nsuch as to interfere substantially with the comfort or safety of the\\nlandlord or of other tenants or occupants of the same or other adjacent\\nbuilding or structure; or\\n  (c) occupancy of the housing accommodations by the tenant is illegal\\nbecause of the requirements of law, and the landlord is subject to civil\\nor criminal penalties therefor, or both; or\\n  (d) the tenant is using or permitting such housing accommodation to be\\nused for an immoral or illegal purpose; or\\n  (e) the tenant who had a written lease or other written rental\\nagreement which terminates on or after May first, nineteen hundred\\nfifty, has refused upon demand of the landlord to execute a written\\nextension or renewal thereof for a further term of like duration not in\\nexcess of one year but otherwise on the same terms and conditions as the\\nprevious lease except in so far as such terms and conditions are\\ninconsistent with this act; or\\n  (f) the tenant has unreasonably refused the landlord access to the\\nhousing accommodations for the purpose of making necessary repairs or\\nimprovements required by law or for the purpose of inspection or of\\nshowing the accommodations to a prospective purchaser, mortgagee or\\nprospective mortgagee, or other person having a legitimate interest\\ntherein; provided, however, that in the latter event such refusal shall\\nnot be ground for removal or eviction if such inspection or showing of\\nthe accommodations is contrary to the provisions of the tenant's lease\\nor other rental agreement.\\n  2. No tenant shall be removed or evicted on grounds other than those\\nstated in subdivision one of this section unless on application of the\\nlandlord the commission shall issue an order granting a certificate of\\neviction in accordance with its rules and regulations, designed to\\neffectuate the purposes of this act, permitting the landlord to pursue\\nhis remedies at law. The commission shall issue such an order whenever\\nit finds that:\\n  (a) the landlord seeks in good faith to recover possession of a\\nhousing accommodation because of immediate and compelling necessity for\\nhis or her own personal use and occupancy as his or her primary\\nresidence or for the use and occupancy of his or her immediate family as\\ntheir primary residence; provided, however, this subdivision shall\\npermit recovery of only one housing accommodation and shall not apply\\nwhere a member of the household lawfully occupying the housing\\naccommodation is sixty-two years of age or older, has been a tenant in a\\nhousing accommodation in that building for fifteen years or more, or has\\nan impairment which results from anatomical, physiological or\\npsychological conditions, other than addiction to alcohol, gambling, or\\nany controlled substance, which are demonstrable by medically acceptable\\nclinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques, and which are expected to\\nbe permanent and which prevent the tenant from engaging in any\\nsubstantial gainful employment; provided, however, that a tenant\\nrequired to surrender a housing accommodation under this paragraph shall\\nhave a cause of action in any court of competent jurisdiction for\\ndamages, declaratory, and injunctive relief against a landlord or\\npurchaser of the premises who makes a fraudulent statement regarding a\\nproposed use of the housing accommodation. In any action or proceeding\\nbrought pursuant to this paragraph a prevailing tenant shall be entitled\\nto recovery of actual damages, and reasonable attorneys' fees; or\\n  (b) the landlord seeks in good faith to recover possession of housing\\naccommodations for which the tenant's lease or other rental agreement\\nhas expired or otherwise terminated, and at the time of termination the\\noccupants of the housing accommodations are subtenants or other persons\\nwho occupied under a rental agreement with the tenant, and no part of\\nthe accommodation is used by the tenant as his dwelling; or\\n  (c) the landlord seeks in good faith to recover possession of the\\nhousing accommodations for the immediate purpose of substantially\\naltering or remodeling them, provided that the landlord shall have\\nsecured such approval therefor as is required by law and the commission\\ndetermines that the issuance of the order granting the certificate of\\neviction is not inconsistent with the purpose of this act; or\\n  (d) the landlord seeks in good faith to recover possession of the\\nhousing accommodations for the immediate purpose of demolishing them and\\nthe commission determines (i) that such demolition is to be used for the\\npurpose of constructing new buildings or structures containing at least\\ntwenty per centum more housing accommodations consisting of\\nself-contained family units than are contained in the structure to be\\ndemolished; provided, however, where as a result of conditions\\ndetrimental to life or health of the tenants, violations have been\\nplaced upon the structure containing the housing accommodations by the\\nlocal authorities having jurisdiction over such matters and the cost of\\nremoving such violations would substantially equal or exceed the\\nassessed valuation of the structure, the new buildings or structures\\nshall only be required to make provision for a greater number of housing\\naccommodations consisting of self-contained family units than are\\ncontained in the structure to be demolished; provided, further, that the\\ncommission may by regulation impose as a condition to granting the\\ncertificates of eviction that the landlord pay stipends to the tenants\\nin such amounts as the commission may determine to be reasonably\\nnecessary, which amounts may vary depending upon the size of the\\ntenant's apartment and whether the tenant accepts relocation by the\\nlandlord; or (ii) that such demolition is made for the purpose of\\nconstructing new buildings or structures other than housing\\naccommodations; provided, however, that within the city of New York the\\ncommission may by regulation impose conditions (including but not\\nlimited to suitable relocation and the payment of stipends) to granting\\nthe certificates of eviction. No order granting the certificates of\\neviction pursuant to this paragraph shall be issued unless the landlord\\nshall have secured such approval therefor as is required by law and the\\ncommission determines that the issuance of such order is not\\ninconsistent with the purpose of this act.\\n  3. The commission may from time to time to effectuate the purposes of\\nthis act adopt, promulgate, amend or rescind such rules, regulations or\\norders as it may deem necessary or proper for the control of evictions.\\nIt may require that an order granting a certificate of eviction be\\nobtained from it prior to the institution of any action or proceeding\\nfor the recovery of possession of any housing accommodation subject to a\\nmaximum rent under this act upon the grounds specified in subdivision\\ntwo of this section or where it finds that the requested removal or\\neviction is not inconsistent with the purposes of this act and would not\\nbe likely to result in the circumvention or evasion thereof; provided,\\nhowever, that no such order shall be required in any action or\\nproceeding brought pursuant to the provisions of subdivision one of this\\nsection.\\n  The commission on its own initiative or on application of a tenant may\\nrevoke or cancel an order granting such certificate of eviction at any\\ntime prior to the execution of a warrant in a summary proceeding to\\nrecover possession of real property by a court whenever it finds that:\\n  (a) the certificate of eviction was obtained by fraud or illegality;\\nor\\n  (b) the landlord's intentions or circumstances have so changed that\\nthe premises, possession of which is sought, will not be used for the\\npurpose specified in the certificate.\\n  The commencement of a proceeding by the commission to revoke or cancel\\nan order granting a certificate of eviction shall stay such order until\\nthe final determination of the proceeding regardless of whether the\\nwaiting period in the order has already expired. In the event the\\ncommission cancels or revokes such an order, the court having\\njurisdiction of any summary proceeding instituted in such case shall\\ntake appropriate action to dismiss the application for removal of the\\ntenant from the real property and to vacate and annul any final order or\\nwarrant granted or issued by the court in the matter.\\n  4. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this section, the\\nstate, any municipality, or housing authority may nevertheless recover\\npossession of any housing accommodations operated by it where such\\naction or proceeding is authorized by statute or regulations under which\\nsuch accommodations are administered.\\n  5. Any order of the commission under this section granting a\\ncertificate of eviction shall be subject to judicial review only in the\\nmanner prescribed by sections eight and nine.\\n  6. Where after the commission has granted a certificate of eviction\\ncertifying that the landlord may pursue his remedies pursuant to local\\nlaw to acquire possession, and a tenant voluntarily removes from a\\nhousing accommodation or has been removed therefrom by action or\\nproceeding to evict from or recover possession of a housing\\naccommodation upon the ground that the landlord seeks in good faith to\\nrecover possession of such accommodations (1) for his immediate and\\npersonal use, or for the immediate and personal use by a member or\\nmembers of his immediate family, and such landlord or members of his\\nimmediate family shall fail to occupy such accommodations within thirty\\ndays after the tenant vacates, or such landlord shall lease or rent such\\nspace or permit occupancy thereof by a third person within a period of\\none year after such removal of the tenant, or (2) for the immediate\\npurpose of withdrawing such housing accommodations from the rental\\nmarket and such landlord shall lease or sell the housing accommodation\\nor the space previously occupied thereby, or permit use thereof in a\\nmanner other than contemplated in such eviction certificate within a\\nperiod of one year after such removal of the tenant, or (3) for the\\nimmediate purpose of altering or remodeling such housing accommodations,\\nand the landlord shall fail to start the work of alteration or\\nremodeling of such housing accommodations within ninety days after such\\nremoval on the ground that he required possession of such accommodations\\nfor the purpose of altering or remodeling the same, or if after having\\ncommenced such work shall fail or neglect to prosecute the work with\\nreasonable diligence, or (4) for the immediate purpose of demolishing\\nsuch housing accommodations and constructing a new building or structure\\nfor a greater number of housing accommodations in accordance with\\napproved plans, or reasonable amendment thereof, and the landlord has\\nfailed to complete the demolition within six months after the removal of\\nthe last tenant or, having demolished the premises, has failed or\\nneglected to proceed with the new construction within ninety days after\\nthe completion of such demolition or (5) for some purpose other than\\nthose specified above for which the removal of the tenant was sought and\\nthe landlord has failed to use the vacated premises for such purpose,\\nsuch landlord shall unless for good cause shown, be liable to the tenant\\nfor three times the damages sustained on account of such removal plus\\nreasonable attorney's fees and costs as determined by the court;\\nprovided, however, that subparagraph (4) herein shall not apply to any\\naction which does not constitute a violation of any local law providing\\nfor penalties upon failure to demolish or comply with state rent control\\neviction certificates. In addition to any other damage, the cost of\\nremoval of property shall be a lawful measure of damage.\\n  7. Any statutory tenant who vacates the housing accommodations,\\nwithout giving the landlord at least thirty days' written notice by\\nregistered or certified mail of his intention to vacate, shall be liable\\nto the landlord for an amount not exceeding one month's rent, except\\nwhere the tenant has been removed or vacates pursuant to the provisions\\nof this section or of subdivision four of section ten of this act. Such\\nnotice shall be postmarked on or before the last day of the rental\\nperiod immediately prior to such thirty-day period.\\n  8. Where after the commission has granted a certificate of eviction\\nauthorizing the landlord to pursue his remedies pursuant to local law to\\nacquire possession for any purpose stated in subdivision two of section\\nfive or in subdivision four of section ten of this act or for some other\\nstated purpose, and a tenant voluntarily removes from a housing\\naccommodation or has been removed therefrom by action or proceeding to\\nevict from or recover possession of a housing accommodation and the\\nlandlord or any successor landlord of the premises does not use the\\nhousing accommodation for the purpose specified in such certificate of\\neviction, the vacated accommodation or any replacement or subdivision\\nthereof shall, unless the commission approves such different purpose, be\\ndeemed a housing accommodation subject to control, notwithstanding any\\ndefinition of that term in this act to the contrary. Such approval shall\\nbe granted whenever the commission finds that the failure or omission to\\nuse the housing accommodation for the purpose specified in such\\ncertificate was not inconsistent with the purposes of this act and would\\nnot be likely to result in the circumvention or evasion thereof. The\\nremedy herein provided for shall be in addition to those provided for in\\nsubdivision one of section eleven of this act and to the tenant's action\\nfor damages provided for in subdivision six of this section.\\n",

The answer shall include a statement\\nsetting forth, so far as practicable, the economic data and other facts\\nof which the commission has taken official notice. Upon the filing of\\nsuch petition the court shall have jurisdiction to set aside such\\nregulation or order, in whole or in part, to dismiss the petition, or to\\nremit the proceeding to the commission; provided, however, that the\\nregulation or order may be modified or rescinded by the commission at\\nany time notwithstanding the pendency of such proceeding for review. No\\nobjection to such regulation or order, and no evidence in support of any\\nobjection thereto, shall be considered by the court, unless such\\nobjection shall have been set forth by the petitioner in the protest or\\nsuch evidence shall be contained in the return. If application is made\\nto the court by either party for leave to introduce additional evidence\\nwhich was either offered and not admitted, or which could not reasonably\\nhave been offered or included in such proceedings before the commission,\\nand the court determines that such evidence should be admitted, the\\ncourt shall order the evidence to be presented to the commission.

Upon final determination of the proceeding before\\nthe court, the original record, if filed by the commission with the\\ncourt, shall be returned to the commission.\\n  2. No such regulation or order shall be enjoined or set aside, in\\nwhole or in part, unless the petitioner shall establish to the\\nsatisfaction of the court that the regulation or order is not in\\naccordance with law, or is arbitrary or capricious.

Notwithstanding any provision of section thirteen\\nhundred four of the civil practice act to the contrary, any order of the\\ncourt remitting the proceeding to the commission may, at the election of\\nthe commission, be subject to review by the appellate division of the\\nsupreme court and the court of appeals in the same manner and form and\\nwith the same effect as provided in the civil practice act for appeals\\nfrom a final order in a special proceeding.

In any action or\\nproceeding wherein a party relies for ground of relief or defense or\\nraises issue or brings into question the construction or validity of\\nthis act or any regulation, order, or requirement thereunder, the court\\nhaving jurisdiction of such action or proceeding may at any stage\\ncertify such fact to the commission. The commission may intervene in any\\nsuch action or proceeding.\\n  5. If any landlord who receives rent from a tenant violates a\\nregulation or order prescribing the maximum rent with respect to the\\nhousing accommodations for which such rent is received from such tenant,\\nthe tenant paying such rent may, within two years from the date of the\\noccurrence of the violation, except as hereinafter provided, bring an\\naction against the landlord on account of the overcharge as hereinafter\\ndefined. In such action, the landlord shall be liable for reasonable\\nattorney's fees and costs as determined by the court, plus whichever of\\nthe following sums is the greater: (a) Such amount not more than three\\ntimes the amount of the overcharge, or the overcharges, upon which the\\naction is based as the court in its discretion may determine, or (b) an\\namount not less than twenty-five dollars nor more than fifty dollars, as\\nthe court in its discretion may determine; provided, however, that such\\namount shall be the amount of the overcharge or overcharges or\\ntwenty-five dollars, whichever is greater, if the defendant proves that\\nthe violation of the regulation or order in question was neither willful\\nnor the result of failure to take practicable precautions against the\\noccurrence of the violation. As used in this section, the word\\n\"overcharge\" shall mean the amount by which the consideration paid by a\\ntenant to a landlord exceeds the applicable maximum rent. If any\\nlandlord who receives rent from a tenant violates a regulation or order\\nprescribing maximum rent with respect to the housing accommodations for\\nwhich such rent is received from such tenant, and such tenant either\\nfails to institute an action under this subdivision within thirty days\\nfrom the date of the occurrence of the violation or is not entitled for\\nany reason to bring the action, the commission may institute an action\\non behalf of the state within such two-year period. If such action is\\ninstituted by the commission, the tenant affected shall thereafter be\\nbarred from bringing an action for the same violation or violations. Any\\naction under this subdivision by either the tenant or the commission, as\\nthe case may be, may be brought in any court of competent jurisdiction.\\nRecovery, by judgment or otherwise, in an action for damages under this\\nsubdivision shall be a bar to the recovery under this subdivision of any\\nrecovery, by judgment or otherwise, in any other action against the same\\nlandlord on account of the same overcharge or overcharges prior to the\\ninstitution of the action in which such recovery of damages was\\nobtained. Where recovery by judgment or otherwise is obtained in an\\naction instituted by the commission under this subdivision, there shall\\nbe paid over to the tenant from the moneys recovered, one-third of such\\nrecovery, exclusive of costs and disbursement or the amount of the\\novercharge or overcharges, whichever is the greater.\\n  6. If any landlord who receives rent from a tenant violates any order\\ncontaining a directive that rent collected by the landlord in excess of\\nthe maximum rent be refunded to the tenant within thirty days, the\\ncommission may, within one year after the expiration of such thirty day\\nperiod or after such order shall become final by regulation of the\\ncommission, bring an action against the landlord on account of the\\nfailure of the landlord to make the prescribed refund. In such action,\\nthe landlord shall be liable for reasonable attorney's fees and costs as\\ndetermined by the court, plus whichever of the following sums is the\\ngreater: (a) Such amount not more than three times the amount directed\\nto be refunded, or the amount directed to be refunded, upon which the\\naction is based as the court in its discretion may determine, or (b) an\\namount not less than twenty-five dollars nor more than fifty dollars, as\\nthe court in its discretion may determine; provided, however, that such\\namount shall be the amount directed to be refunded or twenty-five\\ndollars, whichever is greater, if the defendant proves that the\\nviolation of the order in question was neither willful nor the result of\\nfailure to take practical precautions against the occurrence of the\\nviolation. If the commission fails to institute such action within\\nthirty days from the date of the occurrence of the violation, the tenant\\npaying such rent may thereafter institute an action for the same\\nviolation within such one year period, and the liability of the landlord\\nin such action by the tenant shall be the same as if such action were\\nbrought by the commission. If such action is instituted by the\\ncommission, the tenant affected shall thereafter be barred from bringing\\nan action for the same violation. Any action under this subdivision by\\neither the commission or the tenant, as the case may be, may be brought\\nin any court of competent jurisdiction. Recovery by judgment or\\notherwise in an action under this subdivision based on the failure of\\nthe landlord to make the prescribed refund, shall be a bar to recovery\\nunder this subdivision of any recovery, by judgment or otherwise, from\\nthe same landlord in any other action instituted on account of the same\\nviolation, prior to the institution of the action in which such recovery\\nis obtained. Where recovery by judgment or otherwise, is obtained in an\\naction instituted by the commission under this subdivision, there shall\\nbe paid over to the tenant from the moneys recovered one-third of such\\nrecovery, exclusive of costs and disbursements, or the amount of the\\nprescribed refund, whichever is greater.\\n  7. Any tenant who has vacated his housing accommodations because the\\nlandlord or any person acting on his behalf, with intent to cause the\\ntenant to vacate, engaged in any course of conduct (including, but not\\nlimited to, interruption or discontinuance of essential services) which\\ninterfered with or disturbed or was intended to interfere with or\\ndisturb the comfort, repose, peace or quiet of the tenant in his use or\\noccupancy of the housing accommodations may, within ninety days after\\nvacating, apply to the commission for a determination that the housing\\naccommodations were vacated as a result of such conduct, and may, within\\none year after such determination, institute a civil action against the\\nlandlord by reason of such conduct. In such action the landlord shall be\\nliable to the tenant for three times the damages sustained on account of\\nsuch conduct plus reasonable attorney's fees and costs as determined by\\nthe court. In addition to any other damages the cost of removal of\\nproperty shall be a lawful measure of damages.\\n",
