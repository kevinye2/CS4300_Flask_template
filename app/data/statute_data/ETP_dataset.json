One public member shall be designated by the commissioner to\\nserve as chairman and shall hold no other public office. No member,\\nofficer or employee of any municipal rent regulation agency or the state\\ndivision of housing and community renewal and no person who owns or\\nmanages real estate covered by this law or who is an officer of any\\nowner or tenant organization shall serve on a rent guidelines board.

As soon as practicable after its creation and\\nthereafter not later than July first of each year, a rent guidelines\\nboard shall file with the state division of housing and community\\nrenewal its findings for the preceding calendar year, and shall\\naccompany such findings with a statement of the maximum rate or rates of\\nrent adjustment, if any, for one or more classes of accommodation\\nsubject to this act, authorized for leases or other rental agreements\\ncommencing during the next succeeding twelve months. The standards for\\nrent adjustments may be applicable for the entire county or may be\\nvaried according to such zones or jurisdictions within such county as\\nthe board finds necessary to achieve the purposes of this subdivision. A\\nrent guidelines board shall not establish annual guidelines for rent\\nadjustments based on the current rental cost of a unit or on the amount\\nof time that has elapsed since another rent increase was authorized\\npursuant to this chapter.\\n  The standards for rent adjustments established annually shall be\\neffective for leases commencing on October first of each year and during\\nthe next succeeding twelve months whether or not the board has filed its\\nfindings and statement of the maximum rate or rates of rent adjustment\\nby July first of each year. If such lease is entered into before such\\nfiling by the board, it may provide for the rent to be adjusted by the\\nrates then in effect, subject to change by the applicable rates of rent\\nadjustment when filed, such change to be effective as of the date of the\\ncommencement of the lease. Said lease must provide that, if the new\\nrates of rent adjustment differ for leases of different terms, the\\ntenant has the option of changing the original lease term to any other\\nterm for which a rate of rent adjustment is set by the board, with the\\nrental to be adjusted accordingly.\\n  Where a city, town or village shall act to determine the existence of\\npublic emergency pursuant to section three of this act subsequent to the\\nestablishment of annual guidelines for rent adjustments of the\\naccommodations subject to this act, the rent guidelines board as soon as\\npracticable thereafter shall file its findings and rates of rent\\nadjustment for leases or other rental agreements for the housing\\naccommodations in such a city, town or village, which rates shall be\\neffective for leases or other rental agreements commencing on or after\\nthe effective date of the determination.\\n  c. In a city having a population of one million or more, the rent\\nguidelines board shall be the rent guidelines board established pursuant\\nto the New York city rent stabilization law of nineteen hundred\\nsixty-nine as amemded, and such board shall have the powers granted\\npursuant to the New York city rent stabilization law of nineteen hundred\\nsixty-nine as amended.\\n  d. Maximum rates of rent adjustment shall not be established more than\\nonce annually for any housing accommodation within a board's\\njurisdiction. Once established, no such rate shall, within the one-year\\nperiod, be adjusted by any surcharge, supplementary adjustment or other\\nmodification.\\n  e. Notwithstanding any other provision of this act, the adjustment for\\nvacancy leases covered by the provisions of this act shall be determined\\nexclusively pursuant to section ten of this act. Rent guidelines boards\\nshall no longer promulgate adjustments for vacancy leases.\\n",

The division's notification shall require the tenant or tenants\\nto provide the information to the division within sixty days of service\\nupon such tenant or tenants and shall include a warning in bold faced\\ntype that failure to respond will result in an order being issued by the\\ndivision providing that such housing accommodations shall not be subject\\nto the provisions of this act.\\n  2. If the department of taxation and finance determines that the total\\nannual income is in excess of the deregulation income threshold in each\\nof the two preceding calendar years, the division shall, on or before\\nNovember fifteenth of such year, notify the owner and tenants of the\\nresults of such verification. Both the owner and the tenants shall have\\nthirty days within which to comment on such verification results. Within\\nforty-five days after the expiration of the comment period, the division\\nshall, where appropriate, issue an order providing that such housing\\naccommodation shall not be subject to the provisions of this act upon\\nexpiration of the existing lease. A copy of such order shall be mailed\\nby regular and certified mail, return receipt requested, to the tenant\\nor tenants and a copy thereof shall be sent to the owner.\\n  3. In the event the tenant or tenants fail to provide the information\\nrequired pursuant to paragraph one of this subdivision, the division\\nshall issue, on or before December first of such year, an order\\nproviding that such housing accommodation shall not be subject to the\\nprovisions of this act upon the expiration of the current lease.

Such rental offer shall be made by the owner in\\nwriting to the tenant by certified and regular mail and shall inform the\\ntenant that such offer must be accepted in writing within ten days of\\nreceipt.  The tenant shall respond within ten days after receipt of such\\noffer.

The initial legal regulated rents for housing accommodations in a\\ncity having a population of less than one million or a town or village\\nas to which a declaration of emergency has been made pursuant to this\\nact shall be:\\n  (1) For housing accommodations subject to the emergency housing rent\\ncontrol law which become vacant on or after the local effective date of\\nthis act, the rent agreed to by the landlord and the tenant and reserved\\nin a lease or provided for in a rental agreement; provided that such\\ninitial legal regulated rent may be adjusted on application of the owner\\nor tenant pursuant to subdivision a of section nine of this act; and\\nprovided further that no increase of such initial regulated rent\\npursuant to annual guidelines adopted by the rent guidelines board shall\\nbecome effective until the expiration of the first lease or rental\\nagreement taking effect after the local effective date, but in no event\\nbefore one year from the commencement of such rental agreement.\\n  (2) For all other housing accommodations, the rent reserved in the\\nlast effective lease or other rental agreement; provided that an initial\\nrent based upon the rent reserved in a lease or other rental agreement\\nwhich became effective on or after January first, nineteen hundred\\nseventy-four may be adjusted on application of the tenant pursuant to\\nsubdivision b of section nine of this act or on application of either\\nthe owner or tenant pursuant to subdivision a of such section; and\\nfurther provided that if a lease is entered into for such housing\\naccommodations after the local effective date, but before the effective\\ndate of the first guidelines applicable to such accommodations, the\\nlease may provide for an adjustment of rent pursuant to such guidelines,\\nto be effective on the first day of the month next succeeding the\\neffective date of such guidelines.\\n  c. The initial legal regulated rents for housing accommodations in a\\ncity having a population of one million or more shall be the initial\\nrent established pursuant to the New York city rent stabilization law of\\nnineteen hundred sixty-nine as amended.\\n  d. Provision shall be made pursuant to regulations under this act for\\nindividual adjustment of rents where:\\n  (1) there has been a substantial modification or increase of dwelling\\nspace, or installation of new equipment or improvements or new furniture\\nor furnishings, provided in or to a tenant's housing accommodation, on\\nwritten informed tenant consent to the rent increase. In the case of a\\nvacant housing accommodation, tenant consent shall not be required. The\\ntemporary increase in the legal regulated rent for the affected housing\\naccommodation shall be one-one hundred sixty-eighth, in the case of a\\nbuilding with thirty-five or fewer housing accommodations or one-one\\nhundred eightieth in the case of a building with more than thirty-five\\nhousing accommodations where such increase takes effect on or after the\\neffective date of the chapter of the laws of two thousand nineteen that\\namended this paragraph, of the total actual cost incurred by the\\nlandlord up to fifteen thousand dollars in providing such reasonable and\\nverifiable modification or increase in dwelling space, furniture,\\nfurnishings, or equipment, including the cost of installation but\\nexcluding finance charges and any costs that exceed reasonable costs\\nestablished by rules and regulations promulgated by the division of\\nhousing and community renewal.

Provided\\nfurther that the recoverable costs incurred by the landlord, pursuant to\\nthis paragraph, shall be limited to an aggregate cost of fifteen\\nthousand dollars that may be expended on no more than three separate\\nindividual apartment improvements in a fifteen year period beginning\\nwith the first individual apartment improvement on or after June\\nfourteenth, two thousand nineteen.

The\\nstate division of housing and community renewal shall provide any\\nresponding tenant with the reasons for the division's approval or denial\\nof such application; or\\n  (4) an owner by application to the state division of housing and\\ncommunity renewal for increases in the rents in excess of the rent\\nadjustment authorized by the rent guidelines board under this act\\nestablishes a hardship, and the state division finds that the rate of\\nrent adjustment is not sufficient to enable the owner to maintain\\napproximately the same ratio between operating expenses, including taxes\\nand labor costs but excluding debt service, financing costs, and\\nmanagement fees, and gross rents which prevailed on the average over the\\nimmediate preceding five year period, or for the entire life of the\\nbuilding if less than five years, or\\n  (5) as an alternative to the hardship application provided under\\nparagraph four of this subdivision, owners of buildings acquired by the\\nsame owner or a related entity owned by the same principals three years\\nprior to the date of application may apply to the division for increases\\nin excess of the level of applicable guideline increases established\\nunder this law based on a finding by the commissioner that such\\nguideline increases are not sufficient to enable the owner to maintain\\nan annual gross rent income for such building which exceeds the annual\\noperating expenses of such building by a sum equal to at least five\\npercent of such gross rent. For the purposes of this paragraph,\\noperating expenses shall consist of the actual, reasonable, costs of\\nfuel, labor, utilities, taxes, other than income or corporate franchise\\ntaxes, fees, permits, necessary contracted services and non-capital\\nrepairs, insurance, parts and supplies, management fees and other\\nadministrative costs and mortgage interest. For the purposes of this\\nparagraph, mortgage interest shall be deemed to mean interest on a bona\\nfide mortgage including an allocable portion of charges related thereto.\\nCriteria to be considered in determining a bona fide mortgage other than\\nan institutional mortgage shall include; condition of the property,\\nlocation of the property, the existing mortgage market at the time the\\nmortgage is placed, the term of the mortgage, the amortization rate, the\\nprincipal amount of the mortgage, security and other terms and\\nconditions of the mortgage. The commissioner shall set a rental value\\nfor any unit occupied by the owner or a person related to the owner or\\nunoccupied at the owner's choice for more than one month at the last\\nregulated rent plus the minimum number of guidelines increases or, if no\\nsuch regulated rent existed or is known, the commissioner shall impute a\\nrent consistent with other rents in the building. The amount of hardship\\nincrease shall be such as may be required to maintain the annual gross\\nrent income as provided by this paragraph. The division shall not grant\\na hardship application under this paragraph or paragraph four of this\\nsubdivision for a period of three years subsequent to granting a\\nhardship application under the provisions of this paragraph. The\\ncollection of any increase in the rent for any housing accommodation\\npursuant to this paragraph shall not exceed six percent in any year from\\nthe effective date of the order granting the increase over the rent set\\nforth in the schedule of gross rents, with collectability of any dollar\\nexcess above said sum to be spread forward in similar increments and\\nadded to the rent as established or set in future years. No application\\nshall be approved unless the owner's equity in such building exceeds\\nfive percent of: (i) the arms length purchase price of the property;\\n(ii) the cost of any capital improvements for which the owner has not\\ncollected a surcharge; (iii) any repayment of principal of any mortgage\\nor loan used to finance the purchase of the property or any capital\\nimprovements for which the owner has not collected a surcharge; and (iv)\\nany increase in the equalized assessed value of the property which\\noccurred subsequent to the first valuation of the property after\\npurchase by the owner. For the purposes of this paragraph, owner's\\nequity shall mean the sum of (i) the purchase price of the property less\\nthe principal of any mortgage or loan used to finance the purchase of\\nthe property, (ii) the cost of any capital improvement for which the\\nowner has not collected a surcharge less the principal of any mortgage\\nor loan used to finance said improvement, (iii) any repayment of the\\nprincipal of any mortgage or loan used to finance the purchase of the\\nproperty or any capital improvement for which the owner has not\\ncollected a surcharge, and (iv) any increase in the equalized assessed\\nvalue of the property which occurred subsequent to the first valuation\\nof the property after purchase by the owner.\\n  This subdivision shall apply to accommodations outside a city of one\\nmillion or more.\\n  e.

For cities having a population of less than one\\nmillion and towns and villages, the state division of housing and\\ncommunity renewal shall be empowered to implement this act by\\nappropriate regulations. Such regulations may encompass such speculative\\nor manipulative practices or renting or leasing practices as the state\\ndivision of housing and community renewal determines constitute or are\\nlikely to cause circumvention of this act. Such regulations shall\\nprohibit practices which are likely to prevent any person from asserting\\nany right or remedy granted by this act, including but not limited to\\nretaliatory termination of periodic tenancies and shall require owners\\nto grant a new one or two year vacancy or renewal lease at the option of\\nthe tenant, except where a mortgage or mortgage commitment existing as\\nof the local effective date of this act provides that the owner shall\\nnot grant a one-year lease; and shall prescribe standards with respect\\nto the terms and conditions of new and renewal leases, additional rent\\nand such related matters as security deposits, advance rental payments,\\nthe use of escalator clauses in leases and provision for increase in\\nrentals for garages and other ancillary facilities, so as to ensure that\\nthe level of rent adjustments authorized under this law will not be\\nsubverted and made ineffective. Any provision of the regulations\\npermitting an owner to refuse to renew a lease on grounds that the owner\\nseeks to recover possession of a housing accommodation for his or her\\nown use and occupancy or for the use and occupancy of his or her\\nimmediate family shall permit recovery of only one housing\\naccommodation, shall require that an owner demonstrate immediate and\\ncompelling need and that the housing accommodation will be the proposed\\noccupants' primary residence and shall not apply where a member of the\\nhousing accommodation is sixty-two years of age or older, has been a\\ntenant in a housing accommodation in that building for fifteen years or\\nmore, or has an impairment which results from anatomical, physiological\\nor psychological conditions, other than addiction to alcohol, gambling,\\nor any controlled substance, which are demonstrable by medically\\nacceptable clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques, and which are\\nexpected to be permanent and which prevent the tenant from engaging in\\nany substantial gainful employment; provided, however, that a tenant\\nrequired to surrender a housing accommodation under this subdivision\\nshall have a cause of action in any court of competent jurisdiction for\\ndamages, declaratory, and injunctive relief against a landlord or\\npurchaser of the premises who makes a fraudulent statement regarding a\\nproposed use of the housing accommodation. In any action or proceeding\\nbrought pursuant to this subdivision a prevailing tenant shall be\\nentitled to recovery of actual damages, and reasonable attorneys' fees.\\n  (a-2) Where the amount of rent charged to and paid by the tenant is\\nless than the legal regulated rent for the housing accommodation, the\\namount of rent for such housing accommodation which may be charged upon\\nvacancy thereof, may, at the option of the owner, be based upon such\\npreviously established legal regulated rent, as adjusted by the most\\nrecent applicable guidelines increases and other increases authorized by\\nlaw.  For any tenant who is subject to a lease on or after the effective\\ndate of a chapter of the laws of two thousand nineteen which amended\\nthis subdivision, or is or was entitled to receive a renewal or vacancy\\nlease on or after such date, upon renewal of such lease, the amount of\\nrent for such housing accommodation that may be charged and paid shall\\nbe no more than the rent charged to and paid by the tenant prior to that\\nrenewal, as adjusted by the most recent applicable guidelines increases\\nand any other increases authorized by law. Provided, however, that for\\nbuildings that are subject to this statute by virtue of a regulatory\\nagreement with a local government agency and which buildings receive\\nfederal project based rental assistance administered by the United\\nStates department of housing and urban development or a state or local\\nsection eight administering agency, where the rent set by the federal,\\nstate or local governmental agency is less than the legal regulated rent\\nfor the housing accommodation, the amount of rent for such housing\\naccommodation which may be charged with the approval of such federal,\\nstate or local governmental agency upon renewal or upon vacancy thereof,\\nmay be based upon such previously established legal regulated rent, as\\nadjusted by the most recent applicable guidelines increases or other\\nincreases authorized by law; and further provided that such vacancy\\nshall not be caused by the failure of the owner or an agent of the\\nowner, to maintain the housing accommodation in compliance with the\\nwarranty of habitability set forth in subdivision one of section two\\nhundred thirty-five-b of the real property law.\\n  b. For cities having a population of one million or more, this act may\\nbe implemented by regulations adopted pursuant to the New York city rent\\nstabilization law of nineteen hundred sixty-nine, as amended, or as\\notherwise provided by law.\\n  c.

Nothing contained\\nin this paragraph shall limit the examination of rent history relevant\\nto a determination as to:\\n  (i) whether the legality of a rental amount charged or registered is\\nreliable in light of all available evidence including, but not limited\\nto, whether an unexplained increase in the registered or lease rents, or\\na fraudulent scheme to destabilize the housing accommodation, rendered\\nsuch rent or registration unreliable;\\n  (ii) whether an accommodation is subject to the emergency tenant\\nprotection act;\\n  (iii) whether an order issued by the division of housing and community\\nrenewal or a court of competent jurisdiction, including, but not limited\\nto an order issued pursuant to section seven of this act, or any\\nregulatory agreement or other contract with any governmental agency, and\\nremaining in effect within six years of the filing of a complaint\\npursuant to this section, affects or limits the amount of rent that may\\nbe charged or collected;\\n  (iv) whether an overcharge was or was not willful;\\n  (v) whether a rent adjustment that requires information regarding the\\nlength of occupancy by a present or prior tenant was lawful;\\n  (vi) the existence or terms and conditions of a preferential rent, or\\nthe propriety of a legal registered rent during a period when the\\ntenants were charged a preferential rent;\\n  (vii) the legality of a rent charged or registered immediately prior\\nto the registration of a preferential rent; or\\n  (viii) the amount of the legal regulated rent where the apartment was\\nvacant or temporarily exempt on the date six years prior to a tenant's\\ncomplaint.\\n  b. Within a city having a population of one million or more, the state\\ndivision of housing and community renewal shall have such powers to\\nenforce this act as shall be provided in the New York city rent\\nstabilization law of nineteen hundred sixty-nine, as amended, or as\\nshall otherwise be provided by law. Unless a tenant shall have filed a\\ncomplaint of overcharge with the division which complaint has not been\\nwithdrawn, nothing contained in this section shall be deemed to prevent\\na tenant or tenants, claiming to have been overcharged, from commencing\\nan action or interposing a counterclaim in a court of competent\\njurisdiction for damages equal to the overcharge and the penalty\\nprovided for in this section, including interest from the date of the\\novercharge at the rate of interest payable on a judgment pursuant to\\nsection five thousand four of the civil practice law and rules, plus the\\nstatutory costs and allowable disbursements in connection with the\\nproceeding. The courts and the division shall have concurrent\\njurisdiction, subject to the tenant's choice of forum.\\n  c. The state division of housing and community renewal may, by\\nregulation, provide for administrative review of all orders and\\ndeterminations issued by it pursuant to this act. Any such regulation\\nshall provide that if a petition for such review is not determined\\nwithin ninety days after it is filed, it shall be deemed to be denied.\\nHowever, the division may grant one extension not to exceed thirty days\\nwith the consent of the party filing such petition; any further\\nextension may only be granted with the consent of all parties to the\\npetition. No proceeding may be brought pursuant to article seventy-eight\\nof the civil practice law and rules to challange any order or\\ndetermination which is subject to such administrative review unless such\\nreview has been sought and either (1) a determination thereon has been\\nmade or (2) the ninety-day period provided for determination of the\\npetition for review (or any extension thereof) has expired.\\n",
