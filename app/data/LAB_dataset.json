The report must demonstrate that\\nthe applicant has satisfied all eligibility requirements and provided\\nall the information necessary for the commissioner to compute an actual\\namount of credit allowed for that calendar year, notwithstanding the\\nfact that a participating employer's taxable year may be a fiscal year,\\nas defined in subdivision ten of section two hundred eight of the tax\\nlaw.\\n  (4) After reviewing the final report and finding it sufficient, the\\ncommissioner shall certify the participating employer as a certified\\nemployer and issue a final certificate of tax credit. Such certificate\\nshall include, but not be limited to, the following information:\\n  (A) The name and employer identification number of the certified\\nemployer;\\n  (B) The actual amount of credit to which the certified employer is\\nentitled for that calendar year, which actual amount cannot exceed the\\namount of credit listed on the preliminary certificate but may be less\\nthan such amount;\\n  (C) The allocation year of the credit.\\n  (5) If a certified employer's taxable year is a fiscal year, it shall\\nbe entitled to claim the credit on the return for the fiscal year that\\nincludes the last day of the calendar year covered by the final\\ncertificate of tax credit.\\n  (e) The commissioner shall establish guidelines and criteria that\\nspecify requirements for qualified employers to participate in the\\nprogram including criteria for certifying qualified apprentices. Any\\nregulations that the commissioner determines are necessary and are\\nconsistent with the purpose of this article may be adopted on an\\nemergency basis notwithstanding any provisions to the contrary in the\\nstate administrative procedure act. The commissioner may give preference\\nto qualified employers that hire and train disadvantaged youth through\\nqualified apprenticeship agreements, and qualified employers that are\\nengaged in demand occupations or industries, or in regional growth\\nsectors, including those identified by the department, such as clean\\nenergy, health care, technology, including software engineering and web\\ndevelopment, advanced manufacturing and conservation. In addition, the\\ncommissioner may give preference to employers that employ apprentices in\\nnewly established apprenticeship programs. The commissioner also may\\ntake the following factors into consideration when evaluating whether to\\napprove an application in a year subsequent to the year in which a\\nqualified employer was determined to be a certified employer:\\n  (1) the length of the qualified apprenticeship agreement the employer\\nhas entered into;\\n  (2) how many apprentices have graduated from the apprenticeship\\nprogram to which the qualified apprentice employed by the employer\\nbelongs;\\n  (3) how many apprentices in the apprenticeship program the qualified\\nemployer has hired; and\\n  (4) any other factors the commissioner deems relevant.\\n  (f) The commissioner shall annually publish a report. Such report must\\ncontain the names and addresses of any certified employer issued a final\\ncertificate of eligibility under this section, the work location of each\\napprentice generating credit, the amount of empire state apprenticeship\\ntax credit allowed to the certified employer as specified on such final\\ncertificate of eligibility, and the number of each of the first year\\napprentices, second year apprentices, third year apprentices, fourth\\nyear apprentices, and fifth year apprentices, and how many of each of\\nthose types are considered disadvantaged youth.

However, this\\nsection shall not supersede any inconsistent provision of the education\\nlaw, as applied to any school building certified by the commissioner of\\neducation as being in compliance with such law, and the regulations\\npromulgated pursuant thereto, on the effective date of this section, or\\nas applied to any application for certification which is pending before\\nthe effective date of this section.\\n  3. Duties. a. Every employer shall: (1) furnish to each of its\\nemployees, employment and a place of employment which are free from\\nrecognized hazards that are causing or are likely to cause death or\\nserious physical harm to its employees and which will provide reasonable\\nand adequate protection to the lives, safety or health of its employees;\\nand (2) comply with the safety and health standards promulgated under\\nthis section. In applying this paragraph, fundamental distinctions\\nbetween private and public employment shall be recognized.\\n  b.

Safety and health standards. a. The commissioner shall by rule\\nadopt all safety and health standards promulgated under the United\\nStates Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (Public Law, 91-596)\\nwhich are in effect on the effective date of this section, in order to\\nprovide reasonable and adequate protection to the lives, safety and\\nhealth of public employees and shall promulgate and repeal such rules\\nand regulations as may be necessary to conform to the standards\\nestablished pursuant to such act or pursuant to paragraph b of this\\nsubdivision.\\n  b. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph a of this subdivision,\\nthe commissioner, in consultation with the state occupational safety and\\nhealth hazard abatement board, shall promulgate rules and regulations\\nrecommended to him by such board which establish standards whenever such\\nboard finds (i) that no federal standard exists for the particular\\ncondition being addressed and that such a standard is necessary for the\\nprotection of the public employees at risk, or (ii) a federal standard\\nexists, but conditions in public workplaces in this state require a\\ndifferent standard, and such state standard will be at least as\\neffective in providing safe and healthful places of employment as the\\nfederal standard.\\n  c. Except for an employer located in a city with a population of over\\none million, any employer who employs a firefighter determined to be at\\nrisk of entrapment at elevations pursuant to regulations promulgated by\\nthe commissioner, shall provide emergency escape systems for use by such\\nfirefighter. The commissioner shall by rule identify the codes,\\nstandards and recommended practices of the National Fire Protection\\nAssociation and other appropriate standards approved by the commissioner\\nas are appropriate to the nature of the risk to which the firefighter\\nshall be exposed and shall, at a minimum, include in such rule language\\nrequiring employers to (1) identify whether firefighters employed by\\nthem would be exposed to the hazard of entrapment at elevated surfaces;\\n(2) identify those firefighters who would be exposed to the hazard; and\\n(3) determine the appropriate emergency escape systems to address the\\nhazard. Such emergency escape systems shall be adequate to protect the\\nhealth and safety of the firefighter. The employer shall ensure that the\\nfirefighter is instructed in the proper use of the emergency escape\\nsystems. As used in this subdivision, the term \"entrapment at\\nelevations\" shall mean a situation where a fire or other emergency\\nconditions require a firefighter inside a structure to immediately exit\\nthe structure but where such conditions make the normal route of exit\\nunusable, thereby requiring the firefighter to exit the structure from\\nan opening that is not designed as an exit and is above the ground floor\\nor at an elevation above the surrounding terrain that would reasonably\\nbe expected to cause injury to a firefighter exiting by means of this\\nopening without any emergency escape systems. As used in this\\nsubdivision, the term \"emergency escape system\" shall mean safety ropes\\nand system components and any other system that (1) is compliant with\\nthe codes, standards and recommended practices of the National Fire\\nProtection Association or other appropriate standard identified by the\\ncommissioner through regulation, as a means of emergency self-rescue\\nfrom an above grade, immediately hazardous environment, (2) has been\\ncertified by a nationally recognized safety testing and certification\\norganization, and (3) the commissioner has recognized through\\nregulation.\\n  In order to ensure the adequacy of the emergency escape systems, the\\nemployer must routinely inspect and ensure that:\\n  (1) Existing emergency escape systems meet the codes, standards and\\nrecommended practices adopted by the commissioner.\\n  (2) Existing emergency escape systems still perform their function and\\nto identify any of their limitations such as but not limited to:\\n  (i) Checking the labels or stamps on the equipment; and\\n  (ii) Checking any documentation or equipment specifications; and\\n  (iii) Contacting the supplier or the approval agency;\\n  (3) Firefighters are informed of the limitations of emergency escape\\nsystems;\\n  (4) Firefighters are not allowed or required to use any emergency\\nescape systems beyond their limitations;\\n  (5) Existing and new emergency escape systems have no visible defects\\nthat limit their safe use;\\n  (6) Emergency escape systems are used, cleaned, maintained and stored\\naccording to manufacturer's instructions;\\n  (7) The firefighter is instructed in identifying to the employer any\\ndefects that the firefighter may find in emergency escape systems; and\\n  (8) Any identified defects are corrected or immediate action is taken\\nby the employer to eliminate the use of this equipment.\\n  d. Any person who may be adversely affected by a standard issued under\\nthis section may, within thirty days after the effective date of such\\nstandard, commence a proceeding for judicial review pursuant to article\\nseventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules.\\n  5. Inspections. a. Any employee or representative of employees who\\nbelieves that a violation of a safety or health standard exists, or that\\nan imminent danger exists, may request an inspection by giving notice to\\nthe commissioner of such violation or danger. Such notice and request\\nshall be in writing, shall set forth with reasonable particularity the\\ngrounds for the notice, shall be signed by such employee or\\nrepresentative of employees, and a copy shall be provided by the\\ncommissioner to the employer or the person in charge no later than the\\ntime of inspection, except that on the request of the person giving such\\nnotice, his name and the names of individual employees or\\nrepresentatives of employees shall be withheld. Such inspections shall\\nbe made forthwith.\\n  b. A representative of the employer and an authorized employee\\nrepresentative shall be given the opportunity to accompany the\\ncommissioner during an inspection for the purpose of aiding such\\ninspection. Where there is no authorized employee representative, the\\ncommissioner shall consult with a reasonable number of employees\\nconcerning matters of safety and health in the workplace.\\n  c. The authority of the commissioner to inspect a premises pursuant to\\nsuch an employee complaint shall not be limited to the alleged violation\\ncontained in such complaint. The commissioner may inspect any other area\\nof the premises in which he has reason to believe that a violation of\\nthis section exists.\\n  d. No employee who accompanies the commissioner on an inspection shall\\nsuffer any reduction in wages.\\n  e. The commissioner may, upon his own initiative, conduct an\\ninspection of any premises occupied by a public employer if he has\\nreason to believe that a violation of this section has occurred or if he\\nhas a general administrative plan for the enforcement of this section,\\nincluding general schedule inspections, which provide a rational\\nadministrative basis for such inspecting. Within ninety days of\\nenactment of this paragraph the commissioner shall publish the general\\nadministrative plan and shall adopt regulations on the conduct of\\ninspections in locker rooms and other areas involving the personal\\nproperty and privacy rights of public employees.\\n  f. Any information obtained by the commissioner under this section\\nshall be obtained with a minimum burden upon the employers.\\n  5-a. Notwithstanding any other provisions of law, when a request for\\nan inspection has been made in a situation where there is an allegation\\nof an imminent danger such that an employee would be subjecting himself\\nor herself to serious injury or death because of the hazardous condition\\nin the workplace, the inspection shall be given the highest priority by\\nthe department and shall be carried out immediately.\\n  6. Enforcement procedures. a. If the commissioner determines that an\\nemployer has violated a provision of this section, or a safety or health\\nstandard or regulation promulgated under this section, he or she shall\\nwith reasonable promptness issue to the employer an order to comply\\nwhich shall describe particularly the nature of the violation including\\na reference to the provision of this section, standard, regulation or\\norder alleged to have been violated, shall fix a reasonable time for\\ncompliance and may establish the penalty to be assessed for failure to\\ncorrect the violation by the time fixed for compliance. An employer who\\nfails to correct a non-serious violation by the time fixed for\\ncompliance may be assessed a civil penalty of up to fifty dollars per\\nday until the violation is corrected. An employer who fails to correct a\\nserious violation by the time fixed for compliance may be assessed a\\ncivil penalty of up to two hundred dollars per day until the violation\\nis corrected. Pursuant to section 18(k) of the United States\\nOccupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (Public Law, 91-596), a\\nserious violation shall be deemed to exist in a place of employment if\\nthere is a substantial probability that death or serious physical harm\\ncould result from a condition which exists, or from one or more\\npractices, means, methods, operations, or processes which have been\\nadopted or are in use, in such place of employment unless the employer\\ndid not, and could not with the exercise of reasonable diligence, know\\nof the presence of the violation. A non-serious violation shall be\\ndefined as any violation that does not fall under the definition of\\nserious violation. The commissioner shall not assess a penalty against\\nan employer for failure to correct a violation of a standard which is\\nthe subject of an application for a temporary order granting a variance\\nor a violation which is the subject of a petition to modify an order to\\ncomply, provided however, that upon issuance by the commissioner of a\\ndetermination denying such variance or petition to modify, or upon\\nexpiration of a temporary variance or modified compliance period, the\\ntime fixed for compliance shall recommence and the employer become\\nliable for the penalties provided herein.\\n  b. Where the commissioner issues to an employer an order to comply,\\nthe employer shall post such order or a copy thereof in a conspicuous\\nplace at or near each place of violation cited in the order, where it is\\nclearly visible to affected employees. The commissioner shall make such\\norder available to employee representatives.\\n  c. Any employer, or other party affected by a determination of the\\nindustrial commissioner issued pursuant to this section may petition the\\nindustrial board of appeals for review of such determination in\\naccordance with section one hundred one of this chapter. Judicial review\\nof the decision of the industrial board of appeals may be obtained by\\nany party affected by such decision by commencing a proceeding pursuant\\nto article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules within\\nsixty days after such decision is issued.\\n  d. If the time for compliance with an order of the commissioner issued\\npursuant to this section has elapsed, and the employer has not complied\\nwith the provisions of the order, the commissioner shall seek judicial\\nenforcement of such order by commencing a proceeding pursuant to article\\nseventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules. Where an employer has\\ncomplied with an order in all respects other than the payment of a\\npenalty imposed pursuant to this subdivision, the commissioner may file\\nwith the county clerk of the county where the employer has its place of\\nbusiness the order of the commissioner continuing the amount of civil\\npenalty found to be due. The filing of such order shall have the full\\nforce and effect of a judgment duly docketed in the office of such\\nclerk. The order or decision may be enforced by and in the same manner,\\nand with like effect, as that prescribed by the civil practice law and\\nrules for the enforcement of a money judgment.\\n  7. Injunction proceedings. a. The supreme court of the state shall\\nhave jurisdiction, upon petition of the industrial commissioner,\\npursuant to the civil practice law and rules to restrain any conditions\\nor practices in any place of public employment which are such that a\\ndanger exists which could reasonably be expected to cause death or\\nserious physical harm immediately or before the imminence of such danger\\ncan be eliminated through the abatement procedures otherwise provided\\nfor by this section. Such proceeding shall be brought in the county in\\nwhich the violation is alleged to exist. Any order issued under this\\nsection may require such steps to be taken as may be necessary to avoid,\\ncorrect or remove such imminent danger and prohibit the employment or\\npresence of any individual in locations or under conditions where such\\nimminent danger exists, except individuals whose presence is necessary\\nto avoid, correct, or remove such imminent danger or to maintain the\\ncapacity of a continuous process operation to resume normal operations\\nwithout a complete cessation of operations, or where a cessation of\\noperations is necessary, to permit such to be accomplished in a safe and\\norderly manner. The employer may contest such order pursuant to the\\ncivil practice law and rules.\\n  b. Whenever and as soon as an inspector concludes that conditions or\\npractices described in paragraph a of this subdivision exist in any\\nplace of public employment, he shall inform the affected employees and\\nemployers of the danger and that he is recommending to the industrial\\ncommissioner that relief be sought.\\n  c. If the industrial commissioner fails to seek relief under this\\nsection within forty-eight hours of being notified of such condition,\\nany employee who may be injured by reason of such failure, or the\\nauthorized employee representative of such employees, may seek\\ninjunctive relief as provided in paragraph a of this subdivision.\\n  8. Variances. a. Any employer may apply to the commissioner for a\\ntemporary order granting a variance from a standard or any provision\\nthereof promulgated under this section. Such temporary order shall be\\ngranted only if the employer files an application which meets the\\nrequirements of paragraph b of this subdivision and establishes that (1)\\nhe is unable to comply with a standard by its effective date because of\\nunavailability of professional or technical personnel or of materials\\nand equipment needed to come into compliance with the standard or\\nbecause necessary construction or alteration of facilities cannot be\\ncompleted by the effective date, (2) he is taking all available steps to\\nsafeguard employees against the hazards covered by the standard, and (3)\\nhe has an effective program for coming into compliance with the standard\\nas quickly as practicable. Any temporary order issued under this\\nsubdivision shall prescribe the practices, means, methods, operations\\nand processes which the employer must adopt and use while the order is\\nin effect and state in detail his program for coming into compliance\\nwith the standard. Such a temporary order may be granted only after\\nnotice to employees and an opportunity for a hearing, provided the\\ncommissioner may issue one interim order to be effective until a\\ndecision is made on the basis of the hearing. No temporary order may be\\nin effect for longer than the period needed by the employer to achieve\\ncompliance with the standard or one year, whichever is shorter, except\\nthat such an order may be renewed not more than twice so long as the\\nrequirements of this subdivision are met and if an application for\\nrenewal is filed at least ninety days prior to the expiration date of\\nthe order. No interim renewal of an order may remain in effect longer\\nthan one hundred and eighty days.\\n  b. An application for a temporary variance order shall contain: (1) a\\nspecification of the standard or portion thereof from which the employer\\nor owner seeks a variance; (2) a representation by the employer,\\nsupported by representations from qualified persons who have firsthand\\nknowledge of the facts represented, that he is unable to comply with the\\nstandard or portion thereof and a detailed statement of the reasons\\ntherefor; (3) a statement of the steps he has taken and will take, with\\nspecific dates, to protect employees against the hazard covered by the\\nstandard; (4) a statement of when he expects to be able to comply with\\nthe standard and what steps he has taken and what steps he will take,\\nwith dates specified, to come into compliance with the standard; and (5)\\na certification that he has informed his employees of the application by\\ngiving a copy thereof to their authorized representative, posting a\\nstatement giving a summary of the application and specifying where a\\ncopy may be examined at the place or places where notices to employees\\nare normally posted, and by other appropriate means. A description of\\nhow employees have been informed shall be contained in the\\ncertification. The information to employees shall also inform them of\\ntheir right to petition the commissioner for a hearing. The commissioner\\nis also authorized to grant a variance from any standard or portion\\nthereof whenever he determines that such variance is necessary to permit\\nan employer to participate in an experiment approved by him designed to\\ndemonstrate or validate new and improved techniques to safeguard the\\nhealth or safety of workers.\\n  c. Any affected employer may apply to the commissioner for a rule or\\norder for a variance from a standard promulgated under this section.\\nAffected employees shall be given notice of each such application and an\\nopportunity to participate in a hearing. The commissioner shall issue\\nsuch rule or order if he determines on the record, after opportunity for\\nan inspection where appropriate and a hearing, that the proponent of the\\nvariance has demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence that the\\nconditions, practices, means, methods, operations or processes used or\\nproposed to be used by an employer will provide employment and places of\\nemployment which are as safe and healthful as those which would prevail\\nif he complied with the standard. The rule or order so issued shall\\nprescribe the conditions the employer must maintain, and the practices,\\nmeans, methods, operations and processes which he must adopt and utilize\\nto the extent they differ from the standard in question. Such a rule or\\norder may be modified or revoked upon application by an employer, any\\nemployee or employee representative, or by the commissioner on his own\\nmotion, in the manner prescribed for its issuance under this subdivision\\nat any time after six months from its issuance.\\n  d. Any person, who may be adversely affected by a rule or order issued\\nunder this subdivision may challenge the validity or applicability of\\nsuch rule or order by commencing, within sixty days, a proceeding\\npursuant to article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules.\\n  9. Recordkeeping. a.

If the commissioner finds that an employer\\nhas violated any provision of this article or of a rule or regulation\\npromulgated thereunder, the commissioner may by an order which shall\\ndescribe particularly the nature of the violation, assess the employer a\\ncivil penalty of not more than one thousand dollars for the first such\\nviolation, not more than two thousand dollars for a second violation and\\nnot more than three thousand dollars for a third or subsequent\\nviolation. Such penalty shall be paid to the commissioner for deposit in\\nthe treasury of the state. In assessing the amount of the penalty, the\\ncommissioner shall give due consideration to the size of the employer's\\nbusiness, the good faith of the employer, the gravity of the violation,\\nthe history of previous violations and the failure to comply with\\nrecord-keeping or other requirements, provided, however, that where such\\nviolation involves illegal employment during which a minor is seriously\\ninjured or dies, such penalty shall be treble the maximum penalty\\nallowable under the law for such violation.  For the purposes of this\\nsubdivision, a minor shall be deemed to be seriously injured if such\\ninjury results in a permanent partial or permanent total disability as\\ndetermined by the workers' compensation board.\\n  2. Any order issued under subdivision one of this section shall be\\ndeemed a final order of the commissioner and not subject to review by\\nany court or agency unless the employer files a petition with the\\nindustrial board of appeals for a review of the order, pursuant to\\nsection one hundred one of this chapter.\\n  3. Provided that no proceeding for administrative or judicial review\\nas provided in this chapter shall then be pending and the time for\\ninitiation of such proceeding shall have expired, the commissioner may\\nfile with the county clerk of the county where the employer resides or\\nhas a place of business the order of the commissioner or the decision of\\nthe industrial board of appeals containing the amount of the civil\\npenalty. The filing of such order or decision shall have the full force\\nand effect of a judgment duly docketed in the office of such clerk. The\\norder or decision may be enforced by and in the name of the commissioner\\nin the same manner, and with like effect, as that prescribed by the\\ncivil practice law and rules for the enforcement of a money judgment.\\n  4. The civil penalty provided for in this section shall be in addition\\nto and may be imposed concurrently with any other remedy or penalty\\nprovided for in this chapter.\\n",

THE CHILD'S\\nPARENTS OR GUARDIAN MUST PROVIDE THE CHILD PERFORMER'S EMPLOYER WITH THE\\nINFORMATION NECESSARY TO TRANSFER THESE MONIES TO THE ACCOUNT. FAILURE\\nTO COMPLY WITH THIS REQUIREMENT WILL PREVENT THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR\\nFROM RENEWING THE CHILD'S PERMIT TO WORK AS A CHILD PERFORMER.\"\\n  (e) No permit shall allow a child to participate in an exhibition,\\nrehearsal or performance which is harmful to the welfare, development or\\nproper education of such child. A permit may be revoked by the\\ndepartment for good cause.\\n  2.

Each application for initial registration shall be\\naccompanied by a fee determined by the commissioner in an amount\\nsufficient in the aggregate to defray the department's costs of\\nadministering the registration program, provided, that such fee shall\\nnot exceed three hundred fifty dollars for initial registration or two\\nhundred dollars for registration renewal. Companies that operate\\ntheaters of four hundred ninety-nine seats or fewer shall pay no more\\nthan two hundred dollars for an initial and renewal certificates.

Failure to produce any permit or certificate either to work or to\\nemploy is prima facie evidence of the illegal employment of any child\\nperformer whose permit or certificate is not produced.

Manual worker.--- (i) A manual worker shall be paid weekly and not\\nlater than seven calendar days after the end of the week in which the\\nwages are earned; provided however that a manual worker employed by an\\nemployer authorized by the commissioner pursuant to subparagraph (ii) of\\nthis paragraph or by a non-profitmaking organization shall be paid in\\naccordance with the agreed terms of employment, but not less frequently\\nthan semi-monthly.\\n  (ii) The commissioner may authorize an employer which has in the three\\nyears preceding the application employed an average of one thousand or\\nmore persons in this state or has for one year preceding the application\\nemployed an average of one thousand or more persons in this state and\\nhas for three years preceding the application employed an average of\\nthree thousand or more persons outside the state to pay less frequently\\nthan weekly but not less frequently than semi-monthly if the employer\\nfurnishes satisfactory proof to the commissioner of its continuing\\nability to meet its payroll responsibilities. In making this\\ndetermination the commissioner shall consider the following: (A) the\\nemployer's history meeting its payroll responsibilities in New York\\nstate or if no such history in New York state is available, other\\nfinancial information, as requested by the commissioner, which will\\nassist the commissioner in determining the likelihood of the employer's\\ncontinuing ability to meet payroll responsibilities; (B) proof of the\\nemployer's coverage for workers' compensation and disability; (C) proof\\nthat there are no outstanding warrants of the department of taxation and\\nfinance or the department of labor against the employer for failure to\\nremit state personal income tax withholdings or unemployment insurance\\ncontributions; and (D) proof that the employer has a computerized record\\nkeeping system for payroll which, at a minimum, specifies hours worked,\\nrate of pay, gross wages, deductions and date of pay for each employee.\\nIf the employers' manual workers are represented by a labor\\norganization, the commissioner shall not grant an employer's application\\nfor authorization under this subparagraph unless that labor organization\\nconsents thereto.\\n  Upon notice to the employer and an opportunity to be heard, the\\ncommissioner may rescind such authorization whenever the commissioner\\nhas determined, based upon the factors enumerated above, that the\\nemployer is no longer able to meet its payroll responsibilities as\\npreviously authorized.\\n  b. Railroad worker.--- A railroad worker shall be paid on or before\\nThursday of each week the wages earned during the seven-day period\\nending on Tuesday of the preceding week; and provided further that at\\nthe written request and notification of address by any employee, every\\nrailroad corporation, with the exception of those commuter railroads\\nunder the jurisdiction of the metropolitan transportation authority,\\nshall mail every check for wages of such employee via the United States\\npostal service, first class mail.\\n  c.

The employer shall furnish a\\ncommission salesperson, upon written request, a statement of earnings\\npaid or due and unpaid. The agreed terms of employment shall be reduced\\nto writing, signed by both the employer and the commission salesperson,\\nkept on file by the employer for a period not less than three years and\\nmade available to the commissioner upon request. Such writing shall\\ninclude a description of how wages, salary, drawing account, commissions\\nand all other monies earned and payable shall be calculated. Where the\\nwriting provides for a recoverable draw, the frequency of reconciliation\\nshall be included. Such writing shall also provide details pertinent to\\npayment of wages, salary, drawing account, commissions and all other\\nmonies earned and payable in the case of termination of employment by\\neither party. The failure of an employer to produce such written terms\\nof employment, upon request of the commissioner, shall give rise to a\\npresumption that the terms of employment that the commissioned\\nsalesperson has presented are the agreed terms of employment.\\n  d. Clerical and other worker.--- A clerical and other worker shall be\\npaid the wages earned in accordance with the agreed terms of employment,\\nbut not less frequently than semi-monthly, on regular pay days\\ndesignated in advance by the employer.\\n  2.

Such\\nfactor: (A) shall not be based upon or derived from a differential in\\ncompensation based on status within one or more protected class or\\nclasses and (B) shall be job-related with respect to the position in\\nquestion and shall be consistent with business necessity. Such exception\\nunder this paragraph shall not apply when the employee demonstrates (1)\\nthat an employer uses a particular employment practice that causes a\\ndisparate impact on the basis of status within one or more protected\\nclass or classes, (2) that an alternative employment practice exists\\nthat would serve the same business purpose and not produce such\\ndifferential, and (3) that the employer has refused to adopt such\\nalternative practice.\\n  2.

He or she may take assignments of claims for wages under this\\nchapter from employees or third parties in trust for such employees or\\nfor the benefit of various funds for such employees. All such\\nassignments shall run to the commissioner and his or her successor in\\noffice.

Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no monies appropriated\\nby the state for any purpose shall be used or made available to\\nemployers to: (a) train managers, supervisors or other administrative\\npersonnel regarding methods to encourage or discourage union\\norganization, or to encourage or discourage an employee from\\nparticipating in a union organizing drive; (b) hire or pay attorneys,\\nconsultants or other contractors to encourage or discourage union\\norganization, or to encourage or discourage an employee from\\nparticipating in a union organizing drive; or (c) hire employees or pay\\nthe salary and other compensation of employees whose principal job\\nduties are to encourage or discourage union organization, or to\\nencourage or discourage an employee from participating in a union\\norganizing drive.\\n  3. Any employer that utilizes funds appropriated by the state and\\nengages in such activities shall maintain, for a period of not less than\\nthree years from the date of such activities, financial records, audited\\nas to their validity and accuracy, sufficient to show that state funds\\nwere not used to pay for such activities. An employer shall make such\\nfinancial records available to the state entity that provided such funds\\nand the attorney general within ten business days of receipt of a\\nrequest from such entity or the attorney general for such records.\\n  4. The attorney general may apply in the name of the people of the\\nstate of New York for an order enjoining or restraining the commission\\nor continuance of the alleged violation of this section. In any such\\nproceeding, the court may order the return to the state of the\\nunlawfully expended funds. Further, the court may impose a civil penalty\\nnot to exceed one thousand dollars where it has been shown that an\\nemployer engaged in a violation of subdivision two of this section;\\nprovided, however, that a court may impose a civil penalty not to exceed\\none thousand dollars or three times the amount of money unlawfully\\nexpended, whichever is greater, where it is shown that the employer\\nknowingly engaged in a violation of subdivision two of this section or\\nwhere the employer previously had been found to have violated\\nsubdivision two within the preceding two years. All monies collected\\npursuant to this section shall be deposited in the state general fund.\\n  5. The commissioner shall promulgate regulations describing the form\\nand content of the financial records required pursuant to this section,\\nand the commissioner shall provide advice and guidance to state entities\\nsubject to the provisions of this section as to the implementation of\\ncontractual and administrative measures to enforce the purposes of this\\nsection.\\n",

As used in this section:\\n  (a) \"Policyholder\" shall mean any person, co-partnership, corporation,\\ntrade association, joint stock association, incorporated or\\nunincorporated association, trustees or labor organization as defined in\\nsubsections (c) and (g), respectively, of section four thousand four\\nhundred two of the insurance law or any other entity to whom a policy or\\ncontract of group accident, group health or group accident and health\\ninsurance has been issued.\\n  For the purpose of this section, \"policyholder\" shall also include any\\ngroup remitting agent.\\n  (b) \"Certificate holder\" shall mean any person insured, on either a\\ncontributory or non-contributory basis, by a policy or contract of group\\naccident, group health or group accident and health insurance, as well\\nas persons covered by group remittance policies.\\n  3. Notification. A policyholder shall, subsequent to receipt from the\\ninsurer of notice of termination pursuant to subsection (k) of section\\nfour thousand two hundred thirty-five of the insurance law provide\\nwritten notice to the certificate holders of such policy of such\\ntermination. In any case where the policyholder is substituting such\\npolicy with another policy providing similar coverage for the same\\ncertificate holders, the policyholder shall provide certificate holders\\nwith a written notice including therein the name of the substituted\\ninsurer. Where the employees are represented by a labor organization,\\nsuch notice shall be given to the representative of that labor\\norganization. Such written notice shall be in accordance with the rules\\nand regulations of the superintendent of financial services, promulgated\\npursuant to subsection (l) of section four thousand two hundred\\nthirty-five of the insurance law.\\n  4. Exception. The provisions of subdivision three of this section\\nshall not be deemed to apply if, within ten days subsequent to receipt\\nof notice of termination from the insurer, the policyholder has taken\\nnecessary steps whereby the intended termination is rendered null and\\nvoid.\\n  5. Where the policyholder has contracted with another insurer to\\nreplace the existing insurer for the providing of similar and continuous\\ncoverage for the same certificate holders he shall file an affidavit\\nwith the commissioner of labor and superintendent of financial services\\nto that effect.\\n  6. Remittance of premiums. Any policyholder who receives notification\\nfrom an individual entitled to exercise a right to continuation of\\ncoverage by the policyholder's insurer pursuant to section three\\nthousand two hundred twenty-one of the insurance law, shall, no later\\nthan thirty days subsequent to receipt of premiums from such individual,\\nremit such premiums to the insurer on behalf of such individual and\\nprovide evidence to the individual that the premium has been remitted.\\n  6-a. Residence location to accompany enrollment data.

Penalties. (a) Any policyholder who fails to comply with this\\nsection, shall forfeit to the people of the State a sum up to five\\nthousand dollars, to be recovered by the commissioner in a civil action.\\nWhere the policyholder is a corporation, trade association, joint stock\\nassociation, incorporated or unincorporated association, the president,\\nsecretary and treasurer thereof shall be liable for any forfeiture.\\n  (b) In addition to such penalty, where the failure to comply involves\\nthe failure to notify an employee of the termination of a group accident\\nor group health policy pursuant to subdivision three of this section or\\nthe failure to remit premiums pursuant to subdivision six of this\\nsection, or the failure to provide an individual with notice of\\ntermination pursuant to subdivision six of section one hundred\\nninety-five of this chapter, the policy holder shall also be liable, in\\na civil action brought by the individual entitled to receive the notice\\nof termination or exercise the right to continuation of coverage in a\\ncourt of competent jurisdiction, to appropriate damages which shall\\ninclude reimbursement for medical expenses which were not covered by the\\npolicyholder's insurer by virtue of his termination of the policy or\\nfailure to remit such premiums.\\n",

If the financial officer of the civil division interested fails to\\npay to the claimant the amount of the claim as determined by the fiscal\\nofficer within ten days after the expiration of the contractor's time to\\ncommence a proceeding for review of the fiscal officer's order or, if\\nsuch a proceeding has been commenced, within ten days after entry and\\nservice of a court order confirming the fiscal officer's order, the\\ncivil division interested shall pay to the claimant interest on the\\nclaim at the rate of interest then in effect as prescribed by the\\nsuperintendent of financial services pursuant to section fourteen-a of\\nthe banking law from the date the financial officer was required to pay\\nthe claim as provided herein to the date of payment; provided, however,\\nthis paragraph shall not apply if the failure of the financial officer\\nof the civil division interested to pay the amount of the claim is\\npursuant to court order.\\n  g. When a final determination has been made in favor of a complainant\\nand the contractor or subcontractor found violating this article has\\nfailed to make payment as required by the order of the fiscal officer,\\nand provided that no relevant proceeding for judicial review shall then\\nbe pending and the time for initiation of such proceeding shall have\\nexpired, the fiscal officer may file a copy of the order of the fiscal\\nofficer containing the amount found to be due with the county clerk of\\nthe county of residence or place of business of any of the following:\\n  (i) any substantially-owned affiliated entity or any successor of the\\ncontractor or subcontractor;\\n  (ii) any of the partners if the contractor or subcontractor is a\\npartnership or any of the five largest shareholders of the contractor or\\nsubcontractor, as determined by the fiscal officer; or\\n  (iii) any officer of the contractor or subcontractor who knowingly\\nparticipated in the violation of this article; provided, however, that\\nthe fiscal officer shall within five days of the filing of the order\\nprovide notice thereof to the partner or top five shareholders or\\nsuccessor or substantially-owned affiliated entity or other entity\\ndetermined to have violated any provision of subdivision five of section\\ntwo hundred twenty of this article or this subdivision; the notified\\nparty may contest the filing on the basis that it is not a partner or\\ntop five shareholder, any officer of the contractor or subcontractor who\\nknowingly participated in the violation of this article, or successor or\\nsubstantially-owned affiliated entity. If, after reviewing the\\ninformation provided by the notified party in support of such contest,\\nthe fiscal officer determines that the notified party is not subject to\\nthe provision of this paragraph, the fiscal officer shall immediately\\nwithdraw his filing of the order.\\n  The filing of such order shall have the full force and effect of a\\njudgment duly docketed in the office of such clerk. The order may be\\nenforced by and in the name of the fiscal officer in the same manner,\\nand with like effect, as that prescribed by the civil practice law and\\nrules for the enforcement of a money judgment.\\n  h.

The employment of women\\nand minors in industry in the state of New York under conditions\\nresulting in wages unreasonably low and conditions injurious to their\\nhealth and general welfare is a matter of grave and vital public\\nconcern.  Any conditions of employment especially fostering such working\\nconditions are therefore destructive of purposes already accepted as\\nsound public policy by the legislature of the state and should be\\nbrought into conformity with that policy.  Uncontrolled continuance of\\nhomework is such a condition; here wages are notoriously lower and\\nworking conditions endanger the health of the worker; the protection of\\nfactory industries, which must operate in competition therewith and of\\nthe women and minors employed therein and of the public interest of the\\ncommunity at large in their health and well-being, require strict\\ncontrol and gradual elimination of industrial homework. In the\\nconsidered judgment of the legislature this article is constitutional.\\n  2. Whenever used in this article: a. \"Manufacture,\" \"manufacturing,\"\\n\"manufactured\" or \"making\" includes preparation, alteration, repair or\\nfinishing, in whole or in part, or handling in any way.\\n  b. \"Employer\" means any person who either directly or through an\\nemployee, agent, independent contractor, or any other person, delivers\\nor causes to be delivered to another person, any materials to be\\nmanufactured in a home, and which are thereafter to be returned to him,\\nnot for the personal use of himself or of a member of his family, or to\\nbe delivered, mailed, or shipped to others.\\n  c. \"Home\" means a room or an apartment in any house.\\n  d. \"House\" means any building in which one or more persons regularly\\nsleep, and shall include outbuildings upon premises which include such\\nbuilding; but where only a person or persons or the family of a person\\nor persons engaged in the service of the building, sleep in such\\nbuilding, the term \"house\" shall apply only to the separate room or\\nrooms or to the apartment or apartments in which one or more of such\\npersons sleep.\\n  e. \"Industrial homework\" means the manufacturing in a home, in whole\\nor in part, with or of material which has been furnished by an employer,\\nof any article or articles to be returned to the said employer, or to be\\ndelivered, mailed, or shipped to others.\\n  f. \"Industrial homeworker\" means any person who manufactures in a\\nhome, in whole or in part, with or out of material furnished by an\\nemployer for industrial homework, any article or articles to be returned\\nto such employer directly or indirectly, or to be delivered, mailed or\\nshipped to others.\\n  g. \"Person\" includes a corporation, a copartnership or a joint stock\\nassociation.\\n  h. \"Homework contractor or distributor\" means any person who for the\\naccount or benefit of an employer delivers to a homeworker or any other\\nperson not engaged by such employer articles or materials to be\\nmanufactured in a home and thereafter to be returned to said person or\\notherwise disposed of in accordance with his direction.\\n",

As a guide to the interpretation and\\napplication of this article, the public policy of this state is declared\\nto be as follows: Economic insecurity due to unemployment is a serious\\nmenace to the health, welfare, and morale of the people of this state.\\nInvoluntary unemployment is therefore a subject of general interest and\\nconcern which requires appropriate action by the legislature to prevent\\nits spread and to lighten its burden, which now so often falls with\\ncrushing force upon the unemployed worker and his family. After\\nsearching examination of the effects of widespread unemployment within\\nthe state, the joint legislative committee on unemployment appointed\\npursuant to a joint resolution adopted April ninth, nineteen hundred\\nthirty-one, reported to the legislature that \"the problem of\\nunemployment can better be met by the so-called compulsory unemployment\\ninsurance plan than it is now handled by the barren actualities of poor\\nrelief assistance backed by compulsory contribution through taxation.\\nOnce the facts are apprehended this conclusion is precipitated with the\\ncertainty of a chemical reaction. \" Taking into account the report of\\nits own committee, together with facts tending to support it which are\\nmatters of common knowledge, the legislature therefore declares that in\\nits considered judgment the public good and the well-being of the wage\\nearners of this state require the enactment of this measure for the\\ncompulsory setting aside of financial reserves for the benefit of\\npersons unemployed through no fault of their own.\\n",

                  "text" : "  § 502. Wage reporting - findings and policy. The legislature hereby\\nfinds and declares that New York state is committed to developing the\\nmost efficient and effective system possible for administering the\\nunemployment insurance system which, for more than a half century, has\\nprovided financial support to workers who have lost their jobs through\\nno fault of their own.\\n  Unlike all other states and territories, which administer their\\nunemployment insurance systems pursuant to a wage reporting system\\nwhereby employers report employee wages on a regular basis, New York\\nmaintains a wage request system. In order to acquire the enormous amount\\nof wage data necessary to calculate unemployment insurance benefits\\nusing such a system, the department is required to send out hundreds of\\nthousands of wage requests to employers every year. These requests are\\nfor information which, in large part, is submitted by employers on a\\nquarterly basis to the statewide wage reporting system administered by\\nthe department of taxation and finance.\\n  Given the size and complexity of the unemployment insurance system, an\\nincrease in efficiency will necessarily result in significant\\nimprovements in the services provided to benefit claimants and\\nemployers. The improvements for benefit claimants that would result from\\nthe implementation of a wage reporting system include more timely and\\naccurate entitlement and benefit rate determinations, a reduction in the\\nneed to rely upon a claimant's own tax and wage statements and a\\ndecrease in claimant overpayments which must be recovered at a later\\ndate. As for employers, they would, for the large majority of benefit\\nclaims filed, no longer be required to provide employee wage data upon\\nrequest, which would remove a significant employer burden as well as the\\npotential for a fifty dollar penalty each time a wage request is not\\nanswered in a timely manner. Wage reporting would also reduce the number\\nof employers incorrectly charged for benefits.\\n  Furthermore, the department is accountable under federal and state law\\nto measure the success of training, employment and reemployment\\ninitiatives operated pursuant to such laws. The assessment of individual\\nperformance is the best way to measure program quality and to develop\\nprogram improvements. Job placement, employment duration and earnings\\nare basic outcomes used to measure such performance. Information\\nsurveys, traditionally used to collect such data, have proved to be both\\nexpensive and unreliable because of low response rates and faulty recall\\nby those who respond. Using the statewide wage reporting system to track\\nsuch performance outcomes will avoid these problems and produce a\\nreliable system of accountability while placing no additional burdens on\\nemployers.\\n  Accordingly, for the above reasons, section one hundred seventy-one-a\\nof the tax law is amended to provide the department with complete access\\nto the wage reporting files maintained by the department of taxation and\\nfinance as the first stage in a transition to an unemployment insurance\\nsystem based upon such wage reporting files, with the express\\nrequirement that the department shall design and operate such system so\\nthat an individual eligible for benefits under the current law would be\\neligible for the same amount of benefits under a new system based upon\\nthe wage reporting files. In addition, complete access to the wage\\nreporting files is granted for administration of the department's\\nemployment security programs as well as for evaluation of the effect on\\nearnings of participation in training programs with respect to which the\\ndepartment has reporting, monitoring or evaluating responsibilities.\\n",

Each employer liable under\\nthis article shall pay contributions on all wages paid by him at the\\nrate of five and four-tenths per centum or, if applicable to the\\nemployer, at the rate provided by the provisions of sections five\\nhundred seventy-seven and five hundred eighty-one. However, if\\ncontributions so established exceed five and four-tenths per centum of\\nwages paid by him which are subject to the federal unemployment tax act,\\nthey shall be reduced by that part of such excess, if any, which is\\ncaused by the provisions of paragraph (b) of subdivision one of section\\nfive hundred eighteen.\\n  2. Time and method of payment. Contributions shall become payable by\\nany employer for wages paid on and after the date on which he becomes\\nliable under this article. All contributions from employers shall be\\npaid at such times and in such manner as the commissioner may prescribe.\\n  3. Default. An employer who fails to pay contributions required to be\\nmade by him to the fund shall pay interest at the rate of one per centum\\nof the amount of such contributions for each month he is in default.\\nSuch interest shall be assessed, collected and paid as part of the\\npayment required to be made by the employer to the fund.\\n  4. Fraud. If any part of any deficiency is due to fraud with intent to\\navoid payment of contributions to the fund, fifty per centum of the\\ntotal amount of the deficiency, in addition to such deficiency, shall be\\nassessed, collected, and paid in the same manner as if it were a\\ndeficiency.\\n  5. Refunds and credits. If an employer shall make application for a\\nrefund of any contribution, interest, or penalty paid by him or for a\\ncredit thereof and the commissioner shall determine that such\\ncontribution, interest or penalty, or any portion thereof was\\nerroneously collected, the commissioner shall refund said amount or\\nallow a credit therefor. If said refund was created as a result of\\ndepartmental error then the commissioner shall pay said refund with\\ninterest paid at the rate of three-fourths of one per centum of the\\namount of such contribution, interest and penalty for each month between\\nthe time of the erroneous collection and thirty days previous to the\\ndate of the refund check, as specified in this subdivision, unless the\\nemployer shall have already deducted said amount by way of credit\\nagainst moneys payable by him into the fund.

Any\\ncredit or refund of interest and penalties erroneously collected, any\\ninterest on such credit or refund, and any interest on contributions,\\ninterest and penalties erroneously collected, allowed by the\\ncommissioner under the foregoing conditions, shall be a charge against\\nthe special fund. Any credit or refund of contributions erroneously\\ncollected, allowed by the commissioner under the foregoing conditions,\\nshall be a charge against the unemployment insurance fund.\\n  Nothing contained in this subdivision shall require or permit the\\nrefund or credit of any contributions due and payable under article\\neighteen of this chapter as in effect at the time such contributions\\nwere paid.\\n  6. Agreement to contributions by employees void. No agreement by an\\nemployee to pay any portion of the payment made by his employer for the\\npurpose of providing benefits required by this article shall be valid\\nand no employer shall make a deduction for such purpose from the\\nremuneration of any employee.\\n  7.

Such excess\\ncontributions shall be irrevocable and not subject to refund or credit\\nafter acceptance by the commissioner and deposit in the fund.\\n  (e) \"Experience rating charge\" means a debit to an employer's account\\nreflecting a payment of benefits.\\n  (1)  Whenever benefits are paid to a claimant, experience rating\\ncharges shall be debited to the appropriate account.  The commissioner\\nshall notify each employer not more frequently than monthly as to each\\nexperience rating charge which is being made to  the employer's account.\\nSuch notice shall be a determination of the propriety of such charge and\\nof the payment of benefits on which such charge was based.\\n  (2) Benefits payable to any claimant with respect to the claimant's\\nthen current benefit year shall be charged, when paid, to the account of\\nthe last employer prior to the filing of a valid original claim in an\\namount equal to seven times the claimant's benefit rate. Thereafter,\\nsuch charges shall be made to the account of each employer in the base\\nperiod used to establish the valid original claim in the same proportion\\nthat the remuneration paid by each employer to the claimant during that\\nbase period bears to the remuneration paid by all employers to the\\nclaimant during that base period except as provided below:\\n  (i) In those instances where the claimant may not utilize wages paid\\nto establish entitlement based upon subdivision ten of section five\\nhundred ninety of this article and an educational institution is the\\nclaimant's last employer prior to the filing of the claim for benefits,\\nor the claimant performed services in such educational institution in\\nsuch capacity while employed by an educational service agency which is\\nthe claimant's last employer prior to the filing of the claim for\\nbenefits, such employer shall not be liable for benefit charges for the\\nfirst twenty-eight effective days of benefits paid as otherwise provided\\nby this section. Under such circumstances, benefits paid shall be\\ncharged to the general account. In addition, wages paid during the base\\nperiod by such educational institutions, or for services in such\\neducational institutions for claimants employed by an educational\\nservice agency shall not be considered base period wages during periods\\nthat such wages may not be used to gain entitlement to benefits pursuant\\nto subdivision ten of section five hundred ninety of this article.\\n  (ii) In those instances where the claimant may not utilize wages paid\\nto establish entitlement based upon subdivision eleven of section five\\nhundred ninety of this article and an educational institution is the\\nclaimant's last employer prior to the filing of the claim for benefits,\\nor the claimant performed services in such educational institution in\\nsuch capacity while employed by an educational service agency which is\\nthe claimant's last employer prior to the filing of the claim for\\nbenefits, such employer shall not be liable for benefit charges for the\\nfirst twenty-eight effective days of benefits paid as otherwise provided\\nby this section. Under such circumstances, benefits paid will be charged\\nto the general account. In addition, wages paid during the base period\\nby such educational institutions, or for services in such educational\\ninstitutions for claimants employed by an educational service agency\\nshall not be considered base period wages during periods that such wages\\nmay not be used to gain entitlement to benefits pursuant to subdivision\\neleven of section five hundred ninety of this article. However, in those\\ninstances where a claimant was not afforded an opportunity to perform\\nservices for the educational institution for the next academic year or\\nterm after reasonable assurance was provided, such employer shall be\\nliable for benefit charges as provided for in this paragraph for any\\nretroactive payments made to the claimant.\\n  (iii) In those instances where the federal government is the\\nclaimant's last employer prior to the filing of the claim for benefits\\nand such employer is not a base-period employer, payments equaling the\\nfirst twenty-eight effective days of benefits as otherwise prescribed by\\nthis section shall be charged to the general account. In those instances\\nwhere the federal government is the claimant's last employer prior to\\nthe filing of the claim for benefits and a base-period employer, such\\nemployer shall be liable for charges for all benefits paid on such claim\\nin the same proportion that the remuneration paid by such employer\\nduring the base period bears to the remuneration paid by all employers\\nduring the base period. In addition, benefit payment charges for the\\nfirst twenty-eight effective days of benefits other than those\\nchargeable to the federal government as prescribed above shall be made\\nto the general account.\\n  (iv) In those instances where a combined wage claim is filed pursuant\\nto interstate reciprocal agreements and the claimant's last employer\\nprior to the filing of the claim is an out-of-state employer and such\\nemployer is not a base-period employer, benefit payments equaling the\\nfirst twenty-eight effective days of benefits as otherwise prescribed by\\nthis section shall be charged to the general account. In those instances\\nwhere the out-of-state employer is the last employer prior to the filing\\nof the claim for benefits and a base-period employer such employer shall\\nbe liable for charges for all benefits paid on such claim in the same\\nproportion that the remuneration paid by such employer during the base\\nperiod bears to the remuneration paid by all employers during the base\\nperiod. In addition, benefit payment charges for the twenty-eight\\neffective days of benefits other than those chargeable to the\\nout-of-state employer as prescribed above shall be made to the general\\naccount.\\n  (v) In those instances where the last employer prior to the filing of\\na valid original claim has paid total remuneration to the claimant\\nduring the period from the start of the base period used to establish\\nthe benefit claim until the date of the claimant's filing of the valid\\noriginal claim in an amount less than or equal to six times the\\nclaimant's benefit rate and the last employer has substantiated such\\namount to the satisfaction of the commissioner within ten days of the\\ncommissioner's original notice of potential charges to such last\\nemployer's account, benefits shall be charged as follows: benefits\\npayable to the claimant with respect to the claimant's then current\\nbenefit year shall be charged, when paid, to the account of such last\\nemployer prior to the filing of a valid original claim in an amount\\nequal to the lowest whole number (one, two, three, four, five, or six)\\ntimes the claimant's benefit rate where the product of such lowest whole\\nnumber times the claimant's benefit rate is equal to or greater than\\nsuch total remuneration paid by such last employer to the claimant.\\nThereafter, such charges shall be made to the account of each employer\\nin the base period used to establish the valid original claim in the\\nsame proportion that the remuneration paid by each employer to the\\nclaimant during that base period bears to the remuneration paid by all\\nemployers to the claimant during that base period. Notice of such\\nrecalculation of potential charges shall be given to the last employer\\nand each employer of the claimant in the base period used to establish\\nthe valid original claim.\\n  (3) An employer's account shall not be charged, and the charges shall\\ninstead be made to the general account, for benefits paid to a claimant\\nafter the expiration of a period of disqualification from benefits\\nfollowing a final determination that the claimant lost employment with\\nthe employer through misconduct or voluntary separation of employment\\nwithout good cause within the meaning of section five hundred\\nninety-three of this article and the charges are attributable to\\nremuneration paid during the claimant's base period of employment with\\nsuch employer prior to the claimant's loss of employment with such\\nemployer through misconduct or voluntary separation of employment\\nwithout good cause, provided, however, that an employer shall not be\\nrelieved of charges pursuant to this subparagraph if an employer or its\\nagent fails to submit information resulting in an overpayment pursuant\\nto section five hundred ninety-seven of this article.\\n  (4)  An employer's account shall not be charged, and the charges shall\\ninstead be made to the general account, for benefits paid to a claimant\\nbased on base period employment while the claimant was an inmate of a\\ncorrectional institution and enrolled in a work release program,\\nprovided that the employment was terminated solely because the inmate\\nwas required to relocate to another area as a condition of parole or the\\ninmate voluntarily  relocated to another area immediately upon being\\nreleased or paroled from such correctional institution.\\n  (5)  If an employer who employed the claimant in the four weeks\\nimmediately preceding the filing of a valid original claim demonstrates\\nthat the employer has continuously employed the claimant without\\nsignificant interruption and substantially to the same extent and in the\\nsame manner as during the weeks immediately preceding the filing of a\\nvalid original claim in which the claimant was employed by such\\nemployer, the account of such employer shall not be charged with\\nbenefits paid to such claimant for any weeks of such continuing\\nemployment, and such experience rating charges shall be made to the\\ngeneral account.  The provisions set forth in the foregoing sentence\\nshall apply with respect to an employer liable for payments in lieu of\\ncontributions, but if the secretary of labor of the United States finds\\nthat their application to such  employer does not meet the requirements\\nof the federal unemployment tax act, such provisions shall not\\nthereafter apply to such employer, unless and until such finding has\\nbeen set aside pursuant to a final decision issued in accordance with\\nsuch judicial review proceedings as may be instituted and completed\\nunder the provisions of section thirty-three hundred ten of the federal\\nunemployment tax act.\\n  (6) An employer's account shall not be debited to the extent that the\\nfederal government reimburses the fund for benefits paid.\\n  If on any computation date an employer's account registers a negative\\nbalance, an amount equivalent to the excess of the negative balance over\\ntwenty-one per centum of the employer's payroll in the payroll year\\npreceding such date shall be transferred as a charge to the general\\naccount, except that this provision shall not apply to any negative\\nbalance, or that portion thereof, which results from benefits charged\\nwith respect to which the employer is liable for payments in lieu of\\ncontributions.\\n  (f) \"Employer's account percentage\" means the status of an employer's\\naccount on any computation date.  It is the balance remaining in the\\naccount, after contributions have been credited and experience rating\\ncharges have been debited to it, stated as percentage of his average\\npayroll for the last five payroll years preceding the computation date\\nor for all quarters if the employer has been liable for contributions\\nfor fewer than twenty-one quarters. Such percentage shall be computed to\\ntwo decimal places and the remaining fraction if any, disregarded. If,\\nhowever, the number of consecutive completed calendar quarters ending on\\nthe computation date during which the employer has been liable for\\ncontributions hereunder is twenty-one or less the employer's account\\npercentage, if it is positive, shall be multiplied by that figure\\nassigned to the employer designated as \"employer's benefit equalization\\nfactor\" which is listed below on the same horizontal line on which the\\nnumber of quarters of employer liability appears, and the product\\nresulting therefrom  shall constitute the employer's account percentage.\\nNumber of quarters                         Employer's benefit\\nof employer liability                      equalization factor\\n          5 ...................................... 3.00\\n          6 ...................................... 2.50\\n          7 ...................................... 2.05\\n          8 ...................................... 1.75\\n          9 ...................................... 1.55\\n          10 ..................................... 1.40\\n          11 ..................................... 1.25\\n          12 ..................................... 1.12\\n          13 ..................................... 1.04\\n          14 through 21........................... 1.00\\n  (g) \"Size of fund index\" means the lesser of the following two\\npercentages:\\n  (1) the percentage obtained by dividing the moneys in the fund as of a\\ncomputation date by the total of all payrolls for the payroll year\\npreceding such date; or (2) the percentage obtained by dividing such\\nmoneys by the average of the totals of all payrolls for the five\\nconsecutive payroll years preceding such date. Such percentage shall be\\ncomputed to one decimal place and the remaining fraction, if any,\\ndisregarded.\\n  (h) \"Payroll\" means all wages paid by an employer to his employees.\\n  2. Rates of contribution.\\n  (a) Each qualified employer's rate of contribution shall be the\\npercentage shown in the column headed by the size of the fund index as\\nof the computation date and on the same line with his or her negative or\\npositive employer's account percentage, except that if within the three\\npayroll years preceding the computation date any part of a negative\\nbalance has been transferred from any employer's account as a charge to\\nthe general account pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (e) of\\nsubdivision one of this section such employer's rate of

or equal to eighty percent of\\nthe previous three payroll year's average total wages paid by the\\nemployer, then such employer's account percentage for the subsequent\\nyear shall be improved by four percentage points for purposes of\\ndetermining the employer's rate of contribution. However, in no event\\nshall the resulting rate of contribution after such adjustment be less\\nthan 6.1 percent. Such adjustment to the employer's account percentage\\nshall be applicable only to the employer's current rate of contribution\\nand the application of such adjustment shall be redetermined annually.\\n  (ii)  The terms \"qualified employer\", \"employer's account percentage\",\\n\"computation date\", \"wages\", \"payroll year\" and \"rate of contribution\"\\nshall have the meaning prescribed pursuant to article eighteen of this\\nchapter.\\n  (b) Penalty for failure to file required returns. (1) In the case of a\\nfailure by an employer to file a quarterly combined withholding wage\\nreporting and unemployment insurance return required by paragraph four\\nof subsection (a) of section six hundred seventy-four of the tax law,\\nthere shall be imposed a penalty of five percent of the amount of\\ncontributions required to be shown on such return (including the amount\\nof any assessment or modification made pursuant to this section) if the\\nfailure is for not more than one month with an additional five percent\\npenalty for each additional month or fraction thereof during which such\\nfailure continues, not exceeding twenty-five percent in the aggregate.\\n  (2) The penalty provided for failure to file a return under this\\nparagraph shall not be less than one hundred dollars for each\\noccurrence.\\n  (3) For purposes of this paragraph, the amount of contributions\\nrequired to be shown on such return shall be reduced by the amount of\\nany part of the contributions due which is paid on or before the date\\nthe return is required to be filed and by the amount of any credit to\\nthe contributions due which may be claimed upon such return.\\n  (4) For other penalties relating to failure to file the quarterly\\ncombined withholding, wage reporting and unemployment insurance return,\\nsee paragraph one of subsection (v) of section six hundred eighty-five\\nof the tax law.\\n  (5) The penalties imposed and collected pursuant to this paragraph\\nshall be credited to the unemployment insurance control fund established\\npursuant to section five hundred fifty-two-b of this article.\\n  (c) The rate for any employer who has not qualified under the\\nprovisions of paragraph (c) of subdivision one of this section solely\\nbecause he has not been liable for contributions during at least the\\nfive completed calendar quarters ending on the computation date, or\\nbecause he has not paid any remuneration in the payroll year preceding\\nthe computation date, shall be equal to the rate which applies pursuant\\nto paragraph (a) of this subdivision to an employer who has a positive\\naccount percentage of less than one percentum, except that the rate for\\nsuch employer shall in no event exceed three and four-tenths per centum.\\n  (d) The rates established in accordance with the provisions of this\\nsubdivision shall apply with respect to wages paid in the four\\nconsecutive calendar quarters immediately following the computation\\ndate.\\n  3. Joint accounts. Any two or more qualified employers engaged in the\\nsame or a related trade, occupation, profession or enterprise, or having\\na common financial interest may apply to the commissioner to establish a\\njoint account or to merge their several individual accounts in a joint\\naccount. The commissioner shall prescribe rules and regulations for the\\nestablishment, maintenance and dissolution of joint accounts. A joint\\naccount shall be maintained as if it constituted a single employer's\\naccount. Rules established by the commissioner pursuant to the\\nprovisions of this subdivision shall be promulgated only after notice\\nand public hearing.\\n  4. Transfers of accounts. (a) Where an employer subsequent to July\\nfirst, nineteen hundred fifty-one, transfers his or its organization,\\ntrade or business in whole or in part, the transferee shall take over\\nand continue the employer's account, including its balance and all other\\naspects of its experience under this article, in proportion to the\\npayroll or employees assignable to the transferred organization, trade\\nor business determined for the purpose of this article by the\\ncommissioner. The account taken over by the transferee shall remain\\nchargeable with respect to benefits based on employment in the\\ntransferred organization, trade or business, and all such employment\\nshall be deemed employment performed for the transferee.\\n  (b) The rate of contribution applicable to the accounts of the\\ntransferee and the transferring employer with respect to the calendar\\nyear in which the transfer occurred shall be respectively determined or\\nredetermined as of the computation date in the preceding calendar year,\\nand such rates shall apply from the date of the transfer to the end of\\nthe calendar year in which the transfer occurred. The rate of\\ncontribution applicable to the accounts of the transferee and the\\ntransferring employer with respect to the calendar year following the\\ncalendar year in which the transfer occurred shall be respectively\\ndetermined or redetermined as of the computation date in the same\\ncalendar year. The commissioner shall allocate to the transferee's\\naccount for each period in question the proportion of the transferring\\nemployer's payroll, which the commissioner determines to be properly\\nassignable to the organization, trade or business transferred.\\n  (c) No transfer shall be deemed to have occurred if the commissioner\\non his own motion or on application of any interested party finds that\\nall of the following conditions exist:\\n  (1) the transferee has not assumed any of the transferring employer's\\nobligations, and\\n  (2) the transferee has not acquired any of the transferring employer's\\ngood will, and\\n  (3) the transferee has not continued or resumed the business of the\\ntransferring employer either in the same establishment or elsewhere, and\\n  (4) the transferee has not employed substantially the same employees\\nas those the transferring employer had employed in connection with the\\norganization, trade, business, or part thereof transferred.\\n  (d) No transfer shall be deemed to have occurred unless either the\\ntransferring employer or the transferee has given notice of the transfer\\nto the commissioner prior to the termination of the calendar year\\nfollowing the calendar year in which the transfer occurred.\\n  5. Interstate transfer of experience. An employer who transfers all or\\na segregable part of his operations from another state to this state\\nshall be deemed to be a qualified employer within the meaning of this\\nsection as of the computation date next following the transfer,\\nprovided:\\n  (a) that he has paid wages subject to the federal unemployment tax act\\nfor eighteen consecutive completed calendar quarters immediately\\npreceding the computation date;\\n  (b) that he notifies the commissioner of the transfer of operations\\nprior to the computation date;\\n  (c) that he certifies to the commissioner all information with respect\\nto the transferred operations which the commissioner determines to be\\nnecessary; and\\n  (d) that he certifies to the commissioner at such times as the\\ncommissioner prescribes all information which the commissioner\\ndetermines to be necessary with respect to benefits paid subsequent to\\nthe transfer and prior to each computation date on the basis of wages\\npaid in such other state.\\n  Wages, remuneration, contributions and benefits resulting in\\nexperience rating charges in connection with the transferred operations\\nshall be deemed to have been paid in this state for the purposes of this\\nsection.\\n  In computing such employer's balance applicable to the transferred\\noperations, the commissioner shall consider only the fourteen most\\nrecently elapsed calendar quarters prior to the computation date. Any\\nbalance set up under this subdivision shall be debited to the general\\naccount; and benefits subsequently paid based on wages paid in such\\nother state shall be charged to the employer's account and credited to\\nthe general account.\\n  6. Corrections and modifications. Corrections or modifications of an\\nemployer's payroll, experience rating charges, or any other pertinent\\nfactor shall not be taken into account for the purpose of a\\ndetermination or redetermination of the employer's contribution rate,\\nunless such corrections or modifications were established on or before\\nthe computation date; except that they shall be taken into account\\nwhenever established if the employer filed false returns with intent to\\ndefraud or, with respect to payroll, failed to file returns prior to the\\ncomputation date such that an amount of contributions due from such\\nemployer and/or an amount of wages paid by such employer was required to\\nbe determined by the commissioner pursuant to section five hundred\\nseventy-one of this article and such corrections or modifications result\\nin a rate higher than the contribution rate determined by the\\ncommissioner or, with respect to experience rating charges, if they\\nresult from a referee, appeal board, or court decision.\\n  7. Certain transfers. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the\\nfollowing shall apply regarding assignment of rates and transfers of\\nexperience:\\n  (a)(1) If an employer transfers its organization, trade or business,\\nor a portion thereof, to another employer and, at the time of the\\ntransfer, there is at least ten percent common ownership, management or\\ncontrol of the two employers, then the unemployment experience\\nattributable to the transferred organization, trade or business shall be\\ntransferred to the employer to whom such organization, trade or business\\nis so transferred.  In addition to the provisions of this subdivision,\\nthe transfer provisions of paragraphs (a), (b) and (d) of subdivision\\nfour of this section shall apply to such transfers. For purposes of this\\nsubdivision \"organization, trade or business\" shall include the\\nemployer's workforce.\\n  (2) If, following a transfer of experience under subparagraph one of\\nthis paragraph, the commissioner determines that a substantial purpose\\nof the transfer of the organization, trade or business was to obtain a\\nreduced liability for contributions, then the experience rating accounts\\nof the employers involved shall be combined into a single account and a\\nsingle rate shall be assigned to such account.\\n  (b) Whenever a person is not an employer liable for contributions\\nunder this article at the time it acquires the organization, trade or\\nbusiness of an employer, the unemployment experience of the acquired\\nbusiness shall not be transferred to such person if the commissioner\\nfinds that such person acquired the business solely or primarily for the\\npurpose of obtaining a lower rate of contributions. Instead, such person\\nshall be assigned a rate in accordance with paragraph (c) of subdivision\\ntwo of this section. In determining whether the organization, trade or\\nbusiness was acquired solely or primarily for the purpose of obtaining a\\nlower rate of contributions, the commissioner shall evaluate factors\\nthat include, but are not limited to the following:\\n  (1) the cost of acquiring the organization, trade or business;\\n  (2) whether the person continued the business enterprise of the\\nacquired business;\\n  (3) how long such business enterprise was continued; or\\n  (4) whether a substantial number of new employees were hired for\\nperformance of duties unrelated to the business activity conducted prior\\nto acquisition.\\n  (c)(1) If a person knowingly violates or attempts to violate\\nparagraphs (a) or (b) of this subdivision, then such person shall be\\nliable for the greater penalty of ten percent of such person's total\\ntaxable wages in the last completed payroll year or ten thousand\\ndollars. Any such penalty shall be deposited in the control fund\\nestablished under section five hundred fifty-two-b of this article.\\n  (2) If a person knowingly advises another person to violate or attempt\\nto violate paragraph (a) or (b) of this subdivision, then such advisor\\nshall be subject to a civil penalty of ten thousand dollars. Any such\\npenalty shall be deposited in the control fund established under section\\nfive hundred fifty-two-b of this article.\\n  (3) For purposes of this subdivision, the term \"knowingly\" means\\nhaving actual knowledge of or acting with deliberate ignorance or\\nreckless disregard for the prohibition involved.\\n  (4) For purposes of this subdivision, the term \"violates or attempts\\nto violate\" includes, but is not limited to, intent to evade,\\nmisrepresentation or wilful nondisclosure.\\n  (5) In addition to the penalties imposed by subparagraphs one and two\\nof this paragraph, any violation of this subdivision shall be a class E\\nfelony and is punishable by a term of imprisonment as prescribed in\\nsection 70.00 of the penal law.\\n  (d) The commissioner shall establish procedures to identify the\\ntransfer or acquisition of a business for purposes of this subdivision.\\n  (e) For purposes of this subdivision the term \"person\" has the meaning\\ngiven such term by section 7701 (a)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of\\n1986, and shall also include an employer as defined in this article.\\n",

Contributions to the interest assessment surcharge fund. 1.\\nEach employer that is liable for contributions under this article shall\\npay an assessment to the commissioner at a rate established annually by\\nthe commissioner sufficient to pay interest due on advances from the\\nfederal unemployment account under Title XII of the Social Security Act\\n(42 U.S. Code Sections 1321 to 1324) during any period that such\\ninterest will accrue. The rate shall be applied to wages as defined in\\nsection five hundred eighteen of this article effective as of the\\nbeginning of the first calendar quarter of the year such interest\\nbecomes due. The commissioner shall establish the necessary procedures\\nfor payment of such assessments. The amounts received by the\\ncommissioner based on such assessments shall be paid over and credited\\nto the interest assessment surcharge fund.

Such credits\\nshall be determined based on the percentage of each employer's wages to\\nthe total statewide wages of the payroll year and credited to each\\nemployer's account as of the computation date of the year prior to which\\nsuch assessment shall no longer be levied. The provisions of law\\napplicable to the collection of contributions shall apply to the\\ncollection of such assessments.\\n  2.

Refusal of employment. No days of total unemployment shall be\\ndeemed to occur beginning with the day on which a claimant, without good\\ncause, refuses to accept an offer of employment for which he or she is\\nreasonably fitted by training and experience, including employment not\\nsubject to this article, until he or she has subsequently worked in\\nemployment and earned remuneration at least equal to ten times his or\\nher weekly benefit rate.

Criminal acts. No days of total unemployment shall be deemed to\\noccur during a period of twelve months after a claimant loses employment\\nas a result of an act constituting a felony in connection with such\\nemployment, provided the claimant is duly convicted thereof or has\\nsigned a statement admitting that he or she has committed such an act.\\nDeterminations regarding a benefit claim may be reviewed at any time.\\nAny benefits paid to a claimant prior to a determination that the\\nclaimant has lost employment as a result of such act shall not be\\nconsidered to have been accepted by the claimant in good faith.

There are persons employed in some\\noccupations in the state of New York at wages insufficient to provide\\nadequate maintenance for themselves and their families. Such employment\\nimpairs the health, efficiency, and well-being of the persons so\\nemployed, constitutes unfair competition against other employers and\\ntheir employees, threatens the stability of industry, reduces the\\npurchasing power of employees, and requires, in many instances, that\\nwages be supplemented by the payment of public moneys for relief or\\nother public and private assistance. Employment of persons at these\\ninsufficient rates of pay threatens the health and well-being of the\\npeople of this state and injures the overall economy.\\n  Accordingly, it is the declared policy of the state of New York that\\nsuch conditions be eliminated as rapidly as practicable without\\nsubstantially curtailing opportunities for employment or earning power.\\nTo this end minimum wage standards shall be established and maintained.\\n",

Any\\nminimum wage order and regulation issued by the commissioner pursuant to\\nthis article shall, unless appealed from as provided in this section, be\\nfinal. The findings of the commissioner as to the facts shall be\\nconclusive on any appeal from an order of the commissioner issued\\npursuant to sections six hundred fifty-two, six hundred fifty-six, or\\nsix hundred fifty-nine.\\n  2. Review by board of standards and appeals. Any person in interest,\\nincluding a labor organization or employer association, in any\\noccupation for which a minimum wage order or regulation has been issued\\nunder the provisions of this article who is aggrieved by such order or\\nregulation may obtain review before the board of standards and appeals\\nby filing with said board, within forty-five days after the date of the\\npublication of the notice of such order or regulation, a written\\npetition requesting that the order or regulation be modified or set\\naside. A copy of such petition shall be served promptly upon the\\ncommissioner. On such appeal, the commissioner shall certify and file\\nwith the board of standards and appeals a transcript of the entire\\nrecord, including the testimony and evidence upon which such order or\\nregulation was made and the report of the wage board. The board of\\nstandards and appeals, upon the record certified and filed by the\\ncommissioner, shall, after oral argument, determine whether the order or\\nregulation appealed from is contrary to law. Within forty-five days\\nafter the expiration of the time for the filing of a petition, the board\\nof standards and appeals shall issue an order confirming, amending or\\nsetting aside the order or regulation appealed from. The appellate\\njurisdiction of the board of standards and appeals shall be exclusive\\nand its order final except that the same shall be subject to an appeal\\ntaken directly to the appellate division of the supreme court, third\\njudicial department, within sixty days after its order is issued. The\\ncommissioner shall be considered an aggrieved party entitled to take an\\nappeal from an order of the board of standards and appeals.\\n  3. Security. The taking of an appeal by an employer to the board of\\nstandards and appeals shall not operate as a stay of a minimum wage\\norder or regulation issued under this article unless and until, and only\\nso long as, the employer shall have provided security determined by the\\nboard of standards and appeals in accordance with this section. The\\nsecurity shall be sufficient to guarantee to the employees affected the\\npayment of the difference between the wage they receive and the minimum\\nwage they would be entitled to receive under the terms of the minimum\\nwage order or regulation (such difference being hereinafter referred to\\nas \"underpayments\") in the event that such order or regulation is\\naffirmed by the board of standards and appeals. The security shall be\\neither:\\n  a. A bond filed with the board of standards and appeals issued by a\\nfidelity or surety company authorized to do business in this state. The\\nbond shall be sufficient to cover the amount of underpayments due at the\\ntime the bond is filed with the board of standards and appeals and the\\namount of underpayments that can reasonably be expected to accrue within\\nthe following sixty days; or\\n  b. An escrow account established by the employer in behalf of\\nemployees and deposited in a bank or trust company in this state, of\\nwhich the employer has notified the board of standards and appeals in\\nwriting that he has established such account. The account shall be\\nsufficient to cover the amount of underpayments due at the time of\\nnotification to the board of standards and appeals and shall be kept\\ncurrent by the employer depositing therein the amount of underpayments\\naccruing each and every pay period. Such deposits shall be made no later\\nthan the day on which the wages for each pay period are payable.  As an\\nalternative thereto, an employer may deposit the amount of underpayments\\ndue at the time the deposit is made and the amount of underpayments that\\ncan reasonably be expected to accrue within the following sixty days, as\\ndetermined by the board of standards and appeals. The employer shall\\nkeep accurate records showing the total amount of each deposit, the\\nperiod covered, and the name and address of each employee and the amount\\ndeposited to his account. The employees' escrow account shall be deemed\\nto be a trust fund for the benefit of the employees affected, and no\\nbank or trust company shall release funds in such account without the\\nwritten approval of the board of standards and appeals.\\n  4. Maintenance of security. The commissioner, at the request and on\\nbehalf of the board of standards and appeals, shall have the right to\\ninspect the books and records of every employer who appeals from an\\norder or who provides a security in accordance with subdivision eight of\\nthis section. In the event that the board of standards and appeals finds\\nthat the security provided by an employer is insufficient to cover the\\namount of underpayments, it shall notify the employer to increase the\\namount of the security. If the employer fails to increase the security\\nto the amount requested within seven days after such notice, the stay\\nshall be terminated. If the board of standards and appeals finds that\\nthe amount of the security is excessive, it shall decrease the amount of\\nsecurity required.\\n  5. Review of determination as to security. Notwithstanding any\\nprovision in this chapter, any determination of the board of standards\\nand appeals with reference to subdivisions three and four of this\\nsection shall be reviewable only by a special proceeding under article\\nseventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules instituted in the\\nsupreme court in the third judicial district within ten days after such\\ndetermination.\\n  6. Security on court review. In the event that an appeal is taken from\\nthe order of the board of standards and appeals to the supreme court in\\nthe third judicial district pursuant to subdivision two of this section,\\nthe court may continue the security in effect or require such security\\nas it deems proper.\\n  7. Waiver of security. Notwithstanding any provision in this section,\\nthe board of standards and appeals may, in its discretion, waive the\\nrequirement of a security for an employer who the board of standards and\\nappeals finds is of such financial responsibility that payments to\\nemployees of any underpayments due or to accrue are assured without the\\nsecurity provided by this section.\\n  8. Stay for other employers. Any employer affected by a minimum wage\\norder or regulation from which an appeal has been taken by another\\nemployer to the board of standards and appeals or to the supreme court\\nin the third judicial district, may obtain a stay of proceedings against\\nhim by providing a security in accordance with subdivisions three and\\nfour of this section within thirty days after the filing of the appeal\\nby the other employer.\\n",

The security\\nshall be sufficient to guarantee to the employees affected the payment\\nof the difference between the wage they receive and the minimum wage\\nthey would be entitled to receive under the terms of the minimum wage\\nregulation (such difference being hereinafter referred to as\\n\"underpayments\") in the event that such regulation is affirmed by the\\nboard of standards and appeals. The security shall be either:\\n  a. A bond filed with the board of standards and appeals issued by a\\nfidelity or surety company authorized to do business in this state.  The\\nbond shall be sufficient to cover the amount of underpayments due at the\\ntime the bond is filed with the board of standards and appeals and the\\namount of underpayments that can reasonably be expected to accrue within\\nthe following sixty days; or\\n  b. An escrow account established by the employer in behalf of\\nemployees and, deposited in a bank or trust company in this state, of\\nwhich the employer has notified the board of standards and appeals in\\nwriting that he has established such account. The account shall be\\nsufficient to cover the amount of underpayments due at the time of\\nnotification to the board of standards and appeals and shall be kept\\ncurrent by the employer depositing therein the amount of underpayments\\naccruing each and every pay period. Such deposits shall be made no later\\nthan the day on which the wages for each pay period are payable. As an\\nalternative thereto, an employer may deposit the amount of underpayments\\ndue at the time the deposit is made and the amount of underpayments that\\ncan reasonably be expected to accrue within the following sixty days, as\\ndetermined by the board of standards and appeals. The employer shall\\nkeep accurate records showing the total amount of each deposit, the\\nperiod covered, and the name and address of each employee and the amount\\ndeposited to his account. The employees escrow account shall be deemed\\nto be a trust fund for the benefit of the employees affected, and no\\nbank or trust company shall release funds in such account without the\\nwritten approval of the board of standards and appeals.\\n  4. Maintenance of security. The commissioner, at the request and on\\nbehalf of the board of standards and appeals, shall have the right to\\ninspect the books and records of every employer who appeals or who\\nprovides a security in accordance with subdivision eight of this\\nsection. In the event that the board of standards and appeals finds that\\nthe security provided by an employer is insufficient to cover the amount\\nof underpayments, it shall notify the employer to increase the amount of\\nthe security. If the employer fails to increase the security of the\\namount requested within seven days after such notice, the stay shall be\\nterminated. If the board of standards and appeals finds that the amount\\nof the security is excessive, it shall decrease the amount of security\\nrequired.\\n  5. Review of determination as to security. Notwithstanding any\\nprovision in this chapter, any determination of the board of standards\\nand appeals with reference to subdivisions three and four of this\\nsection shall be reviewable only by a special proceeding under article\\nseventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules instituted in the\\nsupreme court in the third judicial district within ten days after such\\ndetermination.\\n  6. Security on court review. In the event that an appeal is taken from\\nthe order of the board of standards and appeals to the supreme court in\\nthe third judicial district pursuant to subdivision two of this section,\\nthe court may continue the security in effect or require such security\\nas it deems proper.\\n  7. Waiver of security. Notwithstanding any provision in this section,\\nthe board of standards and appeals may, in its discretion, waive the\\nrequirement of a security for an employer who the board of standards and\\nappeals finds is of such financial responsibility that payments to\\nemployees of any underpayments due or to accrue are assured without the\\nsecurity provided by this section.\\n  8. Stay for other employers. Any employer affected by a minimum wage\\nregulation from which an appeal has been taken by another employer to\\nthe board of standards and appeals or to the supreme court in the third\\njudicial district, may obtain a stay of proceedings against him by\\nproviding a security in accordance with subdivisions three and four of\\nthis section within thirty days after the filing of the appeal by the\\nother employer.\\n",

Representatives designated by\\nthe board after a showing of majority interest or selected for the\\npurposes of collective bargaining by the majority of the employees in a\\nunit appropriate for such purposes or by the majority of the employees\\nvoting in an election conducted pursuant to this section shall be the\\nexclusive representatives of all the employees in the appropriate unit\\nfor the purposes of collective bargaining in respect to rates of pay,\\nwages, hours of employment, or other conditions of employment: Provided,\\nthat employees, directly or through representatives, shall have the\\nright at any time to present grievances to their employer.\\n  The board shall designate a representative for purposes of collective\\nbargaining when such representative demonstrates a showing of majority\\ninterest by employees in the unit. In cases where the parties to a\\ndispute are without agreement on the means to ascertain the choice, if\\nany, of employee organization as their representative, the board shall\\nascertain such employees' choice of employee organization, on the basis\\nof dues deduction authorization and other evidence, or if necessary by\\nconducting an election. In the event that either party provides to the\\nboard, prior to the designation of a representative, clear and\\nconvincing evidence that the dues deduction authorizations, and other\\nevidence upon which the board would otherwise rely to ascertain the\\nemployees' choice of representative, are fraudulent or were obtained\\nthrough coercion, the board shall promptly thereafter conduct an\\nelection. The board shall also investigate and consider a party's\\nallegations that the dues deduction authorizations and other evidences\\nsubmitted in support of a designation of representative without an\\nelection were subsequently changed, altered, withdrawn or withheld as a\\nresult of employer fraud, coercion or any other unfair employer labor\\npractice as defined in section seven hundred four of this article. If\\nthe board determines that a representative would have had a majority\\ninterest but for the employer's fraud, coercion or unfair labor\\npractice, it shall designate the representative without the conduct of\\nan election.\\n  1-a. If the choice available to the employees in a negotiating unit is\\nlimited to selecting or rejecting a single employee organization, that\\nchoice shall be ascertained by the board on the basis of dues deduction\\nauthorizations instead of by an election. In such case, the employee\\norganization involved will be certified without an election if a\\nmajority of the employees within the unit have executed a showing dues\\ndeductions authorizations.\\n  2. The board shall decide in each case whether, in order to insure to\\nemployees the full benefit of their right to self-organization, to\\ncollective bargaining and otherwise to effectuate the policies of this\\narticle, the unit appropriate for the purposes of collective bargaining\\nshall be the employer unit, multiple employer unit, craft unit, plant\\nunit, or any other unit; provided, however, that in any case where the\\nmajority of employees of a particular craft, or in the case of a\\nnon-profitmaking hospital or residential care center where the majority\\nof employees of a particular profession or craft, shall so decide the\\nboard shall designate such profession or craft as a unit appropriate for\\nthe purpose of collective bargaining.\\n  3. Whenever it is alleged by an employee or his representative, or by\\nan employer or his representative, that there is a question or\\ncontroversy concerning the representation of employees, the board shall\\ninvestigate such question or controversy and certify in writing to all\\npersons concerned the name or names of the representatives who have been\\ndesignated or selected. In any such investigation the board shall\\nprovide for an appropriate hearing upon due notice, either in conjuction\\nwith a proceeding under section seven hundred six or otherwise, and may\\nconduct an election by secret ballot of employees, or use any other\\nsuitable method to ascertain such representatives (either before or\\nafter the aforesaid hearing), provided, however, that the board shall\\nnot have authority to investigate or determine any question or\\ncontroversy between individuals or groups within the same labor\\norganization nor between labor organizations affiliated with the same\\nparent labor organization concerning the internal affairs of any labor\\norganization but nothing contained in this proviso shall be deemed to\\npreclude the board from investigating and determining which, if any, of\\naffiliated groups or labor organizations have been designated or\\nselected by employees as their representatives for the purposes of\\ncollective bargaining within the meaning of this article.\\n  4. The board shall have power to determine who may participate in the\\nelection and to establish the rules governing any such election:\\nProvided, that no election need be directed by the board solely because\\nof the request of an employer or of employees prompted thereto by their\\nemployer, nor shall any individuals employed only for the duration of a\\nstrike or lockout be eligible to vote in such election; and provided\\nfurther, that no such election shall be conducted under the employer's\\nsupervision, or, except as may be required by the board, on the\\nemployer's property, during working hours, or with his participation or\\nassistance.\\n  5. If at an election conducted pursuant to this section three or more\\nnominees for exclusive collective bargaining representatives appear on\\nthe ballot and no one of them receives a majority of the votes cast at\\nthe election, the two nominees who received the highest number of votes\\nshall appear on the ballot of a second election to be conducted\\nhereunder, and the one receiving a majority of the votes cast at the\\nsecond election shall be the exclusive representative of all the\\nemployees in such unit for the purpose of collective bargaining in\\nrespect to rates of pay, wages, hours of employment, or other conditions\\nof employment.\\n  6. A labor organization nominated as the representative of employees\\nshall be listed by name on the ballots authorized by subdivision three\\nof this section. In any investigation conducted by the board pursuant to\\nthis section the board may make a finding as to whether any committee,\\nemployee representation plan, or association of employees involved is a\\ncompany union, and if any such committee, employee representation plan,\\nor association of employees be found to be a company union, it shall not\\nbe listed on the ballots, certified or otherwise recognized as eligible\\nto be the representative of employees under this article.\\n",

As used in this section \"grievance\" means\\nany controversy or claim arising out of or relating to the\\ninterpretation, application or breach of the provisions of an existing\\ncollective bargaining contract. As used in this section \"dispute\" means\\nall other controversies, claims or disputes between the employees of a\\nnon-profitmaking hospital or residential care center, or their\\nrepresentatives, and such hospital or residential care center concerning\\nwages, hours, union security, seniority or other economic matters,\\nincluding, but not limited to, controversies, claims or disputes arising\\nin the course of negotiating, fixing, maintaining, changing or arranging\\nsuch terms or conditions.\\n  2. Every collective bargaining contract between the employees of a\\nnon-profitmaking hospital or residential care center, or their\\nrepresentatives, and such hospital or residential care center which does\\nnot contain provisions for the final and binding determination of\\ngrievances shall be deemed to include provision for the submission of\\nsuch grievances, upon the request of either or both parties, to final\\nand binding arbitration pursuant to such rules as may be established\\nfrom time to time by the board.\\n  3.

The commissioner or the board may\\nsubmit a dispute to final and binding arbitration pursuant to this\\nparagraph without first submitting it to a fact-finding commission\\npursuant to the preceding paragraph of this subdivision.\\n  4. In the absence of a collective bargaining contract between the\\nemployees of a non-profitmaking hospital or residential care center, or\\ntheir representatives, and such hospital or residential care center, the\\nboard and the commissioner may, in the manner and upon the conditions\\nprovided in subdivision three of this section, exercise all of the\\npowers vested in them by the provisions of such subdivision of such\\nsection.\\n  5.

The\\nprovisions of section eight hundred seven of this chapter shall not\\napply to an action or proceeding instituted pursuant to this section or\\nsection seven hundred thirteen.\\n  7. The fact-finders and arbitrators appointed pursuant to subdivision\\nthree of this section may consider the following standards in arriving\\nat a final arbitration decision in disputes referred to them:\\n  (a) the interest and welfare of the public;\\n  (b) changes in the cost of living as they affect employees' purchasing\\npower;\\n  (c) comparison of the wages, hours and conditions of employment of the\\nemployees involved in the arbitration proceedings, and the wages, hours\\nand conditions of employment of employees doing the same, similar or\\ncomparable work or work requiring the same, similar or comparable skills\\nand expenditures of energy and effort, giving consideration to such\\nfactors as are peculiar to the industry involved;\\n  (d) comparison of wages, hours and conditions of employment as\\nreflected in non-profitmaking hospitals and residential care centers in\\nother comparable areas;\\n  (e) the security and tenure of employment with due regard for the\\neffect of technological changes thereon as well as the effect of any\\nunique skills, required training and other attributes developed in the\\nindustry and required for the job;\\n  (f) economic factors of the respective parties which are relevant to\\nthe arbitration decision;\\n  (g) such other factors not confined to the foregoing which are\\nnormally or traditionally taken into consideration in the determination\\nof wages, hours and conditions of employment through voluntary\\ncollective bargaining arbitration or otherwise between the parties or in\\nthe industry.\\n  8.

If such\\nunfair labor practice charge has been filed, (1) no application made\\npursuant to section seventy-five hundred three of the civil practice law\\nand rules, or otherwise, shall be granted to stay fact-finding or\\narbitration under this section; (2) the court shall consolidate the\\npetitions and applications filed pursuant to paragraphs (a) and (b) of\\nsubdivision six of this section; and (3) no arbitration award made\\npursuant to this subdivision shall become effective until there has been\\na final determination that the labor organization has the right to\\nexclusive representation of the employees in the unit with respect to\\nwhich such award was made, pursuant to sections seven hundred five and\\nseven hundred seven of this article, provided that nothing herein shall\\nbe interpreted to limit the discretion of the arbitrators to make such\\naward retroactive.\\n  9. Notwithstanding the provisions of section eight hundred seven of\\nthe labor law, where it appears that there may have been a violation of\\nsection seven hundred thirteen of this article, the chief executive\\nofficer of the non-profitmaking hospital or residential care center\\ninvolved, or, in the case of a lockout, any affected employee or his\\ncertified representative, shall forthwith apply to the supreme court for\\nan injunction against such violation.

If an order of the court\\nenjoining or restraining such violation does not receive compliance,\\nsuch chief executive officer, employee or his representative, or chief\\nlegal officer, as the case may be, shall forthwith apply to the supreme\\ncourt to punish such violation under section seven hundred fifty of the\\njudiciary law. As used in this paragraph, the term \"chief executive\\nofficer\" shall mean (i) in the case of cities, the mayor, except in\\nthose cities having a city manager, it shall mean such city manager;\\n(ii) in the case of villages, the mayor, except in those villages having\\na president or manager, it shall mean such latter officer; and (iii) in\\nthe case of towns, the supervisor or presiding supervisor.\\n",

The rights of employees to organize and to\\nbargain collectively through labor organizations of their own choosing\\nhave been affirmatively protected by the constitution and statutes of\\nthis state and by parallel federal laws. Encouraged by these laws, a\\nsubstantial proportion of the employees in this state have become\\nmembers of, and contribute financially to, labor organizations for the\\npurpose of bargaining collectively with their employers concerning wages\\nand other conditions of employment. To the officers and agents of their\\nlabor organizations, these employees have entrusted their funds and the\\npower to act in their behalf in achieving the purposes of their labor\\norganizations.\\n  Experience has shown instances where officers and agents of some labor\\norganizations have abused their positions of fiduciary responsibility.\\n  Experience has also shown instances in which some employers, employer\\norganizations and labor relations consultants have participated in or\\ninduced such abuses of fiduciary responsibility by officers and agents\\nof such labor organizations.\\n  Responsible leaders of the labor movement have recognized that union\\nofficers and agents have a fiduciary duty to serve the members of the\\nunion honestly and faithfully, and these leaders have taken courageous\\naction against those who have violated their trust. Experience, however,\\nhas shown that labor's efforts to correct abuses from within need to be\\naided and supplemented by legislation.\\n  Such abuses have had a harmful effect on the general welfare, health\\nand safety of employees and the public. Accordingly, it is hereby\\ndeclared to be the public policy of the state of New York that officers\\nand agents of a labor organization shall be held to a fiduciary\\nobligation in handling the labor organization's assets; that such\\nofficers and agents shall not acquire financial interests which\\ninterfere or tend to interfere with the faithful performance of their\\nresponsibility to the labor organization; and that such officers and\\nagents shall account fully to the members of such labor organization for\\nall assets and financial transactions. It is hereby further declared to\\nbe the public policy of the state of New York that employers, employer\\norganizations, labor relations consultants and other persons shall not\\nparticipate in or induce violations of such fiduciary obligation by\\nofficers and agents of labor organizations.\\n",

No court nor any judge\\nor judges thereof shall have jurisdiction to issue any restraining order\\nor a temporary or permanent injunction in any case involving or growing\\nout of a labor dispute, as hereinafter defined, except after a hearing,\\nand except after findings of all the following facts by the court or\\njudge or judges thereof to be filed in the record of the case:\\n  (a) That unlawful acts have or a breach of any contract not contrary\\nto public policy has been threatened or committed and that such acts or\\nbreach will be executed or continued unless restrained;\\n  (b) That substantial and irreparable injury to complainant's property\\nwill follow unless the relief requested is granted;\\n  (c) That as to each item of relief granted greater injury will be\\ninflicted upon complainant by the denial thereof than will be inflicted\\nupon defendants by the granting thereof;\\n  (d) That complainant has no adequate remedy at law;\\n  (e) That the public officers charged with the duty to protect\\ncomplainant's property have failed or are unable to furnish adequate\\nprotection; and\\n  (f) That no item of relief granted prohibits directly or indirectly\\nany person or persons from doing, whether singly or in concert, any of\\nthe following acts:\\n  (1) Ceasing or refusing to perform any work or to remain in any\\nrelation of employment;\\n  (2) Becoming or remaining a member of any labor organization or of any\\nemployer organization, regardless of any agreement, undertaking or\\npromise;\\n  (3) Paying or giving to, or withholding from, any person any strike or\\nunemployment benefits or insurance or other moneys or things of value;\\n  (4) By all lawful means aiding any person who is being proceeded\\nagainst in, or is prosecuting any action or suit in any court of the\\nUnited States or of any state;\\n  (5) Giving publicity to and obtaining or communicating information\\nregarding the existence of, or the facts involved in, any dispute,\\nwhether by advertising, speaking, picketing, patrolling any public\\nstreet or any place where any person or persons may lawfully be, or by\\nany other method not involving fraud, violence or breach of the peace;\\n  (6) Ceasing to patronize or to employ any person or persons;\\n  (7) Assembling peaceably to do or to organize to do any of the acts\\nheretofore specified or to promote lawful interests;\\n  (8) Advising or notifying any person or persons of any intention to do\\nany of the acts heretofore specified;\\n  (9) Agreeing with other persons to do or not to do any of the acts\\nheretofore specified;\\n  (10) Advising, urging or inducing without fraud, violence or threat\\nthereof, others to do the acts heretofore specified;\\n  (11) Doing in concert of any or all of the acts heretofore specified\\non the ground that the persons engaged therein constitute an unlawful\\ncombination or conspiracy or on any other grounds whatsoever.\\n  2. Such hearings shall be held only after a verified complaint\\nspecifying in detail the time, place and the nature of the acts\\ncomplained of and the names of the persons alleged to have committed the\\nsame or participated therein have been served and after due and personal\\nnotice, in such manner as the court shall direct, has been given to all\\nknown persons against whom relief is sought and also to the public\\nofficers charged with the duty to protect the complainant's property.\\nThe hearing shall consist of the taking of testimony in open court with\\nopportunity for cross-examination and testimony in opposition thereto,\\nif offered, and no affidavits shall be received in support of any of the\\nallegations of the complaint.\\n  Provided, however, that a court or a judge thereof may issue a\\nrestraining order without requiring a verified bill of particulars and\\nonly upon such notice as to the court or judge appears adequate to\\nafford an opportunity to those who are to be affected by such\\nrestraining order to appear in opposition to the application therefor,\\nif each of the following conditions is met:\\n  (a) There is a labor dispute which directly and immediately involves:\\n  (i) The production on a farm of milk, fruits, berries, vegetables or\\nother farm produce; or\\n  (ii) The shipment of any such product from the farm where it was\\nproduced; or\\n  (iii) The first storage of any such product after shipment from the\\nfarm where it was produced; or\\n  (iv) The first processing by canning or freezing of fruits, berries or\\nvegetables; and\\n  (b) The plaintiff is a producer of such product; and\\n  (c) Such product is in a perishable condition; and\\n  (d) The verified complaint and other testimony submitted by the\\nplaintiff, under oath, if sustained, would be sufficient not only to\\njustify the court in issuing a temporary injunction upon a hearing after\\nnotice in accordance with the provisions of this section, but also to\\nshow that the plaintiff will be irreparably damaged unless a restraining\\norder is issued; and\\n  (e) The court or judge, before issuing the restraining order, makes a\\ndecision to be filed in the record of the case in which he finds\\nspecifically that each of the facts called for by subdivision one above\\nof this section has been established prima facie by the weight of the\\nevidence submitted in support of the application for the restraining\\norder and in opposition thereto.\\n  Any such restraining order shall be effective for no longer than five\\ndays and shall become void and not be subject to renewal at the\\nexpiration of said five days.\\n  3. No temporary injunction or restraining order shall be issued except\\non condition that plaintiff shall first file a minimum undertaking of\\none thousand dollars. Where an injunction or restraining order is sought\\nagainst more than a single individual, the court on the hearing shall\\nmake a finding of the number of individuals sought to be enjoined and\\nthe undertaking shall be increased by the sum of twenty dollars for each\\nadditional member of a local or national body sought to be enjoined. The\\nmaximum undertaking which may be required shall not exceed ten thousand\\ndollars. The undertaking shall be sufficient to recompense those\\nenjoined for any loss, expense or damage caused by the improvident or\\nimproper issuance of such injunction, including all reasonable costs\\n(together with reasonable attorney's fees), and expense against the\\ngranting of any injunctive relief sought in the same proceeding and\\nsubsequently denied by the court. The undertaking herein mentioned shall\\nconstitute an agreement on the part of the plaintiff and the surety upon\\nwhich a judgment may be entered in the same action or proceeding against\\nsaid plaintiff and surety. The filing of the undertaking shall be deemed\\nan appearance by the surety for that purpose. But nothing herein\\ncontained shall deprive any party having a claim or cause of action\\nunder or upon such undertaking from electing to pursue his ordinary\\nremedy by suit at law or in equity.\\n  4. No injunctive relief shall be granted to any plaintiff who has\\nfailed to plead and prove compliance with all obligations imposed by law\\nwhich are involved in the labor dispute in question, or who has failed\\nto allege and prove that he has made every reasonable effort to settle\\nsuch dispute either by negotiation or with the aid of any machinery of\\nmediation or voluntary arbitration, provided for by law or contract\\nbetween the parties.\\n  5. No injunctive relief shall be granted except to prohibit such\\nspecific act or acts as may be expressly complained of in the complaint\\nand the bill of particulars filed in such case and expressly included in\\nthe findings of fact made and filed by the court. Such injunctive relief\\nshall be binding only upon the parties to the suit, their agents,\\nservants, employees, or those in active concert or participation with\\nthem and who shall by personal service or otherwise have received actual\\nnotice of the same.\\n  6. No officer or member of any association or organization, and no\\nassociation or organization participating or interested in a labor\\ndispute (as these terms are herein defined) shall be held responsible or\\nliable in any civil action at law or suit in equity, or in any criminal\\nprosecution, for the unlawful acts of individual officers, members, or\\nagents, except upon proof by the weight of evidence and without the aid\\nof any presumptions of law or fact, of (a) the doing of such acts by\\npersons who are officers, members or agents of any such association or\\norganization, and (b) actual participation in, or actual authorization\\nof, such acts, or ratification of such acts after actual knowledge\\nthereof by such association or organization.\\n  7. Every temporary injunction and restraining order shall by its terms\\nexpire within such time after entry as the court or judge may fix, not\\nto exceed ten days, unless the plaintiff is ready by the expiration of\\nthat period to proceed to trial and shall pay the necessary calendar and\\ntrial fees.\\n  8. No permanent injunction shall remain in force for more than six\\nmonths from the date on which the judgment is signed, provided, however,\\nthat the duration of the injunction may be extended for another six\\nmonths, if after a further hearing initiated and conducted in the same\\nmanner as the original hearing the court shall determine that the\\ninjunction shall be continued or modified in accordance with the\\nfindings of facts on the subsequent hearing.\\n  9. Whenever any court or judge or judges thereof shall issue or deny\\nany temporary injunction in a case involving or growing out of a labor\\ndispute the stenographer shall furnish to the clerk within ten days the\\noriginal transcript of the minutes after fees therefor have been paid.\\nImmediately upon receiving such minutes the clerk shall cause notice of\\nthat fact to be sent to the attorney for the appellant, or to the\\nappellant if he has not appeared by attorney. The appellant or his\\nattorney shall then procure the case to be settled on written notice of\\nat least three days to the clerk and to the attorney for the respondent\\nor to the respondent if he has not appeared by attorney, returnable\\nbefore the justice who tried the case. The clerk must thereupon make a\\nreturn to the appellate court, which must contain the summons,\\npleadings, evidence and judgment or final order and all other necessary\\npapers and proceedings and have annexed thereto the opinion of the\\ncourt, if any, and the notice of appeal. The justice before whom the\\ncase was tried shall within five days from the date of the submission to\\nhim of the case on appeal, settle the case and endorse his settlement on\\nthe return. The clerk must thereupon cause the return to be filed with\\nthe clerk of the appellate court. After a justice is out of office he\\nmay settle the case in any action or proceeding tried before him and may\\nbe compelled by the appellate court to do so. Upon the filing of such\\nrecord in the appropriate appellate court the appeal shall be heard with\\nthe greatest possible expedition, giving the proceeding precedence over\\nall other matters except older matters of the same character.\\n  10. When used in this section, and for the purpose of this section:\\n(a) A case shall be held to involve or to grow out of a labor dispute\\nwhen the case involves persons who are engaged in the same industry,\\ntrade, craft or occupation, or who are employees of one employer; or who\\nare members of the same or an affiliated organization of employers or\\nemployees; whether such dispute is between one or more employers or\\nassociations of employers and one or more employees or associations of\\nemployees; between one or more employers or associations of employers\\nand one or more employers or associations of employers; or between one\\nor more employees or associations of employees and one or more employees\\nor associations of employees; or when the case involves any conflicting\\nor competing interests in a \"labor dispute\" (as hereinafter defined) of\\n\"persons participating or interested\" therein (as hereinafter defined).\\n  (b) A person or association shall be held to be a person participating\\nor interested in a labor dispute if relief is sought against him or it\\nand if he or it is engaged in the industry, trade, craft or occupation\\nin which such dispute occurs, or is a member, officer or agent of any\\nassociation of employers or employees engaged in such industry, trade,\\ncraft or occupation.\\n  (c) The term \"labor dispute\" includes any controversy concerning terms\\nor conditions of employment, or concerning the association or\\nrepresentation of persons in negotiating, fixing, maintaining, changing\\nor seeking to arrange terms or conditions of employment, or concerning\\nemployment relations, or any other controversy arising out of the\\nrespective interests of employer and employee, regardless of whether or\\nnot the disputants stand in the relation of employer and employee.\\n",

The skills of many other persons who are\\ncurrently employed are being rendered obsolete by such dislocations in\\nthe economy. Unless such persons are given appropriate career and\\nrelated education and training, many of them and their families are\\ndoomed to lifelong unemployment or underemployment and dependency on the\\naid, care and support of the welfare agencies of the state and its\\npolitical subdivisions; with appropriate career and related education\\nand training; many of them would become qualified for occupational\\ncategories which remain unfilled because of shortages of qualified\\npersonnel.\\n  Accordingly, it is the purpose of this act to authorize the state\\ngovernment to develop programs of career and related education and\\ntraining which will permit persons who face the hazards of unemployment\\nand underemployment to develop skills which are useful in the\\ncontemporary economy and to assist such persons to participate in such\\nprograms.\\n",

The legislature finds\\nthat due to the state's continuing loss of business and industry,\\ndeclining economy and its resultant excessively high net job loss it is\\nnecessary and appropriate to take new and aggressive steps to promote\\nand keep business, industry and jobs within the state of New York and it\\nis therefore in the public interest of the state of New York to create a\\nmechanism to permit the governor of the state of New York, under\\nextraordinary circumstances, subject to provisions of this article, to\\naward a state contract to a New York state resident business bidder over\\na non-resident New York state bidder with a lower submitted bid upon a\\nfinding that such award is in the public interest of the state of New\\nYork. The legislature also finds that increased costs incurred by the\\nstate from the award of the state contract to other than the lowest\\nbidder will be offset by the benefits of continued and/or additional\\nstate and local government tax revenues generated by continued and/or\\nincreased employment within the state, and continued and/or additional\\ntax revenues from such additional business being generated within this\\nstate.\\n  It is therefore the intent of this article to create and provide the\\ngovernor of the state of New York with a mechanism for granting a\\npreference in the letting of state contracts to New York state resident\\nbidders, who have substantial economic ties with New York state, and who\\ncontribute to the state's economy where sufficient offsetting benefits\\nwould be realized by New York state in terms of state employment and\\ngeneration of state and local tax revenues, through the exercise of this\\nmechanism.\\n  * NB Expired July 1, 1979\\n",

In addition, there has been an explosion of\\nemployers who operate in the underground economy and fail to report all\\nor a sizable portion of their workers.\\n  The legislature hereby finds and declares that recent studies of New\\nYork city's construction industry alone suggests that as many as fifty\\nthousand New York city construction workers -- nearly one in four -- are\\neither misclassified as independent contractors or are employed by\\nconstruction contractors completely off the books. Construction industry\\nfraud reduces government revenue, shifts tax and workers' compensation\\ninsurance costs to law-abiding employees, lowers working conditions and\\nsteals jobs from legitimate employers and their employees.\\n  Therefore, the legislature hereby finds and declares that government\\nhas an obligation to curb this underground economy, enforce\\nlong-standing employment laws, ensure compliance with essential social\\ninsurance protections and eliminate the unfair competitive advantage\\nfrom contractors in the underground economy by and through the enactment\\nof the New York state construction industry fair play act.\\n",

Before a permit may be issued as provided in\\nsection eight hundred seventy-d of this article, an inspection of the\\namusement device, viewing stand or tent shall be made in compliance with\\nthe procedures set by the commissioner. Such inspection shall have been\\nconducted within one year prior to the permit application, unless such\\nperiod shall have been extended by operation of subdivision four of this\\nsection.\\n  1. In the case of a permanent device, viewing stand or tent, the\\namusement device, viewing stand or tent must be inspected by the\\ncommissioner or his authorized representative, or in the city of New\\nYork, by the building department, at the time of application for the\\ninitial permit. In the case of an amusement device deemed by the\\ncommissioner to normally be operated at speeds or with movements\\ncreating severe centrifugal forces, the owner or operator making the\\npermit application for such device shall have available for inspection\\nsuch recommended maintenance and safety schedules or requirements as are\\nsupplied by the manufacturer of the device. An initial operating permit\\nshall not be granted in the absence of these documents. Thereafter, the\\namusement device, viewing stand or tent must be inspected at least\\nannually by a licensed architect, professional engineer, qualified\\ninspector of an insurance underwriter, or an inspector approved by the\\ncommissioner as a requirement for the issuance of each subsequent\\npermit. Such inspection shall at minimum comply with the requirements of\\nthe commissioner, provided that for amusement devices, at the time of\\neach such annual inspection, the owner or operator of such device shall\\nhave available for inspection such recommended maintenance and safety\\nschedules or requirements as are supplied by the manufacturer of the\\ndevice and shall have available documentation that such maintenance and\\ntesting as are called for by the device manufacturer have been performed\\nduring the term covered by the previous operating permit. No subsequent\\noperating permit shall be granted in the absence of these documents. An\\naffidavit of the annual inspection shall be filed with the commissioner.\\n  2. In the case of a temporary device, viewing stand or tent, upon\\nfirst entry into the state, the amusement device, viewing stand or tent\\nmust be inspected by the commissioner or his authorized representative\\nfor the permit to be issued. In the case of a temporary amusement device\\ndeemed by the commissioner to normally operate at speeds or with\\nmovements creating severe centrifugal forces the owner or operator\\nmaking the permit application for such device shall have available for\\ninspection such recommended maintenance and safety schedules or\\nrequirements as are supplied by the manufacturer of the device. An\\noperating permit shall not be granted in the absence of these documents.\\nThereafter, the amusement device, viewing stand or tent must be\\ninspected at least annually by a licensed architect, professional\\nengineer, qualified inspector of an insurance underwriter, or an\\ninspector approved by the commissioner as a requirement for the issuance\\nof each subsequent permit. Such inspection shall at minimum comply with\\nthe requirements of the commissioner, provided that for amusement\\ndevices, at the time of each such annual inspection, the owner or\\noperator of such device shall have available for inspection such\\nrecommended maintenance and safety schedules or requirements as are\\nsupplied by the manufacturer of the device and shall have available\\ndocumentation that such maintenance and testing as are called for by the\\ndevice manufacturer have been performed during the term covered by the\\nprevious operating permit. No subsequent operating permit shall be\\ngranted in the absence of these documents. An affidavit of the annual\\ninspection shall be filed with the commissioner.\\n  2-a. Where such maintenance and safety schedules as are called for in\\nsubdivisions one and two of this section do not exist or are not\\navailable due to circumstances beyond the control of the owner or\\noperator of an amusement device, the owner or operator shall, within six\\nmonths of the discovery of the unavailability of such standards, submit\\nto the commissioner a proposed schedule of maintenance for that\\namusement device consistent with the standards for the testing and\\nmaintenance of such devices established in accordance with the rules and\\nregulations promulgated pursuant to subdivision six of this section and\\nshall henceforth be the schedule with which the owner or operator must\\ncomply to qualify for annual operating permits.\\n  2-b. None of the provisions contained in subdivision two-a of this\\nsection shall be interpreted as to prevent the owner or operator of an\\namusement device from receiving an annual permit to operate such device\\nduring the proposed maintenance schedule submission process described in\\nsuch subdivision provided that such owner or operator meets all the\\nrequirements for an annual operating permit as they exist prior to the\\neffective date of this subdivision.\\n  2-c. The owner or operator of an amusement device shall conspicuously\\npost a sign containing safety guidelines to be followed by patrons while\\non or in the amusement device and behavior or activities which are\\nprohibited as threats either to the patrons themselves, other patrons or\\nthe general public. Such signs shall contain warnings that there are\\ninherent risks in the participation in or on the amusement device, since\\nit is recognized that participation in or on the device may be hazardous\\nregardless of all feasible safety measures that can be undertaken by the\\ndevice owner or operator; and that there is a duty for the patrons to\\nbecome apprised of the warnings and the risks inherent in participation\\nin or on the amusement device if the warnings are not obeyed. Prior to\\nparticipating in or on such amusement device, patrons shall familiarize\\nthemselves with the posted safety warnings so that they may make an\\ninformed decision of whether to participate in or on the device\\nnotwithstanding the risks.\\n  3. In the case of an amusement device, viewing stand or tent which is\\nsubstantially rebuilt or substantially modified so as to change the\\nstructure, mechanism, or capacity of the device, viewing stand or tent,\\nthe owner or lessee shall give written notice to the commissioner who\\nshall cause the device, viewing stand or tent to be inspected prior to\\nthe time in which it is put into operation and who shall cause any\\ncurrent permit to be updated so as to include any modifications made to\\nthe device, viewing stand or tent.\\n  4. In the event an operator is unable to secure an inspection by his\\ninsurance carrier within one year from the date of the previous\\ninspection, such previous inspection shall be deemed valid for purposes\\nof this article for a period of thirty additional days, provided such\\noperator made an inspection request to his insurance carrier at least\\nsixty days prior to the inspection anniversary date.\\n  5. No amusement device, viewing stand or tent which fails to pass an\\ninspection shall be operated for public use until it has passed a\\nsubsequent inspection.\\n  6. The commissioner shall, in consultation with the carnival, fair and\\namusement park safety advisory board as established under section eight\\nhundred seventy-n of this article, as added by a chapter of the laws of\\ntwo thousand six, establish rules and regulations providing standards\\nfor the design, manufacture, testing, inspection, quality assurance and\\nterminology of amusement devices.

Improper design,\\nimplementation or inspection of asbestos projects creates unnecessary\\nhealth and safety hazards which are detrimental to the state's interest,\\nand that of its citizens.\\n  The legislature, therefore, finds and declares it to be its purpose\\nand policy to reduce asbestos related hazards by encouraging proper\\ntraining of persons employed to design, implement or inspect asbestos\\nprojects and those who supervise or employ them, by requiring the\\nlicensing of contractors and the certification of individuals involved\\nin asbestos projects pursuant to regulations promulgated by the\\ncommissioner, prior to the removal, enclosure, encapsulation or\\ndisturbance of friable asbestos or any handling of asbestos material\\nwhich may result in the release of asbestos fiber and by conferring upon\\nthe commissioner the authority to inspect ongoing asbestos projects and\\npromulgate and enforce safety and health standards regulating the\\nconduct of those projects through injunctions, and the imposition of\\ncivil and criminal penalties.\\n",
