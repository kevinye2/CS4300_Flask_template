Subject to the limitations hereinafter set\\nforth, the New York city transit authority, successor to the board of\\ntransportation of the city of New York under title fifteen of article\\nseven of the public authorities law and hereinafter referred to as the\\nauthority, shall grant to every employee under its supervision, other\\nthan a member of the uniformed force of the New York city transit\\npolice, who shall have been in its employ for at least one year, sick\\nleave with pay on each working day when he is unfit for work on account\\nof illness, up to a total, in any one year, of twelve days plus the\\nnumber of days, not exceeding eighty-four, by which the total amount of\\nsick leave with pay allowed to such employee by the board of\\ntransportation and the authority in prior years since the thirtieth day\\nof April, nineteen hundred forty-one, shall have been less than one day\\nper month of employment during such prior years, but in no event shall\\nthe authority be required to allow any employee sick leave with pay for\\nmore than a total of ninety-six working days in any one year. To every\\nemployee in its employ less than one year, the authority, subject to the\\nlimitations herein set forth, shall grant sick leave with pay on each\\nworking day when such employee is unfit for work on account of illness,\\nup to a total of one day for each calendar month during which, or the\\nmajor part of which, the employee shall have been in such employ. The\\nterm \"year\", as used in this section, shall mean a period of twelve\\nmonths beginning on the first day of May and ending on the following\\nthirtieth day of April. For the purpose of this section an employee\\nshall not be deemed to have been in the employ of the board of\\ntransportation or the authority during a period of leave of absence\\nwithout pay excepting where such leave of absence is for ordered\\nmilitary duty. For any day on which sick leave with pay is required by\\nthis section to be granted to an employee, the pay to be allowed him\\nshall be the same as if he had worked in accordance with his regular\\nwork schedule on that particular day. Sick leave with pay shall not run\\nconcurrently with any vacation.\\n  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this section, the\\nauthority shall not be required to pay an employee for the first working\\nday in any period of leave of absence for illness unless such leave of\\nabsence shall reach a total of nine or more consecutive working days, in\\nwhich event the employee shall receive pay for the total leave up to the\\nallowable limit.\\n  2. The authority may grant to a member of the uniformed force of the\\nNew York city transit police, who shall have been in its employ for at\\nleast six months, sick leave with pay at the rate of one-half of his\\nrate of pay for the first three working days of illness and full pay on\\nand after the fourth consecutive working day on which he is unfit for\\nwork on account of illness, until such illness shall have continued for\\none year. If such member of the uniformed force of the New York city\\ntransit police shall become temporarily disabled for performance of duty\\nas a natural and proximate result of service as such member, he may be\\ngranted sick leave with full pay from the date of such disability until\\nhe recovers therefrom and is restored to duty. In the event the\\nauthority determines not to grant to members of the uniformed force of\\nthe New York city transit police the sick leave benefits contemplated in\\nthis subdivision, or having granted such sick leave benefits\\ndiscontinues such benefits, then such members shall be considered\\nemployees of the transit authority subject to the provisions of\\nsubdivision one of this section, notwithstanding the exception as to\\nsuch members set forth in subdivision one hereof.\\n  3.

The authority may require that an employee\\nsubmit satisfactory medical evidence of illness and further the\\nauthority may require that an employee submit to physical examination by\\na physician employed by the authority, provided such physical\\nexamination is without charge or loss of compensation to said employee,\\nas a condition of the granting of sick leave with pay. The authority may\\ngrant sick leave with pay to any employee for a period of time beyond\\nthat required by this section if, after a physical examination by a\\nphysician employed by the authority, and in the opinion and judgment of\\nsuch authority, the duties, position or length of service of the\\nemployee, or other circumstances surrounding his employment, warrant\\nsuch additional sick leave with pay.\\n",

This section shall be deemed to apply also to\\nany such actions instituted before May sixth, nineteen hundred\\ntwenty-one. If bonds are issued by the city for the purposes of this\\nsection they may be made payable out of a sinking fund to be established\\nand created out of the annual rentals or revenues of such road,\\nincluding sub-surface structures, as provided in this chapter. In case\\nthe board shall request the mayor to have any part of the work of\\nrestoration of street surfaces or property incidental to the\\nconstruction of any such road performed by or under the direction of any\\nhead of an agency of such city or any subdivision of such city, the\\nmayor may set apart out of any appropriation theretofore made under the\\nforegoing provisions of this section such amount as the board of\\ntransportation may specify and shall make such amount available for the\\nuse of such head of such agency for the purposes of such restoration of\\nstreet surfaces or property.\\n  b.

An assessment upon\\nthe property so benefited may be laid, confirmed, enforced and collected\\nin accordance with such determination and pursuant to the provisions of\\nthe charter, administrative code of such city and other laws respecting\\nassessments for local improvements in such city.\\n  d.

Such decision of the\\nboard of transportation so approved by the board of estimate and the\\nmayor, shall be final as to each matter so fixed and determined and\\nshall not be subject to review.\\n  e. The board of estimate, with the approval of the mayor, shall\\ncertify to the board of assessors of such city the amount of such cost\\nand expense so directed to be assessed upon property benefited in each\\nsuch district. Such board of assessors shall thereupon proceed forthwith\\nto levy and assess such amount upon the real property within the\\ndistrict benefited thereby in proportion to the amount of such benefit\\nand shall not be limited in the levying of such assessment to one-half\\nof the fair value of any house or lot or improved or unimproved land.\\nSuch assessment when laid shall be subject to, and protected by, all\\nprovisions of the charter and administrative code of such city\\napplicable to assessments for local improvements levied pursuant to such\\ncharter and code.\\n  f. An assessment levied against any property in accordance with this\\nsection shall be payable as follows, namely: one-tenth thereof within\\nsixty days from the date of the confirmation and entry of each\\nassessment and the remainder of such assessment in nine installments as\\nnearly equal in amount as may be with interest thereon from the date of\\nentry and confirmation at the rate of six per centum per annum in one,\\ntwo, three, four, five, six, seven, eight and nine years respectively\\nthereafter, but all installments not due may be paid at any time with\\ninterest to the date of payment. If any installment and interest thereon\\nbe not paid within three years after it shall become due and payable the\\nentire assessment less such part thereof as shall have been already\\npaid, shall become due and payable and must be immediately collected, or\\nthe tax lien therefor sold or enforced in the same manner as other\\ndelinquent assessments are required to be collected by the charter,\\nadministrative code and other laws of such city.\\n  g. Obligations of the city issued in advance of the collection of such\\nassessments shall be payable out of the rapid transit construction fund\\nas hereinafter directed to be constituted. They shall be a legal\\ninvestment for the sinking funds of such city and for trustees and other\\nfiduciaries charged with the investment of trust funds.\\n  h. All moneys derived from the sale of such obligations, and all\\nmoneys derived from the collection of such assessments shall be kept\\nseparate and apart from all other funds of the city and shall be known\\nas the rapid transit construction fund of such railroad. Unless the\\nassessment be made separately for the cost and expense of acquisition of\\nproperty as aforesaid, they shall be applied only to the following uses\\nand, among such uses, only in the following order as nearly as may be:\\n  1. To the cost and expenses of the construction of such railroad and\\nthe acquisition of property necessary for such construction, including\\nequipment other than rolling stock;\\n  2. To the acquisition of real property necessary for the operation\\nthereof;\\n  3. To the retirement of the obligations therefor.\\n  In case an assessment is made separately for the cost and expense\\nincurred or to be incurred for the acquisition of any property for the\\nconstruction or operation of any such railroad, the money derived from\\nthe sale of such obligations, and all moneys derived from the collection\\nof such assessment shall be applied only to pay or reimburse the cost\\nand expense of acquisition of the property for which such assessment was\\nmade or to the retirement of the obligations issued in advance of the\\ncollection of such assessment.\\n  i. In case of default in the payment of any installment of interest or\\nprincipal of any such obligations the holder thereof may require, if\\nnecessary, by peremptory order of mandamus, any tax lien of such city\\nfor the amount of any assessment upon the property benefited which is\\nthen due and payable, to be immediately sold or enforced in accordance\\nwith the charter, administrative code and other laws of such city. If at\\nsuch time the tax lien so sold shall include, in addition to the lien of\\nthe assessment aforesaid, any lien for delinquent taxes or other\\nlienable charges due to the city, and if it shall become necessary to\\nreduce the amount of the tax lien pursuant to such charter, code and\\nlaws of such city, the lien shall not be reduced so as to make it less\\nin value than the amount of the assessment aforesaid with the interest\\nthereon. Notwithstanding any reduction as aforesaid, the proceeds of the\\nsale of such a lien, to the extent of the full amount of the assessment\\nand interest, shall be paid into the rapid transit construction fund of\\nthe railroad aforesaid, and the balance, if any, shall be applied as\\nproceeds of the rest of the tax lien.\\n  j. If any assessment shall be reduced for fraud, substantial error or\\nother reason, the cost and expense aforesaid may be reassessed, and the\\nreassessment shall stand as security for the obligations aforesaid to\\nthe same degree and in the same manner as if it had been an original\\nassessment. In case any assessment is reduced below its original amount,\\nhowever, either the amount to be expended in constructing the railroad\\naforesaid and for acquisition of property necessary for construction and\\noperation thereof as aforesaid, or to be expended for acquisition of\\nproperty, if the assessment reduced is for cost and expense thereof\\nseparately, shall be correspondingly reduced or else the difference\\nbetween the original assessment and the reassessment shall be paid by\\nthe city into the rapid transit construction fund of the railroad\\naforesaid, either from current revenue or from sums to be made available\\nas the board of estimate shall determine.\\n  k. If the cost and expenses of construction of any such railroad and\\nfor acquisition of property necessary for construction and operation\\nthereof as aforesaid shall be only partially assessed as aforesaid upon\\nthe property benefited, no provisions in any contract for the\\nconstruction thereof shall become operative until the board of estimate\\nand the mayor shall have consented thereto and shall have prescribed a\\nlimit to the amount of city funds if any, available for the purpose of\\nsuch contract as hereinbefore provided. No provisions in any contract\\nfor the construction of any railroad which construction is to be paid\\nfor wholly or partly by means of local assessments shall become\\noperative until the board of estimate shall have levied an assessment to\\nprovide for the construction thereof, and until either assessments shall\\nhave been paid in, or obligations issued in advance of the collection of\\nsuch assessments, shall have been sold in sufficient amounts when paid\\nfor, to cover the cost and expense payable from assessments levied as\\naforesaid and until the board of estimate and the mayor shall have\\nconsented to such a contract.\\n  l. In a case where the moneys collected pursuant to such an assessment\\nshall be insufficient to discharge the obligations so issued as\\naforesaid, or if the amount arising on the sale of such obligations is\\ninsufficient to pay the expenses incurred for the construction of such\\nrailroad and for acquisition of property necessary for construction and\\noperation thereof as aforesaid, or incurred for acquisition of property,\\nif the assessment is for cost and expense thereof separately, the\\ndeficiency up to an amount not in excess of ten per centum of the total\\namount of the assessment shall be paid by such city into the rapid\\ntransit construction fund, either from current revenue or from sums made\\navailable as the board of estimate and the mayor shall determine.\\n",

The board of transportation shall establish and maintain a system\\nof accounts to show at all times the cost of the several classes of\\nproperty used in operation and the sources of funds used in the\\nacquisition of such property; the several classes of operating revenue\\nand other income; maintenance expenses; interest, amortization,\\ndepreciation and all other charges against earnings. Such accounts shall\\nbe kept in accordance with the uniform system of accounts prescribed for\\nrailroads by the public service commission or other duly constituted\\nauthority and published in the City Record.\\n  c.

Operating expenses, exclusive of maintenance, including all\\nexpenses for personal service, materials and supplies used in operation.\\n  2.

The contract shall\\nin such case provide for adjustment between the city and the corporation\\nof the difference in the value of the right to operate the lines or\\nportions thereof so exchanged by agreement or arbitration or by the\\ncourt and for payment of such difference between them. The city and the\\ncorporation, in such contract, may also provide that if the city, under\\nany provision of law, shall terminate the contract for the maintenance\\nand operation of such road of the city after the expiration of ten years\\nfrom the date when operation of any part of such road shall actually\\nbegin, the city, at any time after thirty-five years from such date, may\\nterminate such contract for the maintenance and operation of the\\nrailroad theretofore constructed at the public expense, and take over\\nany such railroad upon payment to such company of a sum not exceeding\\nthe then present worth of the unexpired portion of the term of such\\ncontract to be ascertained as provided in such contract, which may\\nprovide that in default of agreement such sum may be determined by\\narbitration or by the court.\\n  e. The contract between the city and such corporation may also provide\\nthat in consideration of the operation of any such railroad as provided\\nfor in such contract and any such railroad theretofore constructed in\\nwhole or in part at public expense in connection with each other for a\\nsingle fare, and of the payment by such company of moneys to be applied\\nas authorized by this chapter to or toward the construction by the city\\nof the road to be maintained and operated under such contract. In\\nfurther consideration of any covenants or agreements by the company to\\nmodify the term of any of its leases or to waive or modify any of the\\nother provisions of any of its contracts, the gross receipts of the\\noperation of any such railroad theretofore constructed and of such road\\nof the city to be maintained and operated under such contract may be\\ncombined during the term of such contract, and that the city shall\\nreceive for the use of such additional road at intervals named a\\nspecified part or proportion of the income, earnings or profits of the\\nrailroads whose receipts are so combined. In such case the contract may\\napportion out of the amount so to be received by the city and specify a\\nportion thereof which shall be deemed to be the rental for the use of\\neach of the roads of the city maintained, equipped and operated under\\nsuch contract.

A sum not exceeding six per centum per annum for each year upon the\\ninvestment of such company, including brokerage charges not exceeding\\nthree per centum, in the construction and equipment of such road of the\\ncity to be maintained and operated under such contract; and\\n  3. A sum not exceeding the annual expense or cost to the contractor\\nplus one per centum per annum on account of the investment of the\\ncontractor in betterments or improvements upon or additions to such road\\nand equipment.\\nSuch contract may also provide that such annual payments shall be\\ncumulative, and that any deficiency with respect thereto shall be paid\\noff and discharged annually out of such gross receipts before any\\npayments by way of rental or compensation for the use of such roads\\nshall be made to the city.\\n f. Every such contract shall contain such terms and conditions as to\\nthe rates of fare to be charged and the character of services to be\\nfurnished and otherwise as the board of transportation shall deem to be\\nbest suited to the public interests, and subject to such public\\nsupervision and to such conditions, regulations and requirements as may\\nbe determined upon by such board, with like approval. In case different\\nparts of a road shall be constructed at different times or at intervals\\nof time, or if the contract shall provide for the use by the contractor\\nof an existing railroad as part of a continuous route as aforesaid, then\\nand in any such case the board of transportation, in its discretion, may\\nprescribe periods for the operation of the different parts of such road\\nso that at one period of time in the future the board may be enabled to\\nmake a single operating contract or lease of the entire road. Such\\nboard, in its discretion, as one of the terms and conditions of any such\\ncontract, may provide that as a consideration for the making of such\\ncontract the contractor in addition to any sums to be paid as provided\\nby this chapter by way of rental or otherwise for the use of such road\\nshall contribute a part of the cost of construction of such road which\\nshall be contributed and disbursed by such method, in such manner and at\\nsuch times as may be provided for in any such contract. Such\\ncontribution shall be deemed to be an investment by the contractor in\\nthe construction of such road or to be part of the cost to the\\ncontractor of constructing such road within the meaning of subdivision a\\nof this section providing for termination of such contract by the city.\\nAny such contract may provide for the construction during the term of\\nsuch contract of any branches or extensions of such road and the\\nconstruction of additional lines and for the equipment and operation\\nthereof by the contractor in connection with such road and may make\\nseparate provision for apportioning the receipts of such road and of\\nsuch branches, extensions or additional lines and as to the compensation\\nto be paid to the city for the use of any such branches, extensions or\\nadditional lines. The city may enter into a contract for the equipment,\\nmaintenance and operation of any such road before any contract for\\nconstruction of such road or any portion thereof shall have been made,\\nand in such case the contract may provide that the city may construct or\\ncomplete such road or additions thereto or betterments thereof from time\\nto time at the expense of the city, or partly at the expense of the city\\nand partly at the cost or through contribution of the contractor as\\naforesaid in such proportion as may be agreed upon between the city and\\nthe contractor. Such contract for the equipment, maintenance and\\noperation of such road or any portion thereof may be made and entered\\ninto as provided in this chapter before the consents shall have been\\nobtained for any such road or for any portion thereof as provided in\\nsection twenty-one of this chapter, and before the detailed plans and\\nspecifications shall have been prepared as provided in section\\ntwenty-two of this chapter. In such case such contract for equipment,\\nmaintenance and operation of such road or any portion thereof shall be\\nupon condition that such contract shall not become operative or go into\\neffect as to such road or such portion thereof unless and until the city\\nshall acquire the right to construct such road or portion thereof by\\nobtaining such consents.  The board of transportation in any contract\\nmay reserve the right, upon conditions and for compensation to the\\ncontractor, as provided in the contract, to permit other persons and the\\nmunicipality itself to use the tracks, structure and line equipment of\\nthe railroad, or any portions thereof.\\n  g. Every such contract shall further provide that the person so\\ncontracting to equip, maintain and operate such road annually or at\\nspecified intervals, shall pay into the treasury of such city, such\\nrental for the use of such road, as shall be prescribed therein. The\\nrental may be either a specified sum of money or a specified part or\\nproportion of income, earnings or profits of such road, or both a sum of\\nmoney and a part or proportion of income, earnings or profits, as such\\nboard shall deem best suited to the public interest and the board of\\nestimate and the mayor shall approve. Every such contract may further\\nprovide that the amount and character of such rental may be readjusted\\nat the expiration of a prescribed period of not more than twenty years,\\nand be readjusted from time to time in the future at intervals each of\\nnot more than twenty years, and may prescribe a method of determining by\\narbitration or by the court the amount to be paid upon any readjustment\\nthereof. If such contract be made with a person owning or actually\\noperating or agreeing to operate a railroad wholly or in part within the\\nlimits of the city and shall make provision for the equipment,\\nmaintenance and operation of such road of the city in connection with\\nsuch railroad and for a single fare, the contract may provide that the\\ngross receipts from the operation of such railroad within the limits of\\nthe city and from the operation of such road of the city may be combined\\nduring the term of such contract and that the city shall receive for the\\nuse of such road at intervals named a specified part or proportion of\\nthe income, earnings or profits of the railroads whose receipts are so\\ncombined and the contract, in such case, may apportion out of the amount\\nso to be received by the city and specify a portion thereof which shall\\nbe deemed to be the rental for the use of each of the roads of the city\\nmaintained, equipped and operated under such contract. In any such case\\nthe contract shall provide for determining the amount of the income,\\nearnings or profits of the railroads whose gross earnings are so\\ncombined, and may authorize the retention, prior to the payment of any\\nsums to the city for or on account of the investment of the city in the\\nconstruction of such road or for the use of the same, of:\\n  1. A specified sum of money, which may represent the average annual\\nincome from operation of such railroad theretofore constructed during a\\nperiod specified in such contract;\\n  2. A sum not exceeding six per centum per annum for each year upon the\\ninvestment of the contractor, including brokerage charges not exceeding\\nthree per centum, in the construction and equipment of such road of the\\ncity to be maintained and operated under such contract, and in the\\nconstruction and equipment of extensions of any railroads and tracks not\\nowned by the city thereafter constructed and to be operated under such\\ncontract; and\\n  3. A sum not exceeding the annual expense or cost to the contractor,\\nplus one per centum per annum, on account of the investment of the\\ncontractor in betterments or improvements upon, or additions to such\\nroad of the city, and upon or to any railroads not owned by the city and\\noperated under such contract, and upon or to the equipment thereof.\\n  Such contract may also provide that such payments shall be cumulative,\\nand that any deficiency with respect thereto shall be paid off and\\ndischarged annually out of such gross receipts before any payments by\\nway of rental or compensation for the use of such roads shall be made to\\nthe city. The contract may provide for a readjustment at specified\\nintervals of the part or proportion of such income, earnings or profits\\nof the railroads, which the city shall receive, or of the portion of the\\namount received by the city which shall be deemed to be the rental of\\neach such road owned by the city, and may prescribe a method of\\ndetermining by arbitration or by the court the amount which the city\\nshall receive as its part or proportion of such income, earnings or\\nprofits or as such rental upon any such readjustment thereof.\\n  h. Such rental and the term for the operation of the railroad included\\nin any such contract shall begin, as to such road, or any section\\nthereof, at such time as may be provided in the contract. The aforesaid\\nrental shall be paid at such times during each year or at such intervals\\nas the board of transportation shall require. If a contract to equip,\\nmaintain and operate such road be made with the person having or to have\\nthe contract to construct the same and such contract shall provide that\\nsuch road shall be constructed wholly or in part at the cost of such\\nperson such road, however, to be the property of the city in the same\\nmanner and to the same extent as if constructed wholly with public\\nmoney, then the contract may provide as an alternative in lieu of the\\nrental above provided for that any and all income and increase derived\\nby the contractor or on his behalf in any manner from the enterprise of\\nconstructing, equipping, maintaining and operating such road, after\\ndeducting operating expenses, taxes, payments to reserve and\\namortization funds as provided for in the contract, and not exceeding\\nsix per centum interest per annum payable quarterly upon the actual cost\\nto the contractor of construction and equipment of such road, shall be\\ndivided share and share alike between the contractor and the city. The\\nrental and any sums payable under such contract, except any sum of money\\nthat may be contributed toward the construction of any road by the\\ncontractor having the contract for the equipment and operation of such\\nroad, shall be applied first to the payment of the interest upon\\nobligations issued by such city for the construction and equipment of\\nsuch road, as the same shall accrue and fall due. The remainder of such\\nrental and moneys not required for the payment of such interest shall be\\nkept separate and apart from any and all other moneys of such city and\\nshall be securely invested and, with the annual accretions of interest\\nthereon, shall constitute a sinking fund for the payment and redemption\\nat maturity of the aforesaid obligations. Such rental, moneys and\\naccumulations of such fund over and above so much as may be required for\\npayment of interest and principal of such obligations, shall be paid\\ninto the rapid transit fund provided in section thirty-four of this\\nchapter.\\n  i. Any such contract also may provide for a renewal or renewals not to\\nexceed twenty years in the aggregate of the lease of such road upon the\\nexpiration of an original term of not more than twenty years upon such\\nterms and conditions, to be approved by the board of estimate and the\\nmayor, as to the board of transportation may seem just and proper.  Such\\ncontract also may contain provisions for the valuation of the whole or a\\npart of the property of such contractor employed in and about the\\nequipment, maintenance and operation of such road, and for the purchase\\nthereof by the city, at such valuation, or a percentage thereof, should\\nsuch lease not be so renewed at any time, or should it be terminated or\\nexpire as aforesaid. Such contract also shall state the date on which\\nthe operation of the road, or any section thereof, shall commence.\\n  j. In case the title to the equipment of such road shall not be vested\\nin the city, the city also shall have a first lien upon the rolling\\nstock and other property of such contractor, constituting the equipment\\nof such road and used or intended for use in the maintenance and\\noperation thereof, as further security for the faithful performance by\\nsuch contractor of the covenants, conditions and agreements of such\\ncontract, on his part to be fulfilled and performed. In case of the\\nbreach of any such covenant, condition and agreement such lien shall be\\nsubject to foreclosure by action, at the suit of such city, in the same\\nmanner, as far as may be, as is then provided by law in the case of\\nforeclosure by action of mortgages on real estate. The board of\\ntransportation, however, from time to time, may relieve from such lien\\nany of the property to which it may attach, upon receiving additional\\nsecurity, which may be deemed by such board to be the equivalent of that\\nwhich it is proposed to release and otherwise upon such terms as to such\\nboard shall seem just.\\n  k. The contract shall further provide that in case of the failure or\\nneglect on the part of such contractor, after such notice as the\\ncontract may prescribe, faithfully to observe, keep and fulfill the\\nconditions, obligations and requirements of such contract, the city, by\\nthe board of transportation, may either terminate the contract or take\\npossession of such road and the equipment thereof, and as the agent of\\nsuch contractor, either maintain and operate such road, or enter into a\\ncontract with some other person, for the maintenance and operation\\nthereof. Such contract shall contain such terms, conditions and\\nprovisions in relation thereto as such board shall deem necessary or\\ndesirable for adequately safeguarding and protecting the rights and\\ninterests of the city. Such contract shall also contain appropriate\\nterms, conditions and provisions for accomplishing such termination or\\ntaking possession.\\n  l. Any existing railroad corporation owning or actually operating a\\nrailroad wholly or in part within the limits of the city and approved by\\nthe board of transportation, shall be competent and is hereby authorized\\nto enter into any contract for the equipment, maintenance and operation\\nof any railroad pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, or, after\\nsuch a contract shall have been made, shall be competent and is hereby\\nauthorized, with the approval of such board, to contract with the\\noriginal contractor or his assignee or assignees for the maintenance and\\noperation (including the equipment or any part thereof) of any railroad\\nconstructed or in process of construction or to be constructed pursuant\\nto the provisions of this chapter, and shall have all the powers\\nnecessary to the due performance of such contract. A corporation may be\\norganized under the railroad law, for the purpose of constructing,\\nequipping, maintaining and operating a railroad pursuant to the\\nprovisions of this chapter or for the purpose of maintaining and\\noperating a railroad, including the equipment or any part thereof,\\nalready constructed, in process of construction or to be constructed\\npursuant to the provisions of this chapter. Any corporation so\\norganized, upon the approval in writing of the board of transportation,\\nin addition to the powers conferred by the general act under which such\\ncorporation is organized, shall be empowered, and is hereby authorized\\nto enter into any contract permitted by law for the maintenance and\\noperation when constructed, including the equipment or any part thereof\\nif desired, as the case may be, of any such railroad owned or to be\\nowned by the city, constructed or to be constructed at the expense of\\nthe city or of such corporation or both as provided by this chapter. The\\ncertificate of such approval shall be filed in the office of the\\nsecretary of state, and a copy thereof certified to be a true copy by\\nthe secretary of state or his deputy, shall be evidence of the fact\\ntherein stated.  A corporation so organized shall not be required to\\nprocure the consent of the public service commission as provided for in\\nsection nine of the railroad law.\\n  m. Where in this section or in section thirty-one of this chapter the\\nconsents referred to in section twenty-one of this chapter are\\nmentioned, they shall be construed to include any consent given by the\\ncommissioners appointed by the appellate division of the supreme court,\\nand confirmed by such appellate division in lieu of the consent of\\nproperty owners as provided in this section.\\n",

Any such city also may\\nexercise any of the rights to acquire such property rights upon the\\nvalidation of a route in the manner prescribed in sections twenty and\\ntwenty-one of this chapter, provided that if any such right shall be so\\nexercised prior to the time a contract for construction or operation of\\nsuch route shall be entered into, the board of estimate and the mayor,\\nas a condition precedent, shall approve such acquisition. An option\\ngranted to the board of transportation or to the city to purchase any\\nproperty rights or an award in a condemnation proceeding for a period\\nnot to exceed ninety days in case of purchase of property rights, and\\nfor a period not to exceed six months in case of purchase of such an\\naward shall not be withdrawn or cancelled during the period therein\\nnamed. Upon the trial of a condemnation proceeding on behalf of the\\nboard of transportation under the provisions of this chapter, no\\nevidence shall be admitted, as against an owner of an offer made by or\\non behalf of such owner for the sale of his real estate or any part\\nthereof to such board for or on behalf of such city, or for the sale or\\nassignment of any right and title to an award, or any part thereof, to\\nbe made for such real estate, or any part thereof, in the proceeding;\\nnor shall any evidence be received, as against such city, of any offer\\nmade to such owner by the board for or on behalf of the city for the\\npurchase of such real estate, or any part thereof, or for the purchase\\nof any award or any part thereof, to be made for such real estate, or\\nany part thereof, in the proceeding.\\n  b. Where any contractor for the construction or operation of such\\nrailroad shall require any property for such construction and operation,\\nsuch property shall be deemed to be required for a public purpose; and\\nwith the approval of the board of transportation such property may be\\nacquired by such contractor in all respects as such property may be\\nacquired by such board for the city. All proceedings to acquire such\\nproperty shall be conducted under the direction and subject to the\\napproval of such board. It shall be the duty of the board whenever any\\nproperty which the city shall have acquired as provided in this chapter\\nshall be unnecessary for rapid transit purposes, to surrender the same\\nfor other public use or purpose of the city or to sell and convey the\\nsame in behalf of the city, provided, however, that no such sale or\\nconveyance shall be made except with the approval of the board of\\nestimate, and provided further that the proceeds of any such sale or\\nconveyance, together with all rent received for the use, occupation or\\nlease of any property acquired as provided in this chapter, shall, under\\nthe direction of the board of transportation, be applied either to the\\nacquisition of other property necessary for rapid transit purposes or,\\nin the case of rent so far as necessary, to the maintenance of property\\nacquired for rapid transit purposes or shall be applied in all respects\\nas the payments of rental to be made by the contractor as provided in\\nthis chapter. Whenever the city shall have acquired any property rights\\nas provided in this chapter and shall have thereafter acquired such\\nproperty in fee, such property rights shall be deemed to be merged in\\nsuch fee estate. Whenever any property rights which the city shall have\\nacquired as provided in this chapter in or to any property shall be\\nunnecessary for rapid transit purposes, the board of transportation may\\nsell and release the same in behalf of the city to the owner of such\\nproperty, provided, however, that no such sale or release shall be made\\nexcept with the approval of the board of estimate. Whenever any property\\nshall be sold as provided in this chapter, the grant or conveyance may\\ncontain such terms, conditions, provisos and limitations as the board of\\ntransportation may deem proper, and such board, in and by such grant or\\nconveyance may make such covenants and give such warranty in behalf of\\nthe city as such board may deem proper, including covenants as to the\\nsize, weight or character of building which any such rapid transit\\nrailroad for which an easement in such property is reserved will\\nsupport. In the case of any such sale or conveyance such board also may\\naccept in part payment for the property sold a bond or other obligation\\nto the city secured by purchase money mortgage on such property, such\\nbond or other obligation and such mortgage to contain such terms and\\nconditions as such board may deem proper, including in the discretion of\\nthe board provision for the payment of the amount of such bond or other\\nobligation in installments.\\n  c. The board of estimate with the approval of the mayor, upon the\\nrequirement of the board of transportation, may establish the grade of\\nany street or change the grade of any street for the purpose of\\nconstructing or operating a rapid transit railroad or its appurtenances.\\nThere shall be no liability to abutting owners for changing for such\\nrapid transit purposes a grade once established by lawful authority,\\nexcept where the owner of the abutting property has built upon or\\notherwise improved the property in conformity with such established\\ngrade, and such grade is changed after such building or improvements\\nhave been made. In such cases damages occasioned by such change of grade\\nto such buildings and improvements shall be ascertained as provided in\\nthis chapter. A grade shall be deemed established by lawful authority\\nwithin the meaning of this subdivision where it was originally adopted\\nby the action of the public authorities, or where the street or avenue\\nhas been used by the public as of right for ten years and been improved\\nby the public authority at the expense of the public or of the abutting\\nowners. In case the grade of any such street shall be changed for the\\npurpose of constructing and operating a rapid transit railroad or its\\nappurtenances and graded according to the new grade, the board of\\ntransportation shall transmit to the board of assessors a certificate\\nstating that the grade of the street has been changed for the purpose of\\nconstructing and operating a railroad or its appurtenances, and\\naccompany such certificate with a plan indicating the original grade,\\nthe changed grade and the buildings or other improvements affected\\nthereby. It shall be the duty of the board of assessors to cause to be\\npublished at the expense of the board of transportation in the City\\nRecord, or other official publication of the city, daily for two weeks,\\nand in two daily newspapers published in the city, twice in each week\\nfor two weeks, immediately prior to such hearing, a notice which shall\\ncontain a request for all persons claiming to have been injured by such\\nchange of grade, to present, in writing to the secretary of the board of\\nassessors, their claims. Such notice shall specify a place where, and a\\ntime when the board of assessors will receive evidence and testimony of\\nthe nature and extent of such injury. After hearing and considering such\\ntestimony and evidence, the board of assessors shall make such awards\\nfor such loss and damage, if any, as it may deem proper. The proceedings\\nand determination of the board of assessors shall be subject to review\\nby the board of revision of assessments of the city, as in the case of\\nother awards of damages for change of grade of streets in such city. The\\ncity shall, within four months after the making of any such award, pay\\nto the respective parties entitled thereto the amount of such award, and\\nin case of its neglect or failure to pay the same at the expiration of\\nsuch period, and after demand, it shall be lawful for the persons\\nentitled to the same to sue for and recover the amount of their awards.\\nIn case any such award or compensation shall be paid to any person not\\nentitled thereto, when the same ought to have been paid to some other\\nperson, it shall be lawful for the person to whom the same ought to have\\nbeen paid to sue for and recover the same with interest and costs, as so\\nmuch money had and received to his use by the person to whom the same\\nshall have been so paid; provided that when the name of the owner or\\nparty is not set forth in the report of the assessors, or where such\\nowner, party or person being named therein shall be under legal\\ndisability or absent from the city, or after diligent search cannot be\\nfound, or his title to receive such award is disputed, it shall be\\nlawful for the city to pay the sum mentioned in such report, or that\\nwould be coming to such owner, party or person, to the comptroller to be\\nsecured, disposed of and invested as the supreme court shall direct, and\\nsuch payment shall be as valid and effectual in all respects as if made\\nto such owner, party or person, himself, according to his just rights,\\nif he had been known and had not been under legal disability.\\n  d. Whenever the board of transportation for and in behalf of the city\\nshall have acquired or shall hereafter acquire an easement in property\\nby conveyance or grant for the purpose of the operation or construction\\nof a railroad, such board in behalf of the city and as part\\nconsideration for the grant or conveyance of the easement, may enter\\ninto an agreement with the grantor of such easement or right of way,\\ngiving to such grantor or his assigns, the right of lateral or other\\nsupport through, in or under such property, or any adjoining lands or\\nspace occupied by such railroad for any building erected or to be\\nerected upon the land over which the easement or right of way has been\\nobtained for the support and maintenance of any such building, provided\\nthat any structure that shall be built for the support of any such\\nbuilding shall be approved by such board and shall not extend in or\\nunder any street beyond the curb lines as fixed by the appropriate\\nauthority of such city.\\n  e. The board of transportation temporarily may let or allow the use\\nand occupation of any property acquired as provided in this chapter, and\\nreceive rent therefor between the time of the acquisition thereof and\\nthe time when it shall be required for construction or operation of such\\nroad, or shall be sold as aforesaid, and in case of default of any\\ntenant may prosecute any action or proceeding to recover possession of\\nthe premises so let or used and occupied. The board of transportation,\\nwith the approval of the board of estimate, also may lease any property\\nacquired as provided in this chapter for the highest marketable rental\\nat public auction or by sealed bids, and always after public\\nadvertisement for a period of at least fifteen days in the City Record,\\nfor such term not exceeding twenty-one years and upon such conditions as\\nthe board of transportation may deem proper, and, in the discretion of\\nsuch board, may provide in such lease for one renewal of not more than\\ntwenty-one years. All rent received for the use, occupation or lease of\\nany such property shall be paid to the comptroller and shall be applied\\nin like manner as the proceeds of sales of property acquired hereunder\\nare directed to be applied in subdivision b of this section.\\n  f. Whenever any property owned by the city and in use by any\\ndepartment of the city including property acquired for park purposes\\nshall be deemed available by the board of transportation for the purpose\\nof operation or construction of a railroad and wherever any property\\nacquired for and on behalf of the city by such board or any of its\\npredecessors shall be deemed available by the head of any department of\\nthe city for the use of such department, the board of estimate,\\nnotwithstanding any provision of law, may authorize an exchange of such\\nproperties at a valuation and upon such terms as may be agreed upon by\\nthe board of transportation and the board of estimate. Whenever any\\nproperty of the city shall have been turned over by any department of\\nthe city to the board of estimate to be disposed of according to law,\\nsuch property or any portion thereof, upon the application of the board\\nof transportation, may be turned over to the board of transportation at\\na valuation and upon such terms as may be agreed upon by such board and\\nthe board of estimate. Notwithstanding any provision of law, such\\nproperty shall be used for the purpose of operation or construction of a\\nrailroad or any other purpose of the board of transportation under this\\nchapter. The board of estimate may accept in payment or in part payment\\ntherefor property previously acquired by the board of transportation for\\nand on behalf of the city which is no longer required for the purpose of\\noperation or construction of a railroad or other purpose of such board\\nunder this chapter, but which in the judgment of the board of estimate\\nmay be used by the city or one or more of its departments.\\n  g. The existence of an easement acquired for and in behalf of a city\\nunder this chapter shall not be deemed an incumbrance, under any law\\nrelating to investments in mortgages upon real property by corporations,\\ntrustees, executors, administrators, guardians or other persons holding\\ntrust funds, but the effect of such an easement upon the real property\\nwhich it affects shall be taken into consideration in determining the\\nvalue thereof.\\n",

The commission, with like approval, may also\\nauthorize any such person to lay his tracks and operate his railroad to\\nany terminal within such city, and to transport thereover passengers or\\nfreight or both, and to run either passenger trains or freight trains or\\nmixed trains thereover.  The commission, with like approval, shall fix\\nand determine the locations and plans of construction of the railroads\\nupon such facilities, the times within which they shall be respectively\\nconstructed, the compensation to be made therefor to the city by such\\nperson, and such other terms, conditions and requirements as to such\\ncommission and board of estimate with the approval of the mayor may\\nappear just and proper.  Every such determination, authorization and\\nlicense shall be made upon the condition that such person, from the time\\nof the commencement of the operation of any such railroad under such\\ndetermination, authorization or license, shall annually pay to such city\\na sum or rental which may be a part or proportion of gross or net\\nreceipts, and that the amount of such sum or rental for a period of not\\nmore than twenty-five years, beginning with such operation of any such\\nrailroad shall be prescribed by the commission in such determination,\\nauthorization and license, and that every such determination,\\nauthorization and license shall provide for the readjustment of the\\namount of such sum or rental at the expiration of the period for which\\nit shall be so prescribed and for readjustment from time to time in the\\nfuture, to the end of the period of renewal, if any, of the amount of\\nsuch annual payment at intervals each of not more than twenty years.\\nSuch determination, authorization or license may provide that for the\\nwhole or any portion of the life of the grant in lieu of such annual\\nrental the gross or net receipts derived from the operation of such\\nrailroad owned, operated or to be operated by such person within the\\nlimits of such city, and from the operation of such connecting or\\nextending facilities may be combined, and that the city may receive as\\nsuch compensation at intervals named a specified part or proportion of\\nthe income, earnings or profits of the railroad, and the facilities\\nwhose receipts are so combined or of those and any other railroads which\\nmay be operated in connection therewith in like manner, which part or\\nproportion may be deferred to a previous distribution to such person,\\nwhich distribution may be cumulative.

Such certificate shall be\\ndelivered to such person upon the receipt by such commission of a\\nwritten acceptance of such terms, conditions and requirements, duly\\nexecuted by such person so as to entitle it to be recorded.\\n  c. Such certificate shall be filed in the office of the secretary of\\nstate, and a duly certified copy thereof shall be filed in the office of\\nthe clerk of each county to which such privileges granted hereunder\\npertain, and thereupon, and upon fulfillment, by such person so far as\\nit relates to such facilities, of such of the requirements and\\nconditions as are necessary to be fulfilled in such cases, under section\\nseventeen of article three of the constitution.

When any\\nfacilities, shall be so fixed and determined, and a certificate as\\naforesaid shall have been duly filed, such person may construct them\\nwith all the rights, and with like effect as though they had been a part\\nof the original route of his railroad then in actual operation or in\\nprocess of construction.  A franchise, right or authority shall not be\\ngranted under this section to extend any railroad, make any connections,\\nlay any additional track or acquire any terminal or other facilities for\\na longer period than the unexpired term of the original grant, franchise\\nor contract of the railroad and any renewal thereof contained in such\\ncontract to which such facilities are added. Any such franchise, right\\nor authority granted hereunder shall also be subject to be terminated by\\nthe city in like manner and under the same terms and conditions and at\\nthe same time as may be provided in such original grant for the\\ntermination or taking by the city of that grant if provision therefor be\\nmade.\\n  d.

The terms of such contract, from time to time with the consent\\nof such person, may be modified by the commission. In the case of any\\ngrant under this section for the extension of any railroad or the\\nmaking, laying or acquisition of facilities under the provisions of this\\nsection, the commission may make provision as a condition of such grant\\nfor the termination by the city of the original grant or franchise or\\ncontract, for the railroad to which such facilities are to be added and\\nfor the taking over at the same time of the plant and property of the\\ngrantee or holder of such original franchise or contract suitable to and\\nused for the purpose of such original grant or contract in connection\\nwith the termination of the franchise, right or authority granted under\\nthis section, upon giving a specified notice and paying an amount for\\nsuch plant and property, as property, excluding any value for the\\noriginal franchise or contract, which amount shall not exceed actual\\ncost of such plant and property plus fifteen per cent. thereof.  Such\\namount shall decrease under the provisions of the grant made hereunder\\nas the franchise or contract continues, so that at the end of the grant\\nor contract no amount shall be paid except for equipment as defined in\\nthe grant. The grant shall provide a method of ascertaining the amount\\nto be paid for such plant and property on termination by the city of\\nsuch original franchise or contract or for equipment at the end of the\\nfull term thereof. The grant may provide for determining from time to\\ntime in default of agreement by arbitration or by the court a valuation\\nof such plant and property or any part or portion thereof for any\\npurpose under such grant. The grant in such case may also make suitable\\nprovision to the end that if the city shall after so terminating such\\noriginal grant or franchise or at the end of the full term thereof\\npropose to grant a a new franchise, right or authority in the enjoyment\\nof which such plant and property or any part thereof may be utilized,\\nthe title to and possession of such plant and property or any part\\nthereof may be transferred directly to the grantee of any such new\\nfranchise.\\n  e. But the construction and operation of such facilities are hereby\\nauthorized only upon condition that the consent of the owners of\\none-half in value of the property bounded on, and the consent also of\\nthe board of estimate and of the mayor be first obtained, or in case the\\nconsent of such property owners cannot be obtained, the appellate\\ndivision of the supreme court in the department in which they are\\nproposed to be constructed, upon application, in the same manner, and on\\nthe same notice specified in section twenty-one of this chapter, may\\nappoint three commissioners who shall determine after a hearing of all\\nthe parties interested whether such facilities ought to be constructed\\nor operated, and their determination, confirmed by the court, may be\\ntaken in lieu of the consent of the property owners.\\n  f. Every such certificate granting any franchise, right or authority,\\nas aforesaid, except for additional track added to any elevated rapid\\ntransit railroad, shall provide that upon the expiration of a period\\nfixed therein the franchise shall end and that upon such termination\\nthereof all the rights of property of the grantee in the streets shall\\ncease and terminate without compensation and shall further provide that\\nupon such expiration of such franchise, right or authority the plant and\\nproperty together with the appurtenances thereto, of the grantee,\\nconstructed pursuant to such certificate, except betterments, additions,\\nimprovements and additional equipment as defined in the grant, shall\\nbecome the property of the city without further or other compensation to\\nthe grantee; and that such betterments, additions, improvements and\\nadditional equipment shall be and become the property of the city on\\npaying the grantee the amount ascertained as provided pursuant to such\\ncertificate.

The commission after making the\\nnecessary studies and investigations shall prepare a plan for the relief\\nof the emergency which is hereby declared to exist, and for the\\nimprovement of transit in any such city.  Such plan shall contain\\nprovisions which in the judgment of the commission, will accomplish as\\nnearly as may be the following purposes:\\n  1. The acquisition and unification, under public ownership or control,\\nof railroads by purchase and direct conveyance or transfer, or by lease,\\nrecapture, assignment of lease, modification or extinguishment of\\nexisting contract or by contracts for equipment, maintenance and\\noperation or maintenance and operation, by or under supervision of a\\nboard of transportation, or partly by one of such methods and partly by\\none or more of the others, so that service thereon may be increased,\\nextended and improved to the fullest extent possible,\\n  2. The receipt as soon as practicable by the city of net revenues from\\nthe operation of the railroads which will be applicable to the payment\\nof interest and amortization charges on corporate stock or bonds of the\\ncity after deduction of all expenses of maintenance and operation,\\nreserves for depreciation and otherwise, interest and amortization\\ncharges and other deductions as may be provided in a plan or in any\\ncontract or lease made in pursuance of its provisions, and\\n  3. The assuring to the people of the city the continued operation of\\nthe railroads at the present or lowest possible fares consistent with\\ntheir safe and economical operation and the performance by the board of\\nits obligations under any plan and under any lease or contract made in\\npursuance of its provisions.\\nIn case a plan or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto or\\nseparate plan adopted with the approval of the board of estimate of the\\ncity as provided in this article, shall include any street surface\\nrailroads, it may also include any stage coach or omnibus lines,\\ntogether with the plant, property and equipment thereof, owned or\\noperated in conjunction with, or as a part of the same system as, such\\nstreet surface railroads.\\n b. The commission shall include in the plan appropriate provision for\\nthe protection of tort creditors; and shall provide for the continuance\\nin original or modified form of any existing plan or provision of\\nrailroad companies for employees' pension and sick benefit relief, but\\nsuch continuance shall in no manner or form impair the actuarial status\\nor benefits of employees who are members of the New York city employees'\\nretirement system. Without limiting the authority and discretion of the\\ncommission, it may consider the incorporation in the plan of provisions\\nwhereby the title to such railroads as are not already owned by the city\\nand whose ownership thereby is deemed by the commission to be desirable\\nmay be vested in the city and whereby rights under existing contracts\\nfor the construction, equipment and operation of rapid transit railroads\\nalready owned by the city may be acquired by the city. Such title and/or\\nsuch rights may be vested in the city directly or may first pass through\\nan intervening corporation and then to the city, either free and clear\\nof liens and encumbrances or subject to specified liens and\\nencumbrances, in return for a lease or leases by the city of such\\nrailroads and of any other railroads owned by it and such other or\\nadditional considerations as the commission may determine with the\\napproval of the board of estimate. In the event of the incorporation of\\nsuch provisions in the plan the commission shall outline an arrangement\\nwhereby outstanding securities of the railroad companies may be retired\\nby application of the amounts paid by the city for the railroads\\nacquired and whereby such securities may be amortized or otherwise paid.\\nAny railroad company included in the plan, with the consent of the\\nholders of record of at least two-thirds of its outstanding shares of\\nstock entitled to vote thereon, given as provided in section one hundred\\nforty-eight of the railroad law, may transfer and convey its property,\\nappurtenances and franchises, or any part thereof, to the city and/or\\nsuch intervening corporation as provided in the plan, subject, however,\\nto the rights of appraisal of the shares of any dissenting stockholder\\nas provided in section one hundred sixty-one of the railroad law. Any\\nrailroad company included in a plan whose entire outstanding capital\\nstock or whose railroad facilities are acquired by the city as provided\\ntherein may be dissolved without judicial proceeding in the same manner\\nas provided in and subject to the same provisions as contained in\\nsection one hundred five of the stock corporation law with respect to\\nthe dissolution of stock corporations, and upon filing the certificate\\nof dissolution in the office of the secretary of state, titles to and\\nownership of the railroad, franchises, properties and assets of such\\nrailroad company shall pass to and vest in the city. The certificate of\\ndissolution of any such railroad company shall bear endorsed thereon, in\\naddition to the consent of the state tax commission, the approval and\\nconsent of the commission to the filing of such certificate.\\n  c. In connection with the preparation of any plan the commission shall\\ncause a valuation to be made of the railroads, properties and interests\\ntherein, including leases and leasehold interests and outstanding\\ncontracts the assignment to or cancellation of which by the city may be\\ndeemed advisable but excluding franchises and going value, of the\\nrailroad company or railroad companies it proposes to include therein.\\nAny such valuation including the value of contracts acquired may be in\\nsuch detail and include such elements of cost or value and be made in\\nsuch manner as the commission from time to time may determine and\\nprescribe, with due regard to the past, present and estimated\\nprospective earnings of such railroads, properties and interests at the\\nrate of fare that the railroad company prior to April twenty-seventh,\\nnineteen hundred twenty-one was entitled to charge under the provisions\\nof the contracts or franchises under which such properties are operated\\nor held or of any lawful order then in force fixing or regulating rates\\nof fare, or under existing law, and in view of the competition of other\\nlines and with due regard to all other pertinent facts and conditions;\\nbut such valuation shall not in any case exceed the fair reproduction\\ncost of such properties less depreciation, and, in the case of leasehold\\ninterests and contracts to be assigned, acquired or cancelled, the fair\\nvalue of any such leaseholds and contracts. Any such valuation as\\nfinally determined by the commission may be the basis for the inclusion\\nof such railroads, properties, contracts and interests in the plan and\\nfor fixing the allowances and returns on account thereof under the plan\\nand under any leases or contracts made in pursuance of its provisions.\\n  d. In connection with the preparation of the plan the commission may\\ninclude in the plan provision for railroads operating between a point\\nwithin the city and a point without the city and connecting railroads\\nwhose lines stop at or near the city line. The plan may also include, in\\naddition to and in conjunction with the railroad of a railroad company\\nincluded therein, a railroad owned by the city and/or a railroad leased\\nor to be leased by the city from the owner or lessee of such railroad.\\n",

Upon the completion of such plan, but\\nbefore final adoption thereof, the commission shall hold a public\\nhearing thereon at which citizens shall be entitled to appear and be\\nheard. The commission shall transmit a copy thereof to the board of\\nestimate of the city and to each of the railroad companies which owns,\\nleases or operates any of the railroads included therein with a request\\nfor the statement of the views of such board of estimate and such\\nrailroad companies thereon. Such board of estimate and each such\\nrailroad company may transmit such views and be heard thereon within a\\nperiod of time to be prescribed by the commission. Thereafter the\\ncommission, from time to time, may make such changes in or modifications\\nof such plan as the commission in its discretion may deem to be\\nadvisable. The commission shall then formally adopt the plan and call\\nupon each of the railroad companies which owns, leases or operates any\\nof the railroads included therein or whose leasehold, contract or other\\ninterests are to be acquired to inform it within a period of time to be\\nfixed by the commission whether it accepts such plan. Any such plan as\\nformally adopted by the commission may provide that the commission, with\\nthe approval of the board of estimate, from time to time, shall\\ndetermine whether and when a sufficient amount of the securities to be\\nadjusted have been deposited under or have otherwise assented to the\\nplan to render it advisable to declare the plan operative, and in such\\nlatter event the plan shall not be or become operative until so declared\\nby the commission with the approval of the board of estimate. If the\\nrailroad companies or one or more of them do so accept, or if in the\\njudgment of the commission a sufficient number of them so accept as to\\njustify carrying out the plan, and if the board of estimate also\\napproves the plan, and the plan is or is declared operative in\\naccordance with its terms, the board of estimate shall take all such\\naction as may be necessary or convenient to carry out the plan. All\\ndeeds, assignments or surrenders of leaseholds and contracts and other\\ninterests, leases, mortgages, contracts and other documents shall be\\napproved by the commission.\\n  b. The plan may include all the railroads or systems of railroads and\\ncontrolling or leasehold interests therein which the commission decides\\nshould be included thereunder or may in the first instance include one\\nor more railroads or systems of railroads, or controlling or leasehold\\ninterests therein and may thereafter, with the approval of the board of\\nestimate be amended or supplemented at any time or from time to time,\\neither before or after the completion thereof, to include one or more\\nadditional railroads or systems of railroads, or controlling or\\nleasehold interests therein as the commission may decide, or there may\\nbe several plans each comprising different railroads or systems of\\nrailroads.  The commission, if in its judgment such action is necessary,\\nbut only after a public hearing, and with the consent of the board of\\nestimate and of each railroad company whose railroads or interests\\ntherein are included therein, from time to time may modify such plan\\nafter formal adoption thereof. The commission may further extend any\\nperiod of time prescribed in this article or by it thereunder with like\\nauthority.\\n  c. The grant of power herein conferred shall embrace, and the words\\n\"the railroad\" as used herein shall be deemed to embrace, contracts and\\nleases for the use and operation of railroads, including existing\\ncontracts and leases between the city and a railroad company for the\\nconstruction, equipment, maintenance and operation of railroads under\\nthis chapter; provided, however, that the acquisition of any such\\ncontract so made by the city or its transfer to the city shall not\\noperate as a merger or cancellation of such contract, unless otherwise\\nprovided in the plan, but such contract may be held in trust by the city\\nfor the beneficiaries thereunder, including the city, as provided in the\\nplan until such time as the obligations in respect thereto under the\\nplan shall have been discharged.\\n  e. Railroads and interests therein may be acquired by the city subject\\nto all or any mortgages that may be existing thereon. In the event that\\nrailroads or interests therein are acquired in whole or in part subject\\nto existing mortgages, all the obligations of any mortgage subject to\\nwhich the railroads are acquired in its discretion, may, and if required\\nby the terms of such mortgage, shall be assumed by the city, provided,\\nthat any such acquisition and assumption shall in no respect increase,\\ndiminish, alter or otherwise affect any rights vested in the trustee or\\nthe bondholders under any such mortgage.\\n  f. The plan and any contract, lease or mortgage made in pursuance\\nthereof may contain such other terms, conditions and covenants, not\\ninconsistent with this article, as the commission or board of estimate\\nshall deem to be necessary or advisable, including provision whereby\\nelevated railroads or portions thereof acquired by the city may be\\nremoved under arrangements between the mortgage trustees and the board\\nof estimate.\\n  g. After the approval of such plan, as provided in this section, and\\nthereupon, if the plan is or is declared to be operative in accordance\\nwith its terms, the board of estimate may consummate the transaction by\\nthe execution and delivery of the deeds of conveyance and instruments of\\ntransfer, leases, mortgages, contracts and all other instruments and\\ndocuments, necessary or advisable for carrying the plan into effect\\nwhich shall be approved by the commission.\\n  h. All the provisions of this article and all powers hereby granted\\nwith reference to railroads and properties and interests therein shall\\nlikewise apply with equal force and effect to recaptured railroads;\\nprovided, however, that nothing contained in this article with respect\\nto recapture or recaptured railroads shall alter or affect any rights or\\nremedies of the city or of any railroad company under any existing\\ncontract.\\n  i. If, pursuant to a plan, the city shall become the owner or holder\\nof securities of a corporation owning the railroads to be acquired under\\nthe plan, or the securities of a corporation holding the securities of\\nsuch owning corporation, or securities to which such railroads are\\nsubject, such securities shall be delivered into the custody of the\\ncomptroller of the city.
