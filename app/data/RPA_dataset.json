That the state shall have a lien upon such real property or part\\nthereof described in such tax deed, prior and superior to all other\\nliens, (a) for the amount of the unpaid taxes not adjudged illegal in\\nsuch action for which such real property was sold or liable to be sold\\nin the first instance and for which such tax deed was issued, together\\nwith fees, charges and interest; (b) for the amount of the unpaid taxes\\nnot adjudged illegal in such action for which such real property was\\nsubsequently sold or liable to be sold, together with fees, charges and\\ninterest; (c) for the amount of all taxes, fees and charges admitted or\\npaid by the state upon such real property to the date of the entry of\\nsuch judgment, together with interest thereon from the date of such\\nadmission or payment. In the determination of the amount of such lien,\\nestablishment of payments of taxes on said real property by the adjudged\\nor admitted owner of the property during any of the same years in which\\npayments were also made by the state shall reduce the lien of the state\\nby the larger of the two tax payments for each of the years affected by\\nduplicate payments, and in the event that wholly identical areas are not\\naffected by the duplicate payments the court shall have power to\\napportion and adjust the amount of the lien as equity may require.\\n  2.

A tenant\\nshall include an occupant of one or more rooms in a rooming house or a\\nresident, not including a transient occupant, of one or more rooms in a\\nhotel who has been in possession for thirty consecutive days or longer.\\nNo tenant or lawful occupant of a dwelling or housing accommodation\\nshall be removed from possession except in a special proceeding. A\\nspecial proceeding may be maintained under this article upon the\\nfollowing grounds:\\n  1. The tenant continues in possession of any portion of the premises\\nafter the expiration of his term, without the permission of the landlord\\nor, in a case where a new lessee is entitled to possession, without the\\npermission of the new lessee. Acceptance of rent after commencement of\\nthe special proceeding upon this ground shall not terminate such\\nproceeding nor effect any award of possession to the landlord or to the\\nnew lessee, as the case may be. A proceeding seeking to recover\\npossession of real property by reason of the termination of the term\\nfixed in the lease pursuant to a provision contained therein giving the\\nlandlord the right to terminate the time fixed for occupancy under such\\nagreement if he deem the tenant objectionable, shall not be maintainable\\nunless the landlord shall by competent evidence establish to the\\nsatisfaction of the court that the tenant is objectionable.\\n  2. The tenant has defaulted in the payment of rent, pursuant to the\\nagreement under which the premises are held, and a written demand of the\\nrent has been made with at least fourteen days' notice requiring, in the\\nalternative, the payment of the rent, or the possession of the premises,\\nhas been served upon him as prescribed in section seven hundred\\nthirty-five of this article. Any person succeeding to the landlord's\\ninterest in the premises may proceed under this subdivision for rent due\\nhis predecessor in interest if he has a right thereto. Where a tenant\\ndies during the term of the lease and rent due has not been paid and the\\napartment is occupied by a person with a claim to possession, a\\nproceeding may be commenced naming the occupants of the apartment\\nseeking a possessory judgment only as against the estate. Entry of such\\na judgment shall be without prejudice to the possessory claims of the\\noccupants, and any warrant issued shall not be effective as against the\\noccupants.\\n  3. The tenant, in a city defaults in the payment, for sixty days after\\nthe same shall be payable, of any taxes or assessments levied on the\\npremises which he has agreed in writing to pay pursuant to the agreement\\nunder which the premises are held, and a demand for payment has been\\nmade, or at least three days' notice in writing, requiring in the\\nalternative the payment thereof and of any interest and penalty thereon,\\nor the possession of the premises, has been served upon him, as\\nprescribed in section 735. An acceptance of any rent shall not be\\nconstrued as a waiver of the agreement to pay taxes or assessments.\\n  4.

In a\\nproceeding to recover the possession of premises occupied for dwelling\\npurposes, other than a room or rooms in an hotel, lodging house, or\\nrooming house, the court, on application of the occupant, may stay the\\nissuance of a warrant and also stay any execution to collect the costs\\nof the proceeding for a period of not more than one year, if it appears\\nthat the premises are used for dwelling purposes; that the application\\nis made in good faith; that the applicant cannot within the neighborhood\\nsecure suitable premises similar to those occupied by the applicant and\\nthat the applicant made due and reasonable efforts to secure such other\\npremises, or that by reason of other facts it would occasion extreme\\nhardship to the applicant or the applicant's family if the stay were not\\ngranted. In determining whether refusal to grant a stay would occasion\\nextreme hardship, the court shall consider serious ill health,\\nsignificant exacerbation of an ongoing condition, a child's enrollment\\nin a local school, and any other extenuating life circumstances\\naffecting the ability of the applicant or the applicant's family to\\nrelocate and maintain quality of life. The court shall consider any\\nsubstantial hardship the stay may impose on the landlord in determining\\nwhether to grant the stay or in setting the length or other terms of the\\nstay. In an application brought outside a city of one million or more,\\nthe term \"neighborhood\" shall be construed to mean (i) the same town,\\nvillage or city where the applicant now resides, or (ii) if the\\napplicant has school aged children residing with him or her,\\n\"neighborhood\" shall mean the school district where such children attend\\nor are eligible to attend.\\n  2. Such stay shall be granted and continue effective only upon the\\ncondition that the person against whom the judgment is entered shall\\nmake a deposit in court of the entire amount, or such installments\\nthereof from time to time as the court may direct, for the occupation of\\nthe premises for the period of the stay, at the rate for which the\\napplicant was liable as rent for the month immediately prior to the\\nexpiration of the applicant's term or tenancy, plus such additional\\namount, if any, as the court may determine to be the difference between\\nsuch rent and the reasonable rent or value of the use and occupation of\\nthe premises; such deposit may also include all rent unpaid by the\\noccupant prior to the period of the stay. The amount of such deposit\\nshall be determined by the court upon the application for the stay and\\nsuch determination shall be final and conclusive in respect to the\\namount of such deposit, and the amount thereof shall be paid into court,\\nin such manner and in such installments, if any, as the court may\\ndirect. A separate account shall be kept of the amount to the credit of\\neach proceeding, and all such payments shall be deposited in a bank or\\ntrust company and shall be subject to the check of the clerk of the\\ncourt, if there be one, or otherwise of the court. The clerk of the\\ncourt, if there be one, and otherwise the court shall pay to the\\nlandlord or the landlord's duly authorized agent, the amount of such\\ndeposit in accordance with the terms of the stay or the further order of\\nthe court.\\n  3. The provisions of this section shall not apply to a proceeding to\\nrecover possession upon the ground that an occupant is holding over and\\nis objectionable if the landlord shall establish by competent evidence\\nto the satisfaction of the court that such occupant is objectionable.\\n  4. In the event that such proceeding is based upon a claim that the\\ntenant or lessee has breached a provision of the lease, the court shall\\ngrant a thirty day stay of issuance of the warrant, during which time\\nthe respondent may correct such breach.\\n  5.

The court shall issue promptly an order\\nreallocating the interests of all of the co-tenants and disburse the\\namounts held by the court to the persons entitled to such amounts.\\n  (ii) If no co-tenant pays the entire price for the remaining interest,\\nthe court shall resolve the partition action under paragraphs (a) and\\n(b) of subdivision eight of this section as if the interests of the\\nco-tenants that requested partition by sale were not purchased.\\n  (iii) If more than one co-tenant pays the entire price for the\\nremaining interest, the court shall reapportion those remaining\\ninterests among those paying co-tenants, based on each paying\\nco-tenant's original fractional ownership of the entire parcel divided\\nby the total original fractional ownership of all co-tenants that paid\\nthe entire price for the remaining interest. The court shall issue\\npromptly an order reallocating all of the co-tenants' interests,\\ndisburse the amounts held by the court to the persons entitled to such\\namounts, and promptly refund any excess payment held by the court.\\n  (g) Not later than forty-five days after the court sends notice to the\\nparties pursuant to paragraph (a) of this subdivision, any co-tenant\\nentitled to buy an interest under this subdivision may request the court\\nto authorize the sale as part of the pending action of the interests of\\nco-tenants named as defendants and served with the complaint but that\\ndid not appear in the action.\\n  (h) If the court receives a timely request under paragraph (g) of this\\nsubdivision, the court, after a hearing, may deny the request or\\nauthorize the requested additional sale on such terms as the court\\ndetermines are fair and reasonable, subject to the following\\nlimitations:\\n  (i) a sale authorized under this subdivision may occur only after the\\npurchase prices for all interests subject to sale under paragraphs (a),\\n(b), (c), (d), (e) and (f) of this subdivision have been paid to the\\ncourt and such interests have been reallocated among the co-tenants as\\nprovided in such paragraphs; and\\n  (ii) the purchase price for the interest of a non-appearing co-tenant\\nis based on the court's determination of value under subdivision six of\\nthis section.\\n  8. Partition alternatives. (a) If all the interests of all co-tenants\\nthat requested partition by sale are not purchased by other co-tenants\\npursuant to subdivision seven of this section, or if after conclusion of\\nthe buyout under subdivision seven of this section, a co-tenant remains\\nthat has requested partition in kind, the court shall order partition in\\nkind unless the court, after consideration of the factors listed in\\nsubdivision nine of this section, finds that partition in kind will\\nresult in great manifest prejudice to the co-tenants as a group. In\\nconsidering whether to order partition in kind, the court shall approve\\na request by two or more parties to have their individual interests\\naggregated.\\n  (b) If the court does not order partition in kind under paragraph (a)\\nof this subdivision, the court shall order partition by sale pursuant to\\nsubdivision ten of this section provided that, if no co-tenant timely\\nrequested partition by sale, the court shall dismiss the action.\\n  (c) If the court orders partition in kind pursuant to paragraph (a) of\\nthis subdivision, the court may require that one or more co-tenants pay\\none or more other co-tenants amounts so that the payments, taken\\ntogether with the value of the in kind distributions to the co-tenants,\\nwill make the partition in kind just and proportionate in value to the\\nfractional interests held.\\n  (d) If the court orders partition in kind, the court shall allocate to\\nthe co-tenants that are unknown, cannot be located, or the subject of a\\ndefault judgment, if the co-tenants interests were not bought out\\npursuant to subdivision seven of this section, a part of the property\\nrepresenting the combined interests of such co-tenants as determined by\\nthe court and such part of the property shall remain undivided.\\n  9. Considerations for partition in kind. (a) In determining under\\nsubdivision eight of this section whether partition in kind would result\\nin great manifest prejudice to the co-tenants as a group, the court\\nshall consider the following:\\n  (i) whether the heirs property practicably can be divided among the\\nco-tenants;\\n  (ii) whether partition in kind would apportion the property in such a\\nway that the aggregate fair market value of the parcels resulting from\\nthe division would be materially less than the amount reasonably\\nexpected to be realized if the property were sold as a whole, taking\\ninto account the conditions under which a court-ordered sale likely\\nwould occur;\\n  (iii) evidence of the collective duration of ownership or possession\\nof the property by a co-tenant and one or more predecessors in title or\\npredecessors in possession to the co-tenant who are or were relatives of\\nthe co-tenant or each other;\\n  (iv) a co-tenant's sentimental attachment to the property, including\\nany attachment arising because the property has ancestral or other\\nunique or special value to the co-tenant;\\n  (v) the lawful use being made of the property by a resident or other\\nco-tenant and the degree to which any such co-tenant would be harmed if\\nthe co-tenant could not continue the same use of the property;\\n  (vi) the degree to which the co-tenants have contributed their pro\\nrata share of the property taxes, insurance, and other expenses\\nassociated with maintaining ownership of the property or have\\ncontributed to the physical improvement, maintenance, or upkeep of the\\nproperty;\\n  (vii) the price, terms and conditions of the acquisition of the\\nco-tenant's interest in the property if such co-tenant is not a relative\\nof the person from whom it acquired his or her interest; and\\n  (viii) any other relevant factor.\\n  (b) The court shall not consider any one factor in paragraph (a) of\\nthis subdivision to be dispositive without weighing the totality of all\\nrelevant factors and circumstances.\\n  10. Open-market sale, sealed bids, or auction. (a) If the court orders\\na sale of heirs property, notwithstanding section two hundred thirty-one\\nof this chapter, such sale shall be an open-market sale under this\\nsubdivision unless the court finds that a sale by sealed bids or an\\nauction would be more economically advantageous and in the best interest\\nof the co-tenants as a group.\\n  (b) If the court orders an open-market sale and the parties, not later\\nthan ten days after the entry of the order, agree on a real estate\\nbroker licensed in this state to offer the property for sale, the court\\nshall appoint the broker and establish a reasonable commission. If the\\nparties do not agree on a broker, the court shall appoint a\\ndisinterested real estate broker licensed in this state to offer the\\nproperty for sale and shall establish a reasonable commission. The\\nbroker shall offer the property for sale in a commercially reasonable\\nmanner at a price no lower than the determination of value and on the\\nterms and conditions established by the court.\\n  (c) If the broker appointed under paragraph (b) of this subdivision\\nobtains within a reasonable time an offer to purchase the property for\\nat least the determination of value:\\n  (i) the broker shall comply with the reporting requirements in\\nsubdivision eleven of this section; and\\n  (ii) the sale may be completed in accordance with the laws of this\\nstate other than this section.\\n  (d) If the broker appointed under paragraph (b) of this subdivision\\ndoes not obtain within a reasonable time an offer to purchase the\\nproperty for at least the determination of value, the court, after a\\nhearing, may:\\n  (i) order that the property continue to be offered for an additional\\ntime, by the same or a substitute broker, in accordance with paragraph\\n(b) of this subdivision; or\\n  (ii) if it determines that doing so would not be in the best interests\\nof the parties, approve the highest outstanding offer.\\n  (e) If after the court has appointed a substitute broker and there are\\nno reasonable offers for the property, the court may order the property\\nbe sold by sealed bids or an auction and, the court shall set terms and\\nconditions of the sale. If the court orders an auction, the auction\\nshall be conducted in accordance with section two hundred thirty-one of\\nthis chapter.\\n  (f) If a purchaser is entitled to a share of the proceeds of the sale,\\nthe purchaser is entitled to a credit against the price in an amount\\nequal to the purchaser's share of the net proceeds.\\n  11. Report of open-market sale. (a) Unless required to do so within a\\nshorter time by this article, a broker appointed under paragraph (b) of\\nsubdivision ten of this section to offer heirs property for open-market\\nsale shall file a report with the court not later than seven days after\\nreceiving an offer to purchase the property for at least the value\\ndetermined under subdivision six or ten of this section.\\n  (b) The report required by paragraph (a) of this subdivision shall\\ncontain the following information:\\n  (i) a description of the property to be sold to each buyer;\\n  (ii) the name of each buyer;\\n  (iii) the proposed purchase price;\\n  (iv) the terms and conditions of the proposed sale, including the\\nterms of any owner financing;\\n  (v) the amounts to be paid to lienholders;\\n  (vi) a statement of contractual or other arrangements or conditions of\\nthe broker's commission; and\\n  (vii) other material facts relevant to the sale.\\n",

Where real property is held by two or more persons in\\ntheir own right as tenants in common, joint tenants or tenants by the\\nentirety and one of such tenants is missing under circumstances which\\nafford reasonable ground to believe that he is dead, the other tenants\\nor tenant may maintain an action in the supreme court to obtain a\\ndetermination of the value of the estate of the missing co-tenant and a\\njudgment extinguishing the estate of the missing co-tenant upon payment\\ninto court for his credit of the amount so determined to be the value of\\nhis estate.\\n  Persons known or unknown who are or may be the devisees or\\ndistributees of a missing co-tenant may be joined as defendants in such\\naction.\\n  2. (a) Service upon the missing co-tenant shall be made in the manner\\nprovided for service in an action in which the complaint demands\\njudgment that the person to be served be excluded from a vested or\\ncontingent interest in specific real property in this state. In\\naddition, the court, at any stage of such action, may direct that notice\\nof the action be published at or near the place where the co-tenant,\\nwhen last heard from, was known or believed to be.\\n  (b) The court may, in its discretion, appoint a guardian ad litem to\\nrepresent the interests of the missing co-tenant, or of persons who are\\nor may be his devisees or distributees.\\n  3. A finding of reasonable ground to believe that the missing\\nco-tenant is dead may be made, for purposes of this section, either (a)\\nupon proof that the co-tenant has been absent from his usual place of\\nabode for seven successsive years last past, and that a diligent search\\nhas been made to discover evidence that he is living and that no such\\nevidence has been found, or (b) upon proof of other circumstances from\\nwhich the probability that the missing co-tenant is dead may reasonably\\nbe inferred, although the period of his absence is less than seven\\nyears, provided that such period is not less than one year.\\n  4. Relief extinguishing the estate of the missing person shall be\\ndeemed equitable and shall be granted in the discretion of the court.\\nHowever, no such relief shall be granted if the court shall find as a\\nfact that the missing person is dead. In such event, the judgment\\ndismissing the complaint shall state such determination, but shall not\\nbe deemed an adjudication of death of the missing person for any purpose\\nother than the dismissal of the complaint and shall not be controlling\\nin any other action or proceeding, whether or not between the same\\nparties, in which the fact of death of the missing person is in issue.\\n  5. The finding of reasonable ground to believe that the missing person\\nis dead shall be made, and the value of the property and of the estate\\nof the missing co-tenant shall be determined, by the court without a\\njury or by a referee.\\n  6. The value of the estates of tenants by the entirety shall be deemed\\nequal. The proportionate shares of joint tenants and tenants in common\\nshall be determined in like manner as in an action for partition.\\n  7. Costs of the action, and fees and disbursements of a guardian ad\\nlitem appointed to represent the interests of the missing co-tenant or\\nhis devisees or distributees shall be assessed against the parties in\\nsuch proportions as the court shall direct and the part thereof assessed\\nagainst the missing person shall be charged against the value of the\\nestate of the missing person.\\n  8. A judgment extinguishing the estate of the missing co-tenant shall\\nbe conclusive even though the missing person was in fact alive, or was\\nin fact dead, at the date of the entry thereof, and shall be conclusive\\nagainst (a) any person claiming under the missing person by title\\naccruing or conveyance recorded after the filing of the judgment-roll,\\nor of the notice of pendency of the action, and (b) any person claiming\\nunder the missing co-tenant who is made a party to the action. The\\njudgment shall also have like effect as a conveyance made by the missing\\nco-tenant or by the missing co-tenant and the other co-tenant or\\nco-tenants, conveying the premises to the co-tenant or co-tenants in\\naccordance with their interests resulting from the judgment. The court\\nmay direct that an instrument of conveyance in conformity with the\\njudgment be executed and delivered by the sheriff in the name of the\\nco-tenant.\\n",

The attorney-general shall be a party to such action.\\n  3. In determining whether relief shall be granted, and the nature of\\nsuch relief, the court shall consider and shall make findings with\\nrespect to the following:\\n  (a) whether the primary purpose of the special limitation, condition\\nsubsequent or agreement to convey, reconvey or surrender was to restrict\\nthe use of the land;\\n  (b) whether the purpose of the restriction was to ensure that the\\nsubstantial value of the land or of the estate subject to the special\\nlimitation, condition subsequent or agreement, rather than the land\\nitself, or such estate itself, be devoted to and employed for a\\nbenevolent, charitable, educational, public or religious purpose.\\n  If the findings with respect to (a) and (b) are such as to make the\\nfollowing matters relevant or appropriate for consideration, the court\\nshall also consider and make findings with respect to the following:\\n  (c) whether the existence of the restriction is substantially impeding\\nthe owner of the land, or of the estate subject to the special\\nlimitation, condition subsequent or agreement, in the furtherance of the\\nbenevolent, charitable, educational, public or religious purposes for\\nwhich the land is held;\\n  (d) whether the person or persons who would have a right of entry,\\npossessory estate resulting from the occurrence of a reverter, or right\\nto conveyance, reconveyance or surrender of the land or estate in the\\nevent of breach of the restriction at the time of the action will suffer\\nsubstantial damage by reason of extinguishment or modification of the\\nrestriction, and, in such event, whether damages or restitution of the\\nland, or its value, in whole or in part, should be awarded to such\\nperson or persons.\\n  4.

This section\\napplies to actions to enforce a covenant or agreement restricting the\\nuse of land or to recover damages for breach thereof, including an\\naction predicated on infringement of an easement or other interest\\ncreated by the covenant or agreement, to the extent that the restriction\\nrelates to structures that may be erected on the premises and limits\\nsuch structures with respect to set-back or sidelines, the area that may\\nbe built upon, the location, independent character or number of\\nstructures, height, or general purpose for which they shall be designed\\nor typically suited.\\n  2. An action to enforce the covenant or agreement by compelling the\\nremoval or alteration of a structure, or to recover damages for breach\\nof the covenant or agreement, or to recover damages for infringement of\\nan easement or other interest in the premises so restricted, cannot be\\nmaintained unless it is commenced (a) before the expiration of two years\\nfrom the completion of the structure concerned, or (b) before September\\none, nineteen hundred sixty-five, whichever shall be later.\\n  3. a. For the purposes of this section, where the breach of the\\nrestriction upon which the action is predicated consists of a\\nreplacement, enlargement or alteration of a previously existing\\nstructure which did not constitute or involve a violation of the\\nrestriction, or where a previously existing structure constituted a\\nviolation for which action is barred as provided in this section and a\\nreplacement, enlargement or alteration is made constituting or creating\\na different or more extensive violation, the completion of the\\nreplacement, enlargement or alteration shall be deemed the completion of\\nthe structure.\\n  b. The date of issuance of a certificate of occupancy or, if no such\\ncertificate shall have been issued, the date of actual occupancy of the\\nstructure or of the structure as replaced, enlarged or altered, shall be\\ndeemed the date of completion of the structure.\\n  4. The application of this section is not affected by any disability\\nor lack of knowledge on the part of any person, and is not affected by\\nthe fact that the person against whom the action might have been brought\\nwithin the period herein provided was during that time a non-resident or\\nabsent from the state.\\n  5. If an action governed by this section is not commenced within the\\ntime herein provided it shall be conclusively presumed that the right of\\naction for the relief for which that action might have been brought has\\nbeen released.\\n  6. Nothing in this section shall be construed in any manner to limit\\nany other statute or rule of law or equity by reason of which, at a date\\nprevious to the expiration of the period provided in this section, the\\nrestriction is or may be deemed extinguished or held unenforceable, or\\nunenforceable by judgment compelling the removal or alteration of a\\nstructure.\\n",
