The legislature hereby\\nfinds that in certain municipalities of the state there exists\\nsubstandard and unsanitary housing due to obsolescence, deterioration\\nand dilapidation of buildings which provide single room dwelling\\naccommodations; that there exists a need to provide safe and sanitary\\nsingle room dwelling accommodations for persons of low income who are\\nunable to live in self-contained apartments; that the present condition\\nis contrary to the public interest and threatens the health, safety,\\nwelfare, comfort and security of the people of the state; and that the\\npublic interest requires projects to provide for the reconstruction,\\nrehabilitation and improvement of such existing buildings. The\\nlegislature therefore finds that provision should be made for the\\nhousing trust fund corporation as established by section forty-five-a of\\nthe private housing finance law to contract with not-for-profit\\ncorporations for the accomplishment of such projects.\\n",
