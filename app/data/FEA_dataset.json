All payments of or on account of real estate taxes or assessments,\\nother than the proceeds of tax anticipation notes, shall be immediately\\nupon receipt deposited in such fund.

During the second and third months of each fiscal quarter, there\\nshall be retained in the fund, subject to the provisions of subdivision\\nthree of this section, all real estate tax payments deposited in the\\nfund until there shall have been retained from monies so deposited\\nduring such month an amount equal to the total monthly debt service,\\ncomputed as of the date of any disbursement of monies from the fund, for\\nthe first month of the next succeeding fiscal quarter; provided that\\nsuch amount shall be reduced by any amount already on deposit in the\\nfund which may be used to pay the monthly debt service for such month.\\n  c.

The board shall consider the impact of\\nearlier or larger retention of real estate tax receipts on the city's\\nseasonal borrowing requirements when determining whether it shall\\nrequire such additional retention or that other revenues or cash\\nresources of the city be paid into the fund.

Where such revenue consists of\\nstate aid or other revenue to be paid to the city by the comptroller, on\\nthe date such revenue is payable to the city, the comptroller shall\\ndeposit such revenue directly into such account in lieu of payment to\\nthe city.
