She is super sweet and spoils me with great food and she has sweet pets.\n\nI'm very ADHD with a lot of energy... I need a lot of stimulation. There is so much love here, and I am grateful, but this is not a great match. I'm really bored. I'm in a place where I don't know anyone, and there really isn't any way to meet other people here. I feel like I'm in isolation here. Even her street is a dead-end street, you never see anyone outside, no families just small apartments with mostly seniors.\n\nI usually get to spend time during the holidays with my younger cousins (kids, teens, 20s, early 30s) who are always busy and active, take me out with them, and there's constant back-and-forth banter... I love that and miss it bad. The companionship and they're super curious about my life and vice versa.  Video games with each other, hoops, wrestling and goofing around or just talking about life. It's very social and high key when I'm with them, no matter where we go or what we do.\n\nI feel guilty about feeling down this Christmas, and I know it shows. I really just need to find stuff to do so I can be in a better mood when I'm around my aunt. I feel like she could think I'm ungrateful or that she's done someone wrong. She already got frustrated with me and asked if \"I expect the world to entertain me.\" She thinks her quiet corner of the world is just perfect and can't understand why I would not feel the same way.\n\nI've tried going out to bars by myself and that is just no fun, also I'm not a drinker (as in 1 drink is enough.) Bars are fine with friends, but not solo. I've tried other solo excursions and just feel worse. Doing things by myself for the whole holiday season just isn't appealing. I am not great at approaching people and starting a conversation.\n\nA pleasant week for my aunt involves the grocery store, church, volunteering at her church, sitting at the library, taking the recycling to the drop-off center, and watching TV each night. It's insanely boring for me. Plus, she's very independent and doesn't need or want help shopping, cooking, cleaning, etc. I just have nothing useful or interesting to do.\n\nAny ideas? I'm within 80 minutes of Chicago downtown and within an hour of a lot of suburbs. I like sports in general, playing pool, pickup basketball (not good though), conversations about tech and news and sports. I'm game for anything where I could meet people who want to meet people, if that makes sense. I feel like I'm searching aimlessly and can \"try\" driving to all sorts of places, but holiday week hours are unpredictable and there's no guarantee it'll be worth the trip. I'm probably looking at 45-90 minutes of drive time, and my budget is limited, so I feel like I need to make good choices and not just be aimless about picking places to go.\n\nThanks!", "title": "Boredom in the suburbs"}, {"created_utc": 1577388421, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ChicagoSuburbs/comments/efzp0l/anyone_interested_in_splitting_a_grassfedpasture/", "id": "efzp0l", "is_self": true, "score": 1, "selftext": "I have currently been sold on all the  benefits of consuming grass fed/pasture cow beef over what is typically  available in the store.

Yes my friend has a vehicle but I'd really like to get use to taking the subway and moving/exploring the city alone when they're not available.

I currently live in an apartment in the loop on the same block as my office, which is an unbeatable commute, but I want to own a house, and that's not going to happen in the loop.  So I'm looking outward to the suburbs and further-out neighborhoods of Chicago. (Obviously all the in-person parts of my search are going to be delayed by Coronavirus.)\n\nI've gotten the advice that a real-estate agent will have a lot of information for us, but also that you should choose your agent based on the town/neighborhood you're moving to, so I guess first we need to choose a suburb/neighborhood.

I'm looking in the 250-350k range, reaching as high as 400k for the right place, so a neighborhood where that's realistic for a 2+ bed detached house.\n  4. We want somewhere there's enough space between houses that you don't feel like you're sharing a wall with your neighbor.  I've seen some neighborhoods with beautiful homes but &lt;10ft between the houses, and that's not what we're hoping for.\n  5. Demographics. We're both white and we just want to live somewhere the neighbors won't resent us as gentrifiers.  I've got no aversion at all to living in a diverse place, just don't want to move somewhere I will actually be or be percieved to be the reason folks who used to live there don't anymore.\n  6. We'd like a tall privacy fence around the backyard (dog people), so I guess I just don't want to go anywhere where the HOAs typically micromanage you to the point where you can't do that.\n\nOur current front runner-ish places are Des Plaines, Arlington Heights, and maybe Evanston?

Coal tar pitch has been linked to various cancers and other serious health conditions. In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, when residents of Illinois have been ordered to shelter in place, TapeCoat continues to unapologetically subject residents to their emissions.\n\nWe are subjected to the noxious smell of burning tar, rubber, and asphalt at all times of the day. Depending on how the wind blows, the smell is extremely intense to the point residents have to cover their noses and mouths to leave their homes. Residents are waking up with headaches on a daily basis and, at times, a mysterious metallic bad taste in their mouth. Neighbors have experienced mysterious illnesses, such as lung cancer, lesions, and respiratory issues. We are concerned to let our kids play in the backyard or the neighborhood park, kitty-corner from Tapecoat. The common denominator of these concerns is TapeCoat, owned by Chase Corp (NYSE: CCF) which is headquartered in Westwood, MA.\n\nWhile the effects of this process have been a concern for years, we have decided to shine a light on the potential impact of their emissions, in hopes of finally coming to a resolution. The main concern is the emission of asphalt fumes from the coating process. The residents want an answer to when this will end. Delaying this process on Tapecoat\u2019s end is only prolonging the suffering of the residents.\n\nWe are a diverse community - homes filled with families who have spent generations in Evanston, those who have recently moved here with young kids, and every point in between. We are a welcoming community that thrives on being good neighbors, and since our neighborhood is suffering from the actions of your company, we are organizing together. As a neighborhood, we will:\n\n* organize the entire Evanston community to attend City Councils meetings to address their concerns until this is resolved,\n* continue to collect data from neighbors on the time, dates and intensity of offensive, and potentially harmful, odors in the air,\n* expand the scope of our data collection to include any health impacts that may have been caused by these emissions,\n* continue to work with the City of Evanston (IL), the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency, and the Illinois Attorney General\u2019s office to supply this data for their review, and recommend enforcement of IEPA\u2019s Notice of Violation that TapeCoat recieved in Nov 2019, and\n* engage with various community and environmental protection groups to bring this issue further into the public\u2019s view.\n\nFor Chase Corp, TapeCoat may simply be a source of revenue, but for our neighborhood, it is about the health of our kids, parents, and grandparents, who breathe in the after effects of those revenues.

Personally I'd rather take my risks with the Rona than be the first to take a vaccine that was rushed out.\n\nI'm calling for civil disobedience. Sure exercise some common sense, keep your distance, I'd even cave to wearing a mask despite thinking they aren't that affective and actually cause people to touch their face 100x as much as without one, but I'd even be up for that.\n\nI'm calling for others who agree to open their businesses, get together with friends and family, go to parks. They can't stop us all, there's power in numbers.\n\nThose who are terrified are more than welcome to stay at home and those who are in an at risk group should probably stay at home as well. The rest of us can get back to work, open our businesses, and support those who can't come out. If you're house had termites would you burn down the house or take a more surgical approach and target the problem area? Staying shut down is burning down the house.\n\nIf anyone decides to open back up I'll be the first to frequent your busienss and help support you and your business.\n\nI will no longer be a part of this insanity and hope others will join me\n\nEnd of rant", "title": "Time For Civil Disobedience"}, {"created_utc": 1587739992, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ChicagoSuburbs/comments/g79r4i/best_credit_union/", "id": "g79r4i", "is_self": true, "score": 1, "selftext": "What local credit unions/banks do you all use and enjoy?

I had a mask on, and a mask for him in my bag. We waited outside in line for about 25 minutes when a (very rude) older gentleman approached us and told us we wouldn\u2019t be able to get in unless my son put a mask on. \n\nI bought him a box of Mickey Mouse masks hoping it would help ease him into wearing one. But he wouldn\u2019t. He wouldn\u2019t put it on and the one I had for him - he ripped off his face as I was trying to put it on him since we were being scolded and it landed right in a dirty puddle. I explained to the guy that my son has special needs and he told me I had to get out of line and leave. \n\nI understand there is rules and we are all trying to deal with this pandemic but the way he called me out and continued to argue and embarrass me and then told me I should start paying more attention to the news because Tinley Parks face covering went into effect before Chicago - but I do not live in Tinley Park, I just go to Sams Club there. To make matters worse, I was only going there to get ONE item. I almost waited 30 minutes and was talked to like I was garbage for one item. \n\nI got in my car and bawled my eyes all the way home. I don\u2019t have family here, and my struggles with my son is nobody else\u2019s fault... just sad the lack of compassion.
