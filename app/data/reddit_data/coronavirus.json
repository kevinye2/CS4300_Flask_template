Just 100 years ago, a simple skin infection could turn into raging sepsis and death.\n\nIf you're unable or unwilling to visit a medical provider after SHTF, having abx at your location could literally mean the difference between life and death.\n\nMy wife is an ER doctor, and she provided me with a list of abx to order on line. It is impractical, unethical, and perhaps even illegal for a physician to write multiple excessive scripts for abx on a prophylactic basis - and as such, she is unable/unwilling to write for these. Instead, I have ordered them from a fish medication website (which despite their warnings that these are not for human consumption, it is an understood workaround for people to obtain human-grade abx without a script).\n\nHere is the list of abx she recommended I order:\n\nAmoxicillin 500mg. (100-200 tabs)\n\nKeflex 500 mg (100-200 tabs)\n\nClindamycin 150mg (300-400 tabs)\n\nSulfa 800/160mg (100-200 tabs)\n\nMetronidazole 500mg (30-60 tabs)\n\nDoxy 100 mg (100-200 tabs)\n\nFluconazole 100 mg (30 tabs)\n\nCiprofloxacin 500 mg (100 tabs)\n\nAzithromycin 250mg (60 tabs)\n\nThese are not cheap. If you can find a doc that will write you a script for any/all of these, great! The price at Krogers (using just goodrx or their in-house discount card) is about 1/3 the cost of buying them online w/o a script. But, if you're dying of a simple, curable infection, the cost will seem trivial.\n\nSince application of the correct abx for a given infection is essential, if you choose to self-medicate, please research which abx is appropriate for a given type of infection. For example, keflex is typically used to treat post-surgical or skin infections.\n\nI was able to find all of these at [fishmoxfishflex.com](https://fishmoxfishflex.com/).

The Hubei providence of China has an estimated population of 59 million.\nhttps://www.citypopulation.de/en/china/cities/hubei/\n\n2.  There\u2019s 1,423 confirmed cases of coronavirus in Hubei as of the time of my posting.\nhttps://hub.jhu.edu/2020/01/23/coronavirus-outbreak-mapping-tool-649-em1-art1-dtd-health/\n\n3. Hubei has an estimated hospital bed rate of 2.55 bed per 1000 people. \nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/www.bbc.com/news/amp/world-asia-51224504\n\n4. Of these Hubei hospital beds, there\u2019s said to be a 92.7% bed occupancy, leaving a 7.3% availability.\nhttps://www.statista.com/statistics/225528/bed-occupancy-rate-in-chinese-hospitals-by-region/\n\nBy using these statistics we can find the approximate amount of hospital beds (HBs) in Hubei.\n\n59,000,000 / 1000 = 59,000\n59,000 (2.55) = 150,450 = Total HBs in Hubei\n150,450 (0.073) = ~10,983 = Available HBs in Hubei\n\nSo.. generally there\u2019s bed space for around 11 thousand patients at any given moment in Hubei, yet hospitals in the Hubei providence have corpses laying in hallways? They can\u2019t even spare a room as a temporary morgue? \nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=3EBztQFRts8\n\nBeds for 11 thousand patients, all filled.

I live a 10 hour drive from Wuhan, but people are being affected everywhere in China except for one province, if I'm not mistaken.  I am currently living in China as an Au Pair. For the CNY, my host family wanted to spend the 2 weeks celebrating at their villa which is about an hour outside of the city. I had heard about the coronavirus once before we left but I hadn't thought much of it. No one really did until a few days ago. My host mom came to me and told me that we would be staying at the villa for awhile longer until things get better because it is safer here. Their villa is inside of a gated community and the property management announced yesterday that no one is allowed inside and that if we need something they will have it safely delivered. I thought that was strange since i'm sure that if an infected person were to touch our goods then it's kind of useless to do that, right ?  I don't know how many of you have seen the video of the nurse from Wuhan admitting that the real number of those infected is 90k or more, but for those of you that haven't, you should watch it. I showed this video to my host mom and she said that many Chinese people had already seen it. She didn't say whether she believed the claim or not, but her face said it all. I absolutely believe it. If this virus is as contagious as they're saying it is then I think there is no way the number of people infected in China has only reached 3,000 since the start of all of this back in December. Everyone is taking this very seriously here. The children that I teach English to, their school has been closed until February 17th and if this gets worse, i'm sure they'll be closed much longer. None of us have left the villa for about a week now. If anyone is interested in any updates, I'd be glad to come on here and share.

I feel as if everybody basically wants this to turn into a serious pandemic and for all of us to die opposed to us all relaying valid information and helping eachother stay healthy.\n\nHere are real questions that everybody wants to know..\n\n1) The US hasn't introduced any cases in the past few days. Sure, a lot are being watched but they all are quarantined. Do you guys actually forsee an outbreak in the states? If so, why?\n\n2) Most of us on this subreddit are young, probably in our 20s-40s. If we don't have any medical issues, is it really anything to worry about? I've seen time and time again that it really only seriously effects those with weak immune systems and the elderly.\n\n3) What are some actual good sources to follow? I feel as if CNN and other news stations are just trying to boost view rates..\n\n4) Personally I'm plant based and never get sick. I am really ramping up the vitamins, probiotics, and oil of oregano. Will this stuff actually build up my immune system against this virus or will it not since it's a completely different virus that we have never seen before?\n\nI think people want to know these answers above!\\^ (Atleast 1-3).\n\nHope the answers to this post help people!

This post is for information only and I do not seem to push and product, brand or marketplace.\n\nAs many of you know N95 masks filter 95% of everything as small as 0.3 microns. That's pretty impressive and it's definitely better than nothing but it might not be enough to prevent you from contracting the virus. While I don't know what size the Wuhan virus is, a quick Google search revealed that Coronavirus as a category range from 0.1 to 0.2 microns. Which means there's probably a decent chance that even a perfectly fitted N95 mask might not filter out the virus.\n\nI personally chose to splurge and buy a more expensive respirator and P100 filter cartridges that are rated to filter out 99.97% of everything as small as 0.3 microns. That extra 4.97% is going to help me rest easier. Also the respirator seals to your face far more securely than a N95 mask. Buying both the respirator and filter cartridges cost me a little over $30 online.\n\nAs a side note with the run to purchase N95 masks they're quickly becoming harder and more expensive to buy.\n\nFinal note: I originally made this post two days ago and it was removed by a moderator with no reason given.

I am expressing this with extreme calmness and steadfastness. \n\nI am in the middle of a storm. I am well aware, that everything I say must be rational and clear. \n\nI don't need you to ask me how I am\u2026 I\u2019m fine, I am at home in Wuhan. I don't go outdoors, and I have everything I need. But I cannot ignore the wails of this city. \n\nThey sing and dance on TV, but this city is paralyzed. The streets are empty, all that\u2019s left is the sound of the ambulance. I have dreamt, many times of an apocalypse, but never one so tranquil. \n\nThere\u2019s a man in the hospital lobby, sitting. He is already dead. I cannot tell you how I saw him. He cannot even be counted into the death toll. All around are people, waiting, for fate to grant them a chance of having the testing kit. \n\nThere is a man around forty years old. He took his IV outside of the hospital, in the cold wind. He found a wooden stick for the bottle. He cried, saying that he had had meals with his family\u2026 if he is infected, they might be as well. \n\nThose who are wealthy can take their IV inside a car. They don't have to wander in the night. \n\nI love the people of this country. The old scavenger who donates money, the nurse on the frontline, the drivers volunteering to take the doctors to and from work. All those volunteers, those construction workers who cannot get a decent rest, those abroad that donate money and supplies. The more I love you, the more I cannot stop crying. \n\nI know that not for long this country will again be all peaceful and prosperous, we will hear the united cries of the people, we will be so proud of our wealth and strength, and we will sing and praise the braveries of this day. But I who have witnessed those stories, I refuse to hear the applause or the praise. \n\nI only hope you will remember all the pains and wails this city has experiences. Tens of thousands of families. If you want numbers, I can tell you this. All those lights not on, they symbolize 5 kilos of tears. All those pain.. they should not be forgotten. \n\nMothers give birth to their children, then the children speak their first words, they work so hard at school, and they work diligently, they try to save up money for a house, all for their safety and peacefulness. All of this, all of this is ended by despair, engulfed in the abyss. Who can repay them? \n\nI don't want to talk about politics of power. I know my limits. But I don't want you guys to forget all of those who are in misery, admist all the voices. \n\nWe have been obedient all of our lives. We can stay in line for 10 hours to wait for a number at a hospital. We can stand the quarantine, we can stay in our homes. We can even stay silent. \n\nWe have given up all our rights, for protection. \n\nBut every day since the crisis, I have understood that, there is no survivor under a dark sky. \n\nThank you for reading this.

Family and I are healthy and well. We\u2019ve just got home from another food run so we\u2019re well prepared for another 4 days at least. I\u2019ve gotten many questions regarding the quarantine/nCOV but like I said, we\u2019ve stayed home away from the hospitals so I can\u2019t tell you what the actual number of cases are or how bad the situation really is because I just don\u2019t know. All I know is what the CCP tells us and as of now that I am writing this, the numbers are as follows:\n \nConfirmed cases: 11889\nSuspected cases: 17988\nCured cases: 275\nTotal death: 259\nNote the number of deaths might be much higher because if you died before you get to see a doctor and get a proper diagnosis, you won\u2019t be included in the count. And given the severe lack of medical professionals and testing kits I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the number is higher. That being said, we are receiving help everyday. Supplies are being flown into the city and volunteers are coming from all over china to help. I can\u2019t say if the situation is entirely under control, I really don\u2019t know, but we are receiving a lot of help.\n \nNow back to what prompted me to speak out in the first place. Since then, I\u2019ve been receiving heaps of messages from people sharing with me their experiences of racism, many of them are not even Chinese. What started as just Sinophobia has evolved into something that affects not just Chinese but the Asian community as a whole.\n \nWhat follows might not be politically correct so go on at your own risk\n \nMultiple countries have banned flights to/from China. This I don\u2019t see as racial discrimination. Statistical discrimination maybe, but not racial. Race, actually it seems more like travel history disguised as \u2018race\u2019, is used as an information carrier. And that\u2019s okay. A govt\u2019s priority is to protect their own citizens and if you know there\u2019s an epidemic outbreak in china rn the easiest and perhaps most effective solution is to ban all flights. Calls have been made for travellers who have recently been to china to self-quarantine for 14 days. I don\u2019t see this as racist either. But at the same time, we have to acknowledge that nCOV has been racialised much more than say H1N1 in 2009 that originated from the US and killed more than 12000 people in US alone. I don\u2019t recall anyone racialising H1N1 then? No one called it an \u2018American virus\u2019. Yes, nCOV originated from China, but it\u2019s not a \u2018Chinese virus\u2019. Just like how H1N1 isn\u2019t an \u2018American virus\u2019 or Ebola a \u2018Congo virus\u2019. The nCOV isn\u2019t a trait of the Chinese people.\n \nI also don\u2019t recall people saying how people with H1N1/Ebola \u2018deserve it because of US/Congo govt\u2019s actions in xyz\u2019, or \u2018that\u2019s what you get for eating weird animals\u2019. Like I\u2019ve said before, I didn\u2019t intend for this to be a political discussion. But it seems like everything is politicised these days. I just wanted to shed light on all the good things to humanise the situation. I\u2019m sorry if you\u2019ve had bad experiences with Chinese tourists. Living overseas, so have I. Many times. It\u2019s probably due to growth in the Chinese economy/advances in technology exceeding its cultural developments many times over. I agree this is something Chinese citizens have to work on but something like that isn\u2019t going to happen overnight. And remember there are 1.3 Billion Chinese. Even if only 0.1% are irresponsible and selfish that\u2019s still 1.3million people (bigger than the population of Iceland lol), and that\u2019s enough for foreigners to form an opinion about.\n \nLast thing, I was going back on forth if I should add this last bit since I know I\u2019ll just get attacked even more, but fuck it. For those accusing me of being complicit in this crime by not speaking out about it before, and therefore deserve it. Stop it. I\u2019m perhaps in china for a couple weeks max every year since I was 5. So ya forgive me if I am not aware of the incidences, or some of you even argue the culture, of eating bats and mice. Forgive me for ever only going to normal supermarkets like millions of other Chinese for groceries so I\u2019ve never ran into weird live animals in cages nor even aware of their existence. It\u2019s not like they\u2019re in supermarkets all over the country. I reckon you have to go out of your way to look for them or else you wouldn\u2019t know about it. And if you\u2019re going out of your way to look for them, you\u2019re probably involved in the trade one way or another so why would you report it????? So forgive me if I\u2019ve never spoken up about it before. I don\u2019t spend enough time here to be aware of it, nor do I have enough time on my hands to be a full-time social justice warrior trying to right every wrong I see. And maybe you think they\u2019re all excuses but honestly, idgaf. I am currently drafting a letter proposing for the permanent ban of wildlife trade in china and looking into ways of sending that letter so that it\u2019ll actually be read and taken seriously. I hope you are also doing something to stop the fkd up shit that\u2019s going on in your own country. If not, shut up and stop accusing me of being complicit to a crime that I wasn\u2019t even aware of when you are doing fuck all about whatever\u2019s going on in your own country.\n \nI do hope this will encourage more constructive criticisms than just hate. You may say \u2018free speech\u2019, and you\u2019re right. Go for it, say whatever you like I won\u2019t report any comments no matter how hateful/mean. But expect me to stand up for myself and fight back.\n \nPs. I posted a second update on fb if you\u2019re keen to read it. But I thought I should post this here since reddit is better for a more open and in-depth discussion. An open and civil discussion is always more constructive than just pointless name calling. I sincerely hope the mods will not disable the comment section or delete \u201chateful\u201d comments.

Since the first outbreak of SARS in the early 2000s, SARS has been making small reappearances around China every few years/months but is swiftly contained as well as any and all information about it. Seeing the threat this poses to it's citizens and more importantly the communist party a vaccine needs to be produced. But there's a problem: if all of a sudden China starts doing a mass vaccination campaign, suspicion will arise in and outside of China and this would ruin previous cover ups. So a plan is made: to create a virus like SARS but with 0% mortality rate that would effectively imunize anyone who contacts it. Why do this? Well it removes the need to vaccinate everyone (so no questioning the cover ups, and it's free!) And with flu like symptoms people would just stay home a day or two and be fine and end up being imunized against SARS. The virus would be designed to spread as much as possible to imunize everyone as fast as possible. The perfect plan! So the SARS virus is modified in the Wuhan lv4 security virus and bacterial research lab (for those who don't know the coronavirus contains genes that are not likely to arise naturally) Tests are done on a limited amount of people to avoid spreading too much information and everything seems to be working fine! So, a month ago a number of people are contaminated on purpose to help the disease/vaccine spread. Doctors start seeing a small amount of people get very sick and try to warn others, but the Chinese government thinking that these severe cases of coronavirus are outliers try to silence the information to keep spreading it. Large events are not cancelled because the goal is to spread it as far as possible. Soon enough the Chinese government realises that the death rate is way higher than expected and start reacting, but it's too late. Hundreds of thousands are contaminated and the government go's back to doing what they know how to do: covering up incidents. Note the timing, the coronavirus appeared before the Chinese new years.

Travel is increased during this period and would help the disease spread more.", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/exbbam/theory_coronavirus_is_supposed_to_be_a_vaccine/", "created_utc": 1580585670}, {"id": "exc2bx", "title": "The \u201cDoctor\u2019s Note\u201d rule in workplaces is going to get Americans killed.", "selftext": "1.

Some are fully engaged and consuming every spec of information. But many seem to be ignoring the situation completely. Why?\n\nThis is basically a grieving scenario. People are suffering and dying. The obvious fear is the virus might impact me. The individual. My family and loved ones. My friends and neighbors. \n\nThe first step of grieving is shock and denial. This can't be happening. It can't be real. It won't be that bad. There will be a cure. There will be a vaccine. \n\nThe vast majority of people seem to be stuck at this point, at least for now. There will be growing numbers moving past this stage over time, as the situation continues to evolve.\n\nYou can't analyze data you don't have.

Received an email today that all company travel to China has been banned until March. It's hard to overstate how big of a deal this is. Business stops at nothing- holidays, life events, terror attacks, weather disasters- I've seen the machine operate through it all. I've never once in my 20 year career seen a corporation pull the plug like this, let alone to China, which has been the single biggest focus of global capitalism for years now.\n\nTo those saying \"the flu is a much bigger deal\", I completely agree. The official numbers reported are a tiny fraction of what the global system endures during flu season every year. So that begs the question-- why are all these completely unprecedented actions being taken? Complete corporate pull outs, global travel freezes, rapid construction of new hospitals...why? 14k cases and 300 deaths statistically comes nowhere close to prompting these actions, especially in a population of almost 2B. And not for nothing, we have a global healthcare system that readily absorbs hundreds of thousands of serious flu cases annually. Even noteworthy flu spikes come nowhere close to prompting reactions like this. \n\nMoreso than nationstates, corporations are the real power of this age, and business is the unifying global empire (this isn't meant to sound critical- simply a fact. Global business has helped usher in a long period of relative peace and prosperity...). Keep an eye on what big corporations do. If the rich and power take a pause from business activities, it is a huge sign that something extraordinary is happening.

Many factors are completely unknown at this early stage.", "selftext": "You can't determine the mortality rate of an illness at the beginning of an outbreak. The 2% estimate is only an estimate - barely better than guessing. Consider the following factors we don't fully know yet:\n\n1. We don't know how many people have stayed at home with mild cases that have recovered or aren't going to die. The larger this number, the lower the mortality rate. Ask yourself - did you go to the doctor the last time you had the flu? If you answered \"No\", you wouldn't be counted in any count of current confirmed cases. Huge numbers of people probably stayed at home. Of those people, the only way they get counted is if they die, further inflating the mortality rate numbers. This is the single most important factor at this stage.\n\n2. We don't know yet what the demographic profile is of people currently being treated. If the people in the hospital are primarily elderly patients, that will suggest the mortality rate is much lower than 2%, as most folks that didn't get hospital beds or stayed at home would be less likely to die than elderly patients. Elderly patients had a 50% mortality rate during the SARS epidemic, as compared to the ~9% mortality rate for younger patients. If the overall mortality rate is 2%, it might be 10% in elderly patients.\n\n3. We don't know the \"bandwidth\" available for testing kits in China. If there are fewer testing kits and hospital staff available than there are new cases each day, the mortality rate will appear to be higher than it is. \n\n4. It's possible the Chinese govt is fudging the numbers - if this is the case, the mortality rates will be higher than stated. However, the fact that only one patient has died outside of China is an encouraging sign. \n\n5. Treatment protocols are still evolving. The flu would have a much higher mortality rate without modern medical care. New treatment protocols are under development (notably antiretroviral therapy).\n\n6. People still haven't had time to recover from the illness that have been admitted to the hospital, meaning they will be counted as a case but not as a death (even if they are likely to die). This will push the mortality rate up. However, keep in mind that people typically die early in the progression of this disease after symptoms appear. Most people that die from coronavirus (including my father, who died due to a normal \"common cold\" coronavirus-induced heart failure in 2017) are elderly and suffer from pneumonia quite early. \n\nAll things considered, unless you believe the Chinese govt is hiding thousands of deaths, the mortality rate is almost certainly going to be at or lower than 2%. \n\nAll that said, this is still a serious pandemic and we now have a new flu-like illness making the rounds. If you are young and healthy, you probably don't have much to fear personally. It is still too early to make conclusions - if you live outside China and you are young, the best thing you can do is stay informed and get your flu shot.

This has the potential to save many lives if acted upon. It was posted earlier but barely got any comments, probably not as much fun as wild speculation or dramatic predictions but this is the type of thing we should be looking for. \n\nI read through the linked paper with some skepticism but couldn't find too much wrong with it.\n\nA  few note, probably best not to do this with an N95/N99/N100 mask, they  use activated charcoal and salt will block up the pores and make the  carbon useless.  Also will probably be really hard to breath through  since the salt will block the air path. Note that they indicate that the  method of action is mechanical - crystallisation mechanically damaging  the structure of the virus and desiccation also causing damage to the  virus. Probably best not to mess with that action by adding anything  else like antibacterial sprays or alcohol based liquids.\n\nThey  mention using a  surfactant so adding a tiny amount of soap/washing  liquid would probably help. They also discuss how it works at a certain  relative humidity (RH):\n\n*\"  Notably, for demonstration of the concept of salt-recrystallization   based virus deactivation system, NaCl salt was used, which has a   critical RH of 75% at 30\u2009\u00b0C*[*35*](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep39956#ref-CR35)*.   However, salts with higher critical RH can be easily used, such as   ammonium sulfate, potassium chloride and potassium sulfate, which have   critical RH of 80%, 84% and 96.3% at 30\u2009\u00b0C, respectively*[*35*](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep39956#ref-CR35)*. This suggests that salt-coated filters may be developed for specific environmental conditions.\"*\n\nI  would suggest it might be worth considering using potassium sulfate  instead of table salt if you think you might encounter humidity higher  than 75%. Personally I'm considering using regular salt on the middle  membrane and potassium sulfate and potassium chloride on the outer  membranes of a surgical mask. I would then put this into the mask  together with a regular N95 filter to provide 4 levels of protection.  Properly fitted together with other precautions like regular hand/face  washing and cotton gloves, should provide a fairly optimal level of  protection. Goggles may also help but may be uncomfortable. I suspect it  to be a gradual ramp up with initially simple mask and as numbers grow,  further levels added.", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/eypczi/treatment_of_mask_based_on_research/", "created_utc": 1580819492}, {"id": "eyporf", "title": "The only thing scary about this is how contagious it is.

First I have a collection of scales to present to you. A more technical document may be generated later, but I am obscenely ill. I\u2019ve had a nasty cough, nausea, and a plethora of other nasty symptoms. So the more technical document may take more time, or an infinite amount of time, depending on the circumstances.  \n\n\n**Sample Properties**\n\nThe sample was comprised of 206 responses. The sample was approximately 50% Male, 50% Female, and 0% Other. The sample was comprised primarily from people in the USA. The sample had an average age of 33.45, with a standard deviation of 11.94. Knowledge and concern comparisons were conducted across countries and gender, no significant differences emerged. No significant differences emerged when considering participant age.\n\n**Technical Properties of the Scales**  \n \n\n**Corona Virus Attitudes Scales**  \n After some data analytics, I managed to create two scales  for measuring Corona Virus attitudes with gorgeous reliabilities. The first scales is a Generalized Fear of Corona Virus (Alpha = .91, 5 Items) and a second scale for measuring Personal Health Concerns of the Corona Virus (Al;pha=.85 , 3 Items). The scales had less than ideal factor structure (RMSEA=.1-.8), but were close enough for me to be content with them. Their reliability also means I am fairly happy with the scales.  \n \n\n**Generalized Fear of Corona Virus \\[Alpha = .91\\]**  \n \n\n(1-6 Likert Type Scale, 1 Strongly Disagree, 2 Disagree, 3 \u2013 Slightly Disagree, 4 \u2013 Slightly Agree, 5 \u2013 Agree, 6 \u2013 Strongly Agree)\n\nI am concerned about the Novel Corona Virus.  \nI am afraid of the Novel Corona Virus.  \nThe Novel Corona Virus is nothing to be worried about. \\[Reverse Coded\\]  \nI have faith in humanity's ability to deal with the Novel Corona Virus. \\[Reverse Coded\\]  \nThe Novel Corona Virus will be easily contained. \\[Reverse Coded\\]\n\n**Personal Health Concerns of Corona Virus \\[Alpha = .85\\]**  \n \n\n(1-6 Likert Type Scale, 1 Strongly Disagree, 2 Disagree, 3 \u2013 Slightly Disagree, 4 \u2013 Slightly Agree, 5 \u2013 Agree, 6 \u2013 Strongly Agree)\n\nI think the Novel Corona Virus may harm some of the people I know.  \nI am afraid the Novel Corona Virus may harm me.  \nI doubt the Novel Corona Virus will harm anyone I know. \\[Reverse Coded\\]\n\n**Corona Virus Knowledge Scale**\n\nThe Corona Virus knowledge scale that was generated had much lower reliability. This makes sense, I have very little experience making knowledge tests. Be that as it were, 4 items had to be dropped because they were negatively correlated with the overall knowledge score. After dropping the bad knowledge items, alpha was still not in acceptable ranges (Alpha=.5). A proportion of the sample also failed to answer the knowledge test for whatever reason, so the final sample size for all knowledge test results is 164-165.\n\n**What this means, is that you should take results looking at the effects of knowledge of the corona virus on beliefs about the corona virus with a grain of salt.** Actual relationships may not be as they appear due to the poor reliability of the knowledge scale. Future work should attempt to build better knowledge scales, and see if similar patterns to those reported later in this post form.  \n\n\nThe final knowledge scale is not presented here, because I am tired, and also because its psychometric properties are less than ideal.\n\n**The Effects of Knowledge on Corona Virus Attitudes**\n\nThe primary thing I was interested in for this study, was what the effects of knowledge of the corona virus had on an individuals attitudes towards the virus. As stated above, you should take the following results with large grains of salt. The knowledge scale that was used had poor reliability, and therefore may result in poor estimation of the actual underlying relationship. Consider these results as preliminary at best.  \n \n\nThe aforementioned caveats on the table, polynomial regression was performed, with the number of questions someone got right on the knowledge test as the predictor and someone\u2019s generalized level of fear as the dependent variable. The results were significant, both with and without an outlier. The curve best modelling the relationship is summarized in the picture presented below, both with and without the outlier: (R-Squared =.14, acceptable for the social sciences)  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/enl2c6afz0f41.png?width=861&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a76e7a18aeab1ea1aa0eae5fc9afc5af5986eea9\n\nPolynomial regression was also attempted to model the relationship between knowledge of the Corona Virus and Personal Concerns about the Corona Virus. Polynomial regression found that the best line modeling the relationship was a straight increasing line. Graphs display both with and without the outlier (R-Squared = .07, acceptable for the social sciences)  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pf8ipq2qz0f41.png?width=861&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=96ef3289ca273c401b43d6ac1722cef29e1c2f35\n\nThat is all for now. As I am able, I will provide more results.

Currently as of February 5Th there are about 25.000 infected and about 500 deaths. This would make the fatality rate around 2%. That is assuming however that China is not being misleading with the number that have died. There is definitely way more infected than just the 25,000 confirmed cases. That number is probably over 100,000 at this point going off of previous estimates. So 500/100,000 would make the death rate .01% or close to what the common flu is. The scary part is how infectious the disease is especially during the incubation period.

What is a novel coronavirus?**\n\nA coronavirus is actually the name for a set of illnesses, including the common cold and other respiratory infections. A novel coronavirus means it\u2019s a new virus that originated in animals, but has jumped to humans. This particular virus from Wuhan is being called the 2019 novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**How does the Wuhan coronavirus spread?**\n\nSo far, there\u2019s limited information about the Wuhan novel coronavirus, including how easy it is to spread and how dangerous it is. But we know the virus can be transmitted from person to person and it is passed by coughing and other close contact.\n\nClose contact is a vague term that means a lot of things to different people. But in this case, it specifically means being within about six feet of someone for a prolonged period of time without wearing recommended personal protective equipment such as a disposable face mask. It could also be having direct contact with infectious secretions of someone who has a case of the virus (for example: being coughed on) while not wearing personal protective equipment.\n\nThat can sound scary, but it\u2019s important to know that influenza is also transmitted the same way.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Is this coronavirus deadly?**\n\nThe numbers of how many people have been diagnosed or how many have died are changing rapidly. Without accurate numerators and denominators, the jury\u2019s still out. That said, we do know that more than 100 people in China have died from this virus. Based on the information I\u2019m seeing, it looks very similar to SARS in a number of ways \u2014 except for the fact that it\u2019s likely less deadly, but more transmittable.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**What are the symptoms of the virus?**\n\nWe\u2019re still learning more about Wuhan novel coronavirus, but we know it typically causes flu-like symptoms including a fever, cough and congestion. Some patients \u2014 particularly the elderly and others with other chronic health conditions \u2014 develop a severe form of pneumonia.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**How do you treat patients with this virus? Can you vaccinate against it?**\n\nThings like antibiotics are designed to kill bacteria, not a virus. So typically doctors can treat the symptoms, but not the virus itself. There\u2019s no vaccine yet.", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/ez9dvs/megathread/", "created_utc": 1580908497}, {"id": "ez9y34", "title": "How do you feel the progression of this virus will be in 8 months?

It is extremely interesting when it comes to the corona virus because if you set up the air purifier in rooms where many gather at the same time, you can help many who do not get sick. Where many people gather, the humidity also rises rapidly.\n\nWhen electrons are released into the air, they, together with oxygen and water vapor, form hydrogen peroxide, a simple water-like molecule that the body uses to kill viruses.\u201d\n\nUpdate:\nSource (behind pay wall)\n\nhttps://www.sla.se/2020/02/05/skas-lakare-effektiv-luftrenare-som-dodar-coronavirus/", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/ezal83/swedish_doctor_electrostatic_air_purification/", "created_utc": 1580914032}, {"id": "ezaz9l", "title": "R0 of the Coronavirus - official numbers vs. anecdotal evidence", "selftext": "Officially, the Chinese Heath service has called the R0 of the Coronavirus 2 to 2.5. \n\nR0 is the number of people an infected individual will infect during their illness.

It\u00b4s still to early to tell but it seems that it\u00b4s not as virulent as SARS but it\u00b4s more contagious. And this is why China is locking up entire cities...SARS death rate was \\~10% of the total number of infected and with nCov we are lookig for \\~2%-3% of deaths (even with the statistics predictions that the number of infected/dead is actually much higher), however it\u00b4s still to early to tell, so if nCov is more contagious imagine if we loose control of the spreading and China ends up with 100 million people infected (which is aprox 7.2% of China population) at this rate we are looking 2-3 million people dead, and this brings us to another topic which is hospital care capacity, China is locking cities up not because this is some world ending virus but because they now know the spreading capacity of this particular virus and the effects that it can cause, on their people and on their economy.\n\nNow imagine that we can\u00b4t control the outbreak and more and more people are being infected this will load the hospitals more and more (which is what is already happening in China), there will be thousands (or millions) of people that will not have hospital care and if they can\u00b4t recover by themselves will die and the death rate will go up (vastly), and so the 2-3 million that i was talking about will sky rocket.\n\nAnd this is probably the most important aspect of a virus! Contain it Contain it! Hospitals are already crowded and if the outbreak is not contained the hospitals will collapse fast. That\u00b4s why containment is so important, thats why China is locking up entire cities. China is most likely hiding the real number of infected, but i think that they lost a bit of the control over the outbreak and they don\u00b4t know the real number either but for sure, it\u00b4s bigger then the \"official\" one.\n\nSo to resume...\n\n*  Yes this is a serious issue! but there is no reason to panic or start building bunkers, as i saw a user here say \"just do what feels right to do\", if there are reported cases in your city maybe you start using a mask, maybe you wash your hands more often, maybe start covering your nose with your arm when you sneeze instead of your hands...i\u00b4m no doctor or medical professional but this are measures that are available everywhere now, and they greatly reduce the probability of the virus transmission.\n* Decreasing of the number of infected people on day by day it\u00b4s one of if not the most important things to achieve, before it takes huge proportions.\n* There are almost 0 (i say almost because Hong Kong and Phillipines have dead cases) dead, in other countries besides China so this means that most countries are handling the situation well for now and the infected people aren\u00b4t recovered yet but they are taking care of them, i think that this means that we can effectively fight the virus, and China is losing people because they lost a bit of control over the situation (as you can expect in a country with &gt;1 billion people) and now hospitals are full and doctors literally die because of overwork.\n\nTL;DR: China might be hiding the real numbers, but they are not locking entire cities because of a \"bio weapon\" world ending issue.", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/ezeqty/my_pov_on_the_ncov_until_now/", "created_utc": 1580930391}, {"id": "ezfd5v", "title": "Reports from doctors in ICU", "selftext": "I have a friend in the USA who has friends who are doctors working in the Coronavirus ICU in Wuhan.

Before I continue - I know some people may not have access to all the right resources, but for those who do:\n\nStock up on the right vitamins.  Build your immune system like a complete anti viral warhorse by exercising eternal vigilance on reaching your intakes of vitamins every day.  \nVit C, D3, Zinc etc \n\nFruit + vegetables.  Get your body into the most alkaline state that you can.  Diseases cannot survive in an alkaline environment.  Lay off the most acidic foods such as meat + bread, and focus on consuming foods high in nutritional value.\n\nSleep.  Get your 8 hours of sleep a night.  This is where my above comment comes into play - we all have different lives and some of us may not have the privilege of a good nights sleep - but fight for your 8 hours a night where you can. Any less than 6 hours a night has a dramatic effect on your immune system. \n\nWater.  Drink it like your life depends on it - because it does.  \n\nI\u2019m not trying to convert everyone to veganism, I believe everyone is entitled to their own beliefs and ways of life - however it cannot be denied that a stronger immune system will give you the best chance at surviving a pandemic, as well as all the other preparations mentioned in this sub.  \n\nTake care of your body - you only ever get to own one.", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/ezjw9n/one_of_the_most_important_defence_mechanisms/", "created_utc": 1580950188}, {"id": "ezjxkg", "title": "Of course this sub would post nothing about the potential treatment coming out of China", "selftext": "Stock market soared today good news coming out of China but y\u2019all don\u2019t trust them to a fault and the report said it could begin testing as of next week come on guys let\u2019s have some positivity here I don\u2019t know how to link things here but a quick google search will provide sources also I understand that it might be fabricated but let\u2019s hope it\u2019s not", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/ezjxkg/of_course_this_sub_would_post_nothing_about_the/", "created_utc": 1580950343}, {"id": "ezkjk9", "title": "Theorizing about people on the streets", "selftext": "I'm reading and watching a lot about this - so I know that it's not a joke.\n\nBut what just came to my mind - if I can stand in line for hours and nobody will look at me, why would I then not just go and drop on the floor, play unconscious or dead? \n\nThey care more/faster about bodies on the floor than people in line...\n\nJust thought that after I've seen some videos with people laying on the floor straight, with arms along their body..

Some examples include the many that they have initiated in Africa, since I am happy to hear that after all these decades of them having had numerous struggles they are finally finding a direction towards prosperity because of China's interest in the continent.

And then there's the coronavirus that hit China and is spreading across the world.

He's been posting live videos since the beginning of this quarantine, and has given many news interviews. He is with his wife in the cabin and both report no symptoms. But with this new batch of positives today, I'm worried that we're now watching these people become symptomatic. They really have seemed fine. Today, Sally has started coughing. You can hear her in the background. He's been posting today about every hour and at first it was only once or twice during the video, but this last video she coughed several times. Seems insignificant, but she wasn't coughing in yesterday's videos. \n\n\nAlso, the ship is now doing temperature checks with instructions to report temps over 37.5 c. David took his underarm temp and got 36.6 c. I know I'm American and only understand weird Freedom units (farenheit), but don't you add a degree to an underarm temp to make it accurate? That's about .5 c, I think. So his temp is actually about 37.1-37.6. And his wife is coughing. This is day 3 of their quarantine I think. Has anyone else seen his videos? Do you see what I see, or am I just looking for problems?\n\nDavid mentioned that the Brit in this recent batch is a friend of his from this cruise. The man and his wife are on their honeymoon, and both couples are at the same dinner table every night. The man is positive and going to be taken off the ship. The wife isn't positive and will stay onboard. \n\n\nOn a morbid note, if we really are watching them become symptomatic, it'll tell us a lot about what we're looking for. They seem like such fun, kind-hearted people. I don't want them to become sick.

Providing an immediate relief to the population will allow people to stay home and quarantine themselves. \n2. **Provide free treatment for Coronavirus.**  Currently there are people with symptoms that refuse to go to the hospital because its too expensive.  They will not react until they need to be hospitalized, and by that time, they have infected many and our medical systems will be overworked.\n3. **Hygiene education.**  People are stupid.  People in U.S. are laughing at people wearing masks. But also, a lot of people don't know how to properly use a mask and actually increase their chances of getting sick.  They don't know how to not cross contaminate themselves.  \n4. **Close public schools temporarily.**  Kids are gross.   They will end up bringing the virus home to many families if nothing is done.  \n5. **Prioritize supply of food to affected/quarantined areas.**  Military and volunteers should be called to keep the supply lines open and the grid up.  \n6. **Quarantine high density populations with spontaneous human to human transmission.**  If a native citizen shows up to the hospital with coronavirus, it means it has scattered everywhere in the city and small measures are useless.  Promise support, aid, and a constant food supply to keep people from panicking.  \n7. **Implement quarantines immediately.** Just do it, don't let 5m people escape from the city, like Wuhan for example, and make the situation much worst.  Keep other cities safe, and let other cities be able to function and provide support to those in need.  Promise support, promise food, but \"put the mask on yourself before you help others\"\n8. **Be more open and honest.** The Wuhan approach of keeping things quiet will not work with an armed population.

This because it never occurred to hospital administrators that a very sick patient with an infectious disease might show up. There are factories literally down the street that make these suits and masks for international buyers, and nobody thought to buy any for their local hospital. Imagine a chemical company that makes matches, explosives, and fireworks, and it blows up, and it\u2019s learned that there were no fire extinguishers or hoses in the building. Sick people go to hospitals. Some of those people are very sick and can infect doctors. So why weren\u2019t they ready? What kind of education do you need to be able to run a hospital, and how the hell does it happen that you don\u2019t plan on what might happen if a person with an infectious disease comes in the door? How did they get that job? Imagine being a doctor or a nurse, and your boss tells you that there is no protective gear for you, get back and do your job.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t put all your eggs in one basket.\u201d That\u2019s not something you learn in business school; you learn it as a kid.  This saying exists in every language in the world, it\u2019s such common wisdom. So why am I reading news reports that 80% of all American antiviral drugs are made in China? (Source: [https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-care/u-s-officials-worried-about-chinese-control-american-drug-supply-n1052376](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-care/u-s-officials-worried-about-chinese-control-american-drug-supply-n1052376)) We don\u2019t make penicillin anymore. Why isn\u2019t that a national security issue? Why weren\u2019t there hearings in Congress when the number went past\u2014I dunno\u2014half?  Get a guy who makes picnic tables or installs AC for a living and he\u2019s going to say, \u201cWow. What happens if there\u2019s a war?\u201d or, \u201cWhat happens if there\u2019s a big disease and the factories there decide to keep the drugs in their home countries? Does that mean we don\u2019t get any?\u201d How stupid do they have to be, to have allowed that to happen?  What are our governments doing, that nobody gives a damn, until a cataclysm shows up at our doorstep?\n\nHow did we get here? Why is it that all the stock, bond, currency and commodities markets in the world are waiting with bated breath to see whether or not China\u2019s factories will reopen this week? Is that healthy? Does that sound like a healthy and strong and well-diversified economy, if the whole thing falls apart if Foxconn doesn\u2019t get its facilities cleaned up in time to start making iPads again? Kia and Hyundai have shut factories in South Korea, because they can\u2019t get parts from their factories in Hubei. How long will that last? I\u2019ve been to Xiangyang (Hubei) to see the car factories there. It was amazing. What never occurred to me was that some carmakers had 100% of their Tier-1 car part manufacturing there. Had I learned that I would have been immediately worried. Why wasn\u2019t the CEO of Hyundai worried? They ran out of parts in only a few days, and thousands of South Koreans lost their jobs, and won\u2019t get them back until factories in Hubei (Hubei!) come back on line. Anyone want to make bets on when that might be?\n\nWe had a great opportunity back in 2006-2009, when the geniuses running Wall Street banks and the regulators that were supposed to be paying attention blew up the financial system of the world. Nobody went to jail. None of the regulators lost their jobs. Nothing happened. The fact that Goldman Sachs executives got paid to screw over their customers, then got bailed out by the US taxpayers when they convinced Congress that they were too big to fail, suggests that history will repeat here. Tim Cook\u2014Apple CEO\u2014will still be regarded as a genius even though Apple is completely dependent on slave labor in another country risking their lives to get to work this week. McKinsey consultants who have two years of work experience and MBAs from top schools will be paid handsomely to convince CEO\u2019s to concentrate their supply chains in places where McKinsey consultants on the other side of the world can be paid also. And these same CEO\u2019s who are careful to diversity product lines, customer segmentation, marketing strategies, and the investments in their pension plans won\u2019t think twice about putting all their product supply in a country they\u2019ve never seen, let alone in a place where they understand the language, the culture, the political landscape.

If we haven\u2019t already, my theory is that we can with confidence predict that we will soon see a dramatic stabilization in the numbers in the coming days, now through the end of February 2020.\n\nThe \"official\" numbers of infected and suspected cases will stop going up at an alarming rate.  They will stabilize, and then they will begin to fall.  The numbers of purported \u201crecovered\u201d patients will also increase exponentially. You\u2019ll begin to see headlines proclaiming supposedly \u201cgood news\u201d coming out of China about how the virus is no longer spreading, and how it appears to have been successfully contained, and things are going back to business as usual.  That will all be the result of an intentional, organized deception.\n\n1. **Word Play.** Without waiting for the WHO to assign a name, China renamed the virus \u201cNovel Coronavirus Pneumonia.\u201d This signals its intent to only treat a case as confirmed once *pneumonia* has been confirmed. For those patients unable to get inside the overwhelmed hospitals, and for those who die before getting both a coronavirus diagnosis *and* a pneumonia diagnosis, they will not be counted among the confirmed cases. \n\n2. **Quarantine Shelters.** As has been revealed on the leaked videos showing what it's like inside the arenas and buildings that have been converted to quarantine patients (such as the Fang Cang building), there is no medical treatment being provided. These patients are there until they either get better or die, but none of them are being tested or being added to the list of confirmed cases.\n\n3. **Asymptomatic Cases To Be Ignored.** It was revealed yesterday that their new criteria for a diagnosis requires there to be symptoms present. If you test positive for the virus, yet don\u2019t have the required set of symptoms, you will not be added to the list of patients confirmed to have the virus.  This disregards the established fact that people who are asymptomatic may develop symptoms later, including pneumonia, and may be spreading the virus.\n\n4. **Funny Math.** Numbers will be moved around for invalid reasons, solely for the purposes of managing the public perception of the crisis.  For instance, patients will be removed from the confirmed list if they haven\u2019t yet had a positive pneumonia diagnosis.  Patients will be removed from the suspected list if they haven\u2019t yet had a positive pneumonia diagnosis and a positive coronavirus diagnosis.  Thus, the total numbers of confirmed and suspected will stabilize and even decline, without an equal number of numbers being added to the \u201crecovered\u201d or \u201cdied\u201d lists.\n\n5. **Economic Impact.** China desperately needs its factories to reopen.  The week of Feb 3, while the virus was increasing exponentially and spreading around the world, China announced its intent to reopen factories on Feb 10. This signals its intent to protect its economy regardless of the resulting dangers to human life within China and all around the world.

The couple from Forest Grove, Ore., had watched twice previously that week from the balcony of their room on the Diamond Princess as ambulances spirited away people who had tested positive for the virus.\n\nWhat they didn\u2019t realize: This time the Japanese health authorities were coming for Rebecca.\n\n\u201cI was just flabbergasted. You\u2019re dumbfounded to be hearing it is you,\u201d said Mrs. Frasure, 35 years old, in a video interview from her hospital bed in Tokyo this weekend.\n\nThe good news is Mrs. Frasure hasn\u2019t had any of the symptoms of the virus, such as fever or coughing. Her temperature was measured at 97.9 degrees Fahrenheit on Sunday, and she said doctors were doing tests but not specifically treating any ailment.\n\nSoon after, Japanese health officials appeared at the door of the Frasures\u2019s 500-square-foot cabin and signaled with gestures that they were going to insert a thermometer in their ears. The couple filled out a questionnaire and said they didn\u2019t have symptoms of the novel coronavirus.\n\nSomething about the visit prompted the officials to come back the next day. Mrs. Frasure wonders if it was because they checked boxes saying they had taken painkillers\u2014although that was for regular aches and pains, not a fever. The couple were brought to a room on board the ship where a Japanese doctor and nurse inserted a swab stick in their throats to collect samples.\n\nThen came the knock on Friday during breakfast. This time a crew member was translating for Japanese officials, explaining that Mrs. Frasure had to go but Mr. Frasure, 42, couldn\u2019t join his wife because he tested negative.\n\n\u201cIt was pretty surreal to be there at the door and having them tell me, \u2018You tested positive. He has to stay on the ship,\u2019\u201d Mrs. Frasure said. She was given an hour to pack her bags, then waited nearly six hours before officials arrived to take her away.

It\u2019s filled with beanbag stuff,\u201d she said, describing a type of pillow preferred by many people in Japan. Meals consist of dishes like tofu and rice.\n\nMrs. Frasure was told at the hospital that both Japanese and U.S. quarantine laws require her to spend at least another 14 days in isolation. \u201cMy concern is not knowing when I will be out of here,\u201d she said. She also said she wondered whether there would be any hurdles going back to her job in customer service at an insurance company.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr. Frasure, who works for a semiconductor company, is sitting through his own quarantine.

Most factories normally scheduled to open on 2/3 will now not be opening until next week at the earliest.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Factories must apply to the government to reopen, and those factories who produce products that are essentially to daily living (food, medical supplies, etc.) are being given priority** for when they can reopen. We realize that many of you would feel strongly otherwise, but toy and game factories are not considered to be producing products essential to daily living.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;It is expected that the flow of workers back to factories from outlying provinces (and even workers who reside in the cities where their factories of employment are located) will be returning at a very slow rate. This is due to several issues:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Mass transit (rail and bus service) in many cities is effectively shut down. Many highways are closed as well.** There is an extremely high nervousness about the virus throughout China and other areas. Consequently, there is a huge fear that workers are subject to infection if they venture out in public. So, there currently is very little movement of people Manufacturing capacity is therefore expected to ramp up at a very slow rate over the first few weeks after each factory is allowed to open. This translates to a difficulty currently with any factory\u2019s ability to commit to project complete dates. That being said, we do expect that over the next couple months we\u2019ll see manufacturing lead times extended by up to 30 days over normal production timelines.\n\n [https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/f283yb/restoration\\_games\\_is\\_reporting\\_that\\_no\\_game/](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/f283yb/restoration_games_is_reporting_that_no_game/)", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/f2mf6o/chinese_companies_must_apply_to_reopen_factories/", "created_utc": 1581486155}, {"id": "f2muj8", "title": "World War Z to Ebola to CV- N Korea might be the last ones left.

Yeah that sucks, especially in places like the US currently, where the media and 95% of everyone is telling us it's fine, it's not here, go out, live your life.  I feel they are so very incorrect as do many here.  We know its here there and everywhere right now.  It's a real possibility that some of us on this sub are now sick.  \n\nWe are seeing major companies cancel travel, conferences, sales shows, etc.  They know a lot, esp companies like Amazon and Facebook.

Is simply one of these modeling algorithms that the user can control the variables. \n\nThe biggest impact each and everyone of us can have on all of humanity right now is -  dont get sick and if you do, dont get others sick!\n\nIt's a very simple roll.  This virus makes that roll harder because its 2 weeks ahead of us, we dont know we are sick for 2 weeks.  So we have to take a proactive approach.  We have to all pretend we are indeed sick. With the virus, and stay home.  Not 100% quarantine, but a massive reduction in public spaces.\n\nThis is serious folks.  Like to the point of, fuck your job (if it is non essential, we need the medics, drs, research scientists,  gov officials, to help right now, but our being out of there way will make their task much easier.) fuck your birthday party, fuck your wedding, fuck your vacation, fuck flying to go see your mom before she dies ( I'm so sorry, its disturbing that I am saying this, but I hope you understand  the severity of the situation here )  fuck all of our selfish wants and needs right now.

At least it would slow it to a point that it could give researchers more time to try and find a permanent solution. \n\n75,000 members, if each of us were to reduce our public interactions we could save (not infect) 375,000 people.

While this is great news, it does make me wonder..  \n\n\n I believe the Chinese government may decide to seek out recovered patients and either persuade them via propaganda-style means or outright force them to donate blood in order to 'cure' further patients, which would, in turn, lead to further sources for blood donations.   \n\n\nGiven China's precious reputation/image is currently stained by thousands of dying people, I'd say the option is definitely on the table for a government who has already taken various drastic measures. I'd love to hear your opinion on this. If anyone is familiar with the specifics of blood plasma transfusions, perhaps you can provide some additional insight.   \n\n\n# Second infection + cytokine storm\n\nAnother thought I had concerns the emerging information claiming that the virus may be deadlier if caught again after recovery. The idea, as I understand it, is that the immune system has 'learned' to some insufficient/incorrect extent, and upon a second infection, a severe immune response known as a cytokine storm will occur, damaging the body's own cells and causing serious complications.   \n\n\nLet's say an immunocompromised person is infected and manages to make a full recovery (perhaps with the aid of antivirals etc). That person's immune system, by definition, is suppressed to some extent and is less capable of a formidable immune response. If there is anyone who is knowledgeable about this topic, what do you believe would happen if this individual was infected a second time? Would the cytokine storm occur, but with less severity? Would it not occur at all, and the infection would be closer in severity to the first? I find this very interesting since, on one hand, the compromised immune system would lower the chance of survival. However, upon the second infection, would it somewhat serve to actually lessen the severity of the additional damage a healthy immune system would cause?   \n\n\n Link to the video:  \n [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWJHXTnodS0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWJHXTnodS0)", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/f4m42j/secondinfection_cytokine_storm_in/", "created_utc": 1581830414}, {"id": "f4m6c3", "title": "\"The horse is out of the barn\" - Homeland Security Roundtable", "selftext": "I just got a chance to watch this.

These characterizations will not be easily shed. Wuhan, as the capital of Hubei province, has positioned itself as a foreign investment hub and has developed trade, manufacturing and export and development zones to highlight its growth and position within China. Companies will have to assess whether or not their investments should remain in Wuhan or be moved.\n\nConsidering China\u2019s impact on the world economy, China will not be off limits to future investment forever.

I'm not saying this to scare people further, but just to make them aware that striking a healthy balance of staying informed (without obsessing), and taking care of your mental health (whether that be therapy online or in person, taking prescribed medications, meditation, getting rest, general self-care) is just as important as keeping your physical health in check. \n\nJust a gentle reminder to take care of yourself, mentally, emotionally, and physically.

I've been following this issue for about three weeks now\u00a0\u2013 and saw my reaction to it shift back and forth on the worry-o-meter quite a bit. I also think I saw some more or less typical ways of how people react to Corona related news. I'll try to describe those and also give my own assessment as to their ...appropriateness. I'm aware this is my opinion. But hey, if you are looking for strangers on the internet telling you how much freakout this situation warrants ... why not take me. So here it is...4 levels of reaction to Corona news ... what is yours?\n\n**Level 1**: This is another scary thing in the news that's going to blow over never to be heard again. It seems to be flu like in severity and the rest is internet hype and fear-driven hype. And of course, the conspiracy theorists go wild with it ... yawn...nothing to see here. Move along.\n\n**Assessment**: If this is what you think (I did in the beginning), I think your probably underestimating what is going on. I hope I'm wrong (and I think that is possible), but I think there are very real risks both for health consequences and high numbers of death world wide as well as severe economic repercussions.\n\n**Level 2**: This is really worrisome. What we seem to know for sure is that a) it seems very much possible that this is going to be a pandemic b) it is really hard to get a clear picture. A lot is still based on numbers from China and we have good reason to be extremely sceptic abut those. At the same time, there is A LOT OF stuff on the internet that is super worrisome\u00a0\u2013 most of it is probably bullshit, but it looks scary as f'ck and it is hard to assess stuff at the speed it comes out. You are carefully optimistic, but see reasons to worry.\n\n**Assessment**: This is basically me at the moment.\n\n**Level 3:** You spend a lot of time thinking about it and you are scared. You open reddit and facebook a lot\u00a0\u2013 specifically to see the latest news about Corona. It starts to bug you that people around you don't agree about how worrisome this is. You ask yourself, if you overreact. You ask yourself, if you should react more strongly. You are aware you cannot trust everything you read online, but there is so much of it. Each day comes with a new number, a new video a new set of facts\u00a0\u2013 all of them flowing into each other. Some of them must be true, or not? This time\u00a0\u2026 the end might really be nigh. You read somewhere that the virus can stay dormant in mucus cells and that the incubation time might therefore be around 80 days \u00a0\u2013 and even though I'm telling you right now that I've just made this up, 80 days feels somewhat real to you now. What if?\n\n**Assessment**: Fear can induce a liminal state where each new scary fact confirms the fear you felt before. Stop feeding your fear. Quit Facebook, Reddit and Twitter for 2-3 days; at least for Corona news. That doesn't mean you shouldn't think about it, but give your rational brain a chance to catch up. Realize that it is relatively easy to find a scary looking video showing asian looking people in hazmat suits doing things that might not be what, where or when the person posting it claims. Yes, there is reason to worry (I think), but yeah... the internet is a place full of weird people...some of them will scare you for fun. Others believe what they post, but are deep in ...\n\n**Level 4**: By now it is pretty obvious that Corona is a weapon designed for a purpose. Maybe it was released by accident, but an agenda and a coldly executed plan seems a lot more likely. You strongly suspect population control as a motive\u00a0\u2013 it just fits the picture. Satellites measured the chemicals of tens of thousands of burning bodies in the air in the Wuhan region, how is that not media main stream? The fact that it is not basically proves that the media is under complete control by now. If they could clamp down on the media that quickly, no way this wasn't pre-planned!\n\n**Assessment**: Well, this is probably not your first rodeo, meaning not the first time you see the larger truth that others chose to ignore\u00a0\u2013 I don't think there is much I can say that will convince you of my more conservative assessment of what is going on. The only thing I can say, and I really do not mean this as an insult, is this: I believe you are wrong about this and really far off the deep end. Maybe mark 6 months from now in your calendar (August 29th). If the world hasn't ended then, if Covid-19 really finds its place among other flu-like viruses, going around, killing the older and the weaker, then vanishing again for a while\u00a0\u2013 look back at what you were thinking now and use that as an opportunity to reflect on how you form your opinions. I'll do the same; 6 months should give me a lot of hindsight to test my opinions of today against.\n\n**Level X**: You are a troll and this is a gold mine. It is f'ing funny how much people freak out, when you feed them the right bullshit\u00a0\u2013 and man...you're good at it. It's hillarious. Like ... maaaaaaaan..you're good!\n\n**Assessment**: Fuck you.", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/f6jv15/4_levels_of_reaction_to_corona_news_level_x/", "created_utc": 1582156315}, {"id": "f6k3gc", "title": "Situation is much worse in iran than they say", "selftext": "This is not a conspiracy theory, those of you who know iran\u2019s governments you know that they hide and cover up many stuff including shooting down ukrainian airplane...\nI swear to you people there are hundreds of people who are infected in iran not only in qom but in other cities as well, they didn\u2019t inform people because they wanted people to come out and celebrate the 41st anniversary of Islamic Revolution and now that its done, they are letting loose the information.\nMany med students around iran are sending videos and pictures in telegram app to channels that there are many other people who died and are infected, It is a human disaster in iran\nGov is so scared that they are now trying to quarantine the whole City Of Qom.\nYou will here a lot more about iran and corona i promise you that its just a matter of time!!", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/f6k3gc/situation_is_much_worse_in_iran_than_they_say/", "created_utc": 1582157302}, {"id": "f6kc2l", "title": "Mods deleted this because \u201cit was already posted\u201d but it has never been posted in here before...

All purchases must be made online or in groups and delivered to their communities. \n\nThis raises an interesting question about food supply and the logistics of supplying groceries to a city of 9 million people each day that I think has not really been discussed in this sub. \n\nSome of the issues that have been raised:\n\n- Before the new quarantine laws were put in place, citizens in Wuhan were still allowed to go to the supermarket to buy groceries. At that time, even though there was some panic buying, generally speaking the stores were well stocked and prices are generally kept the same. \n\n- Now, people have to place bulk orders or buy with their \u5c0f\u533a (which is essentially a collection of apartment buildings, you can think of it as buying groceries with your street). The food will then be delivered to the street. This is part of an increased quarantine measure to limit local transmission\n\n- As a result of the increased transportation cost. Food prices, especially meat has gone up. Based on reports in Weibo, beef \ud83e\udd69 prices has increased from 30 RMB ($~4 USD) per Lb to 70-80 RMB (~$10-12 USD) per Lb. Furthermore, people are required to make orders in bulk packages \ud83d\udce6 to facilitate logistics. \n\n- So instead of delivering one apple \ud83c\udf4e and 3 onions \ud83e\uddc5 to Joe, which would be a huge waste of resources and a logistical nightmare when multiplied to 9 million people, people have a selection of package to choose from, such as fruit bundles (which might include 5lbs of apples, 3 lbs of bananas, 2lbs of strawberries etc), grain bundles, vegetable bundles. This also makes pickup easier as instead of picking up individualized packages, people can just pick up pre-packaged bundles that are much easier to distribute and keep track of. \n\n- By this point people in Wuhan have been under lockdown for over a month. Although most people are doing okay, economic pressure is starting to build up. Essentially many people have been living without income for over a month now and money is running low. The expected return to work day is March 10th in Wuhan but people are not optimistic given that cases are still going up by 3 digits each day. \n\n- the upside is that other provinces have been donating a lot of produce to Wuhan and there are many images of free groceries that have been delivered to different districts in Wuhan \n\nI know that the struggles of people living in Wuhan might seem abstract to many people on this sub. But these are real people and these are very real problems. \n\nFurthermore, I think it\u2019s interesting to see how these strict quarantine measures can be implemented and made feasible, such as dealing with the issue of supplying people with food and toiletries \ud83e\uddf4 when they are unable to leave their house. Very sad to say but with the way things are going, similar practices may be put into place in other countries in the future.", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/f861xo/issues_with_food_supply_to_wuhan/", "created_utc": 1582440944}, {"id": "f8673k", "title": "Employees, who worked in cruise ship, went back to work without test.

While /r/COVID19 holds the majority of science based discussions and research, the users over at /r/CovidMapping have been looking for more help to discover the growth of the virus and its emergence around the globe.

What this means is that SARS-CoV-2 spreads signficantly faster than the seasonal flu. \n\n2. The Case Fatality Rate (CFR) of SARS-CoV-2 is at least 2-3%^[[3](https://academic.oup.com/ajcp/advance-article/doi/10.1093/ajcp/aqaa029/5735509)] .

SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted without the infected showing any symtoms^[[5](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2762028)] . This makes it much more difficult to control. \n\n4. Roughly 20% of SARS-CoV-2 infections result in serious symptoms that require medical intervention^[[6](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/coronavirus-81-of-cases-are-mild-study-says#80.9%-of-the-cases-are-mild)] . This is more than 10 times the hospitalization rate of the seasonal flu^[[7](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/index.html)].\n\n5. Symptoms from SARS-CoV-2 can persist over a month^[[8](https://www.thelancet.com/pb-assets/Lancet/pdfs/S2213260020300795.pdf)] compared to the seasonal flu where symptoms typically tend to clear after 5 days^[[9](https://www.emedicinehealth.com/flu_in_adults/article_em.htm)] .\n\n6. There is no vaccine for SARS-CoV-2^[[10](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/prevention-treatment.html)] whereas people regularly get annual flu shots. \n\n7. There is no [herd immunity](https://www.ovg.ox.ac.uk/news/herd-immunity-how-does-it-work) for SARS-CoV-2 which means that it can theoretically infect the entire population. *See*, for example, a [Korean psychiatric department where the virus infected 99/102 people](https://twitter.com/covid_19news/status/1231581727438467072?s=21). \n\n\nNow, consider the multiplicative effect that all of these attributes have for the virus. Compared to the seasonal flu, SARS-CoV-2 (1) spreads faster; (2) kills far more; (3) is harder to control; (4) requires use of far more medical resources; (5) for far longer a period of time; (6) has no effective treatment; and (7) can infect entire populations. \n\nThese factors mean that SARS-CoV-2, if left unchecked, is far more likely to overwhelm a country's medical infrastructure. Additionally, when medical infrastructure is overwhelmed, the CFR will skyrocket because we know that 20% of cases require medical intervention. \n\nIt doesn't take a genius to piece it all together.

Here's a summary of the trends today.\n\n**Confirmed Cases:**\n\nOnly an increase of 785, maintaining growth of only 1-2% per day. This should be good news, but given China's reputation it's as if they've stopped trying to test.\n\n**Deaths:**\n\nAs stated in the headline, the number of deaths today is at 2619. An increase of 158.\n\nOne side effect the decreased number of confirmed cases is actually causing, is in increasing the controversial WHO death rate to **over 3%** (often *still* reported in the media at 1-2%). It will continue to increase if confirmed cases continues to grow slower than number of deaths. This is the reason why I've consistently chosen to calculate the *actual death rate* on the number of recovered, today holding steady at **9.5%**.\n\nAlso, I've added in a new rate that takes into account the 2 week incubation period, comparing the number of deaths today to the number of confirmed cases 14 days ago. Today that rate is at **6.1%**.\n\n**Other Notes:**\n\nThe Suspected numbers are so meaningless now, I might as well stop tracking it.\n\n**DISCLAIMER**\n\n*It is my personal opinion that I sincerely doubt that these official reported numbers are anywhere near accurate at the moment. Therefore I'd recommend taking these numbers with a grain of salt and a hint of skepticism (without being panicked).

Am I wrong?", "selftext": "First and foremost I've got to say that I have no credentials in this field. I've never claimed to be an expert and I never will. I have some basic knowledge regarding mostly older outbreaks because I've studied them in my field. This post will mostly talk about my thoughts and why people need to \"relax\". I hate that word but it's quite fitting.\n\nIf you're still reading this I would like to say hello and that my english might be subpar but I'll try my best. Some of you might look through my history or even know me by name because I've been on here quite a bit since the outbreak \"began\". I'm mostly known as a \"anti-doomer\" if one could use that term. I've been called most things since I dont buy into the scenario about Corona being \"disease-x\" even though some experts say it might. I would also like to point out that I've been prepping since early days with masks, hand-gel, gloves, goggles and you name it. I've shown you two sides of the same coin and it's ok if you disagree with either side. I've never downplayed this virus but I'm not sure it's \"disease-x\" either.\n\nLast few days the sheer amount of misinformation and fearmongering have actually been insane. I dont know if people are bored, trying to stir something up or actually believe what they're writing but it has to stop. The last week or so I've given multiple people the chance to explain their thoughts behind a bold claim regarding for example how many people will get infected. People always give me the link to Marc Lipsitch and it's always with a smug answer like *Bruh, how do you not know about Marc?*. I've gotta say it's great that more people are aware of Marc Lipsitch but please **dont** stop reading when you've seen what you *want* to see. It's like some people need their daily fix for this virus and it's actually quite disturbing. This sub and others alike have become huge echo-chambers for bad news, good news may only be fake btw. If you actually had a interest in Marc Lipsitch you would've known that he talks about many different scenarios. Same with Marion Koopmans or other experts thats frequently talked about on this sub.\n\nI would say that the next problem is on par or maybe even worse then **choosing to be misinformed**, fearmongering. Many of you do not realize what a harsh and extremely bad climate you're creating by only pushing and/or accepting your narrative for how this outbreak will \"play out\". News from China is a good exemple for describing what I'm talking about. Bad news is always true and good news is always fake. Even though both news are from China and maybe even the same source people choose to believe what's pushing their \"agenda\". If you want to know what I'm talking about it's just to watch every bad number-update from China contra every positive number-update from China . My take on this? I choose to believe that this outbreak is really bad and something we all should be aware of but that good news might actually happen. If I dislike a source I would not start trusting them just because they start posting news about things I agree on. It's still the same shit source as when I didnt agree.\n\n**This sub need to become nuanced, yesterday if that could work. At this moment I would say that some, I could even say most of you are not better than what youre currently hating. Aint that a sad realization when you discover that youre doing the exact same thing China is doing according to you? You're literlly creating this echo-chamber by yourself. Only enabling discussion with people that share your mindset is wrong and not good for the climate we're in.**\n\nI've made my point and I'm not going to sit here and say what's right or wrong about different opinions regarding Corona. It's ok if you think this is the big one but please be informed while trying to explain why because we need a better climate on this sub. Maybe we're only seeing the tip of the iceberg, maybe we've already peaked, maybe it's true that warmer climate is good. We,**on this sub**, have no idea what's right or wrong. Stop feeling like you're **woke** and it's your duty to inform everyone (with mostly false information) about the horrors that's awaiting. I've never seen a good, well-thought post about why this should be \"disease-x\". The one's whom been trying is mostly wrong or just straight up false.

Either because of some perverse 'small government' ideology getting in the way or they themselves are compromised ethically and on principle. Thinking more about stock markets and stock holders, billionaires and economics; rather than doing their own actual jobs. \n\nThey are not economists, they are not the banks. At the end of the day, and the fact of the matter is, it's not their job. Their job is public service and safeguarding the public and serving the interests and general welfare of the people. \n\nProtecting and safeguarding LIVES. \n\nThat should be their only concern in this matter. Yet by the conduct of some, the sheer moral bankruptcy of others, one would think the job of government was to be globalist only for Wallstreet and the world economy but useless for absolutely everything else that actually matters more.  \n\nHuman life and the preservation of it is paramount, primary, crucial and fundamental. It circumvents all other concerns in an event such as this. \n\nIt is self-evident. \n\nYet to not even be there to address people's fears, for as long as need be, to address their anxieties but instead allow them to stew in uncertainty, is quite frankly devoid of any sanity and humanity. How can you claim to be trying to avoid panic, when your own actions incite panic? How can any politician claim to be handling this, yet contradict their own statement by clearly doing nothing?\n\nWhere have all the adult gone?\n\nThe bankers and economists are not immoral. If your only concern are them and their stock holders; this virus doesn't care if you do. So what is the use of all this gross postulating by our politicians? If it's because it's just poor people bearing the brunt then perhaps Western civilization is done. \n\nThis cannot continue.  Even if this outbreak isn't as severe as Swine Flu, the conduct of our politicians is contemptible and condemnable. Which begs the question: If there ever was a major event like Swine Flu or Spanish flu, do we really want those that are in power today, to still be in power? \n\nI would hope not. Things need to change. \n\nDo not think for one moment you are helpless, or that this is it. Its far from it. Don't let all these cases instil in you fear that weakens you. Heath is not only physical but also psychological, and it impacts your body. Please remain optimistic, as absurd as it seems. It's bad, but there is expectation and there is determination.

Wish there was more detailed description out there than just symptoms, which you have no idea at what stage you'll get and how severe they have to be in order to seek medical treatment.

Those products also lower immunity. Eating a diet based on organic* vegetables and lean meat gives you a leg up. I also do intermittent fasting (sometimes for 24 hours) and eat raw garlic pretty often. \n\nOn top of that I take probiotics and astragalus everyday and drink tons of water and ginger tea. \n\nGetting Vitamin D (from the sun) is also hugely important. \n\nThat\u2019s my regular routine...that\u2019s how it was long before this virus came along. \n\nIf you want to take on a virus with cheese, wine and cookies in your system go ahead, but I\u2019m not sure it\u2019ll bode well for you", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fa3gz6/we_have_to_calm_down_and_be_proactive/", "created_utc": 1582763710}, {"id": "fa3lty", "title": "Realistically, (in Europe) are supermarkets actually gonna run out of stuff or something?

If you can get your hands on freeze dried food with a 20 year shelf life that's great. Homeland security is buying up supplies along with others, so there is delays in that. Go to your groccery store, and stock up on canned goods with a year or more shelf life. Be sure to set that aside, along with your other food your normally buy. Write the expiration date on the top, and rotate it into your daily diet assuming you can replenish. You need to do this in the next few days before the public panics like they do before a hurricane, and empty the store shelves. If you have children, make sure you have a few months worth of diapers, and baby food. You can go hungry, but your child can't.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have all lived our lives in prosperity, excess, and abundance and never really experienced scarcity.

You will not regret it. Even if you think this is paranoid and an exaggeration, there will be two sides to this in the end that will say I told you so.

Nearly 3,000 deaths. More than 81,000 cases. Six continents infected.\n\nBut government officials and medical experts, in their warnings about the epidemic, have also sounded a note of reassurance: Though the virus can be deadly, the vast majority of those infected so far have only mild symptoms and make full recoveries.\n\nIt is an important factor to understand, medical experts said, both to avoid an unnecessary global panic and to get a clear picture of the likelihood of transmission.\n\n\u201cMany people are now panicking, and some actually are exaggerating the risks,\u201d said Dr. Jin Dongyan, a virology expert at the University of Hong Kong. \u201cFor governments, for public health professionals \u2014 they also have to deal with these, because these will also be harmful.\u201d\nMuch about the virus remains unknown, and the danger could intensify as it travels through the rest of the world. But based on existing information, here\u2019s what experts say about the severity of the virus.\n\nMore than 80 percent of cases are mild, one large study in China found.\nOf the 44,672 coronavirus cases that were confirmed in China by Feb. 11, more than 36,000 \u2014 or 81 percent \u2014 were mild, according to a study published recently by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nCases were considered mild if they did not involve pneumonia, defined as infection of the lungs, or involved only mild pneumonia, the authors wrote in the study, which is among the largest to date of the new coronavirus\n\nThere were two other categories of cases, severe and critical. Severe cases featured shortness of breath, low blood oxygen saturation or other lung problems. Critical cases featured respiratory failure, septic shock or multiple organ dysfunction.\n\nJust under 14 percent of patients were severe, and just under 5 percent critical.\n\nThe overall fatality rate in China was 2.3 percent. But that number was inflated by the much higher fatality rate in Hubei Province, of 2.9 percent, compared with a rate of just 0.4 percent in the rest of the country. The seasonal flu, by comparison, has a mortality rate of about 0.1 percent\n\nFrom : https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/27/world/asia/coronavirus-treament-recovery.html\n\nTheres more but it's too laborious to copy and paste on a phone with all the pictures and ads.

If it has a doubling time of a week, it would take ten weeks from now to reach 1% of the worlds population. An extra six to have infected a majority of people, taking us to the end of June. Since it was discovered in December, this would be similar to 1918 Flu of around six months to peak. By which point we will - hopefully - have a vaccine.\n\nOn the one hand, this timeframe can be extended by quarantines and lockdowns to slow the spread. On the other hand, that would also wreck havoc with supply chains... on the third hand, if we have a few months to prepare we can be in a far better place for dealing with it when it peaks.\n\nIs this a reasonable scenario?", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fabwiu/potential_timeframe_of_a_pandemic/", "created_utc": 1582809236}, {"id": "fac2at", "title": "The reason for children and young adults to cope with SARS-CoV-19 better than older people?", "selftext": "Hey guys, someone posted on how children and their parents, who experienced infection/ a \"cold\" with human coronavirus OC43 lately, might experience mostly mild symptoms and that this could be a theory to investigate.

I have some tips for what procedures can help minimize risk of transmission and just to improve general cleanliness. Bear in mind some of this is simply not realistic in a home, but it may help give ideas.\n\nFor airborne rooms we have an additional precaution of allowing the room to be empty for 1-2 hours after discharge to allow air suspended viral particles time to reach the floor. \n\nFor any influenza/respiratory illness we use (at minimum) a disposable gown, gloves and surgical mask. Eye protection added if it is airborne or the patient is still present due to risk of droplets from coughing/sneezing. \n\nIf you have a loved one coming home or want to prepare a room for possible  isolation, there are a few things to keep in mind.\n\n1) Get the ppe set up ready. At the hospital we use a moveable cart with gowns/gloves/masks etc. I want to recommend getting proper PPE if possible, particularly the mask and gloves. Any disposable shield that can help keep viral particles off your clothes would still be better than nothing. A garbage or recycle bag worn over the body and taped with duct tape is still better than nothing. If you have water resistant clothes this is the time to use them. \n\n2) Set up a disposal method. Whatever goes into the room is considered single use, and anything that comes out (including PPE) needs to be properly removed and disposed of. We use extra strong garbage bags, with one set up at the door or (ideally) an anteroom that is meant for donning and doffing PPE. \n\n3) minimize the amount of surfaces as much as possible. Think hospital room. No extras, dedicated equipment/ bathroom with almost nothing in it, etc. The more clutter the more surface area for virus particles to settle. \n\n4) Linen is the worst. Strip out curtains, cover carpet if that is an option. Remove rugs. Limit bedding. Fevers can also be made worse with piles of blankets. Any fabrics removed after the person has become isolated should be double bagged while still in PPE, then (while wearing another set of PPE) should be put in the washing machine and washed and dried on high heat with some bleach added in. \n\n5) We use bleach (clorox) or hydrogen peroxide, but in our ER its exclusively bleach. We go from high touch surface to low, and cleanest to dirtiest. So dust and particles will fall downward and still be cleaned up, and you don't clean a toilet and then with the same rag clean a table. Be mindful of what is typically touched and where. \n\n6) Make sure touch surfaces stay wet for the amount of time recommended on the cleaner. A one minute contact time requires the surface to STAY wet for 1 full minute. If it dries too soon it may not be as effective.\n\n7) The doffing of PPE is crucial. I take the garbage bag out of the bin, then remove my gown and put it in the garbage. I remove my gloves, sanitize my hands (so have that in/beside the door), and then remove my respirator using the tips of my pinky fingers to remove the bands and GENTLY remove the mask. Do not let the mask bounce around if it can be helped. Sanitize hands again and then step out of the room. You can wear booties that are disposable (found in paint areas of stores) if you want, or remove the shoes, wipe down with bleach and then sanitize hands again. \n\n*For extra precautions you can also block vents (I would strongly recommend this just to avoid a lot of particle spread. Keep window in room open when weather allows for it, but ensure it isnt just blowing the air into another space/window.*", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/faxfp2/tips_from_a_critical_care_cleaner_for_home/", "created_utc": 1582907958}, {"id": "faxqkh", "title": "We should be demanding that China hand over its coronavirus research with the threat of sanctions.", "selftext": "There are thousands of wet markets in china and only one Bio 4 lab.

There's a fuckton of patient who die from pneumonia. What will kill us is a new influx of patients, patients that will might need weeks of treatment, as compared to the usual pneumonia cases. Antibiotics are a miracle drug, I've seen patient \nalmost at death's door make a comeback and be discharged after a week of IV antibiotics. Anti-virals are nowhere near their effectiveness.

Also talk about how recovery from events like this often is generated by stifled consumer demand jumping back up after forced hiatus, and the markets recovering from a natural flow of investors moving to depressed stocks. \n\nHere is my question in that context. With the govt scheduled to slow repo spending in April.  Stacked with sustained limited manufacturing during quarantine, potential small/med business failure from lack of consumers and components, job loss from failing businesses and depleted individuals funds from a month or two with no pay from many not able to work from home. The corrections after govt stops subsidizing liquidity, and a returning workforce with sequelae requiring cont'd medical care. How can this economic recovery look anything like previous models being used today?\n\nPeople with no jobs and no money can't have pent up demand to buy supply that will take months to replenish and be unavailable at scale until what seems like q3 or q4. The consumer both economically and literally is going to be sick and dying for what [@ScottGottliebMD](https://twitter.com/ScottGottliebMD) [@DrTomFrieden](https://twitter.com/DrTomFrieden) [@T\\_Inglesby](https://twitter.com/T_Inglesby) and others suggest could be seasonal or sustained until a vaccine is developed. I am not trying to be apocalyptic, but more curious where a trajectory of economic recovery might come from.\n\nOne realm consumer confidence comes from seems to be jobs availability, but with \\~90% of Fortune 1000 exposed to the Chinese supply chain disruption, as the virus spreads and losses occur... Closed companies, contracted growth at company and state levels, and a market unsubsidized. It seems like tree strikes for the consumer and a significant blow to the last leg the market had to stand on. Is this time to settle in for a long ride and can you please poke holes is what I hope is an oversimplified view of a complex situation? \n\nIt looks like the backstop against the bottom falling out of the economy is employment numbers/ consumer spending capability/ consumer confidence/ supply chain recovery. All of these variables being in the same pipeline feels like a stack of cards. The following three videos from CNBC segments seem to address this observation. Am I reading this incorrectly?\n\nMarkets haven't reached panic territory based on our model, Citi strategist says [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgCzPbFfki4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgCzPbFfki4) \n\nWhat history of big market losses can tell investors about coronavirus sell-off [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-1ccDZHtE0&amp;t=188s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-1ccDZHtE0&amp;t=188s) \n\nWhy this strategist says investors have to watch US employment [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCL1p3hHq\\_k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCL1p3hHq_k) \n\nMods please let me know if this too is better put to the \"Daily Discussion\" page.

For safety at the moment I have to assume 8 days.", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fb50hf/what_corona_virus_misinformation_have_you_come/", "created_utc": 1582939233}, {"id": "fb5bx0", "title": "If anyone on this sub gets the coronavirus I\u2019ll give them $10", "selftext": "Title says it all.
