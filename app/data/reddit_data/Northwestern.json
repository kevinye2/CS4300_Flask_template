I'm not saying you should let this be a fear that takes over your life, that's not healthy. I just want to explain why it should be taken more seriously. \n\nFurther, \nI'm not giving medical advice, I'm not pre-med, but I (believe) I have a better than average understanding of disease spread. Not stating anything here as definitive. I did, however, spend a very, very long amount of my time researching all perspectives on Coronavirus (I have close relatives with weakened immune systems) and want to offer my opinion.  \n\nThis is also particularly because of the highly upvoted post about proper hygiene so spring Q doesn't get cancelled, like other schools have. \nWhile people should definitely have proper hygiene, that's a preventative but non-comprehensive measure. \n\n**So let's get to it:**\n\nIf it hits it us it will still spread (a conservative estimate is 3^n, 3 people infected for each person infected - the worst case scenario is 70% worldwide contraction (WORST CASE) peaking in a month (a lot of people underestimate exponential growth), and **fast** (people in dorms would be in major risk) and affect even the good hygiene people (you're bound to touch your face at some point, no matter what). People need to stop comparing it to the flu - the flu has treatment, this does not. Italy had 14 cases 2 weeks ago, and has 366 dead (166 just yesterday, including leader of democratic party who said to \"keep going as normal\" and 7500+ cases now, and that's only the confirmed ones. Trump Admin is treating it as the Flu. He tweeted today it's just like the flu. Maybe situation @ CPAC will get them to take it more seriously, but that's wishful thinking. Illinois has had over 20 confirmed cases, and isn't taking any measures differently from Italy. And to those who would argue the money for tuition, I posit that low-income/low-resource students would be MOST affected by an outbreak. The e-mail they sent today shows the university's starting to tell instructors to cut us slack. \n\nWhat I want to make clear is unless there is a sudden peak and reverse in the next two weeks, NU should likely move classes online, as Princeton and Stanford have. This isn't a money issue; it's health and that's a human right. There are students here with underlying conditions that put them particularly at risk. Death rate figures are still extremely variable, and we can't count on reliable facts from CDC so the best measure to take is airing on the side of caution. For people that want to compare it to SARS and MERS, check coronainfo.xyz and look at the insane exponential difference between COVID and these. I don't mean this post to cause hysteria; but I think people are being too relaxed about it, which was (Italy, Iran, China's mistake, yet Korea took it seriously and contained it), and politicians in BOTH parties will seek to minimize panic, not give out facts. \n\nWe don't know if it has permanent effects. We honestly don't know anything. People who \"recovered it\" have re-contracted it two weeks later - does it lay dormant? Do we ever gain immunity? What are the long-lasting effects, and what do they depend on? Tons of wild outcomes keep coming out, some not even reliable. Unless you have the answers to all these questions, you can't encourage people to relax and act like nothing's going on, telling them to just keep washing your hands a lot. \n\nIf the situation continues to exponentially grow (which I and many others expect it to, no signs of stopping - unlike SARS and MERS did in warmth, it's spreading just fine in southern hemisphere in summertime), for NU to give take home finals or do spring Q online is not just the responsible choice, it's the morally correct choice.

This is the megathread for discussing everything RD-related! Separate sufficiently-related posts will be removed.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n*When will I find out about housing/how does housing work?*  \n[Check out this page for an overview of the new student housing process.](https://www.northwestern.edu/living/housing-options/housing-selection/new-students/index.html) The tl;dr goes like this: You'll fill out a housing contract sometime in April, where you will rank your top 5 or so housing options. Then, your housing and roommate assignments will be released sometime in early August. [Explore housing options here!](https://www.northwestern.edu/living/housing-options/undergrad-housing/index.html)\n\n*Should I find a roommate or should I go random?*  \nThe housing contract has a very short questionnaire that is used to match you to a roommate. From my experience, there is not necessarily a higher \"success\" rate among people who picked their roommates compared to those who went random. So unless you care a lot about the type of person you want your roommate to be, I woud say it's not really worth the trouble to find yourself a roommate before you submit your application.\n\n*Can I transfer schools?*  \nGenerally, yes. Transferring schools is pretty easy - just send an email to the registrar asking about it. You may have slightly more difficulty transferring into schools that are more specialized, like Bienen or School of Comm. Other than that, transferring is incredibly easy. I would, however, definitely do it before your first quarter so you can properly plan your schedule.\n\n*How is ___ class? How is ___ professor?*  \nCTECS are a great resource to learn about specific classes/teachers! They're anonymous reviews left by previous students and I've found them to be incredibly useful. You'll be able to access CTECS through Caesar once you have a netID. If possible, please check the CTECS before asking about a class here - if you still have questions after checking, then you can feel free to ask!\n\n*Should I study computer science in McCormick or Weinberg?*  \nIn either school, the CS major will have the same requirements. The difference comes from whether you want to complete the McCormick basic requirements (like DTC and EA) or the Weinberg ones (distros and language). A McCormick degree will be engineering-heavy while a Weinberg one will feel more liberal-arts. Neither is \"better\" for a CS career. It entirely depends on what you want out of your college experience.\n\n*Other questions?*  \nBefore asking a question here, it would be awesome if you could do a quick search of the subreddit, just to see if it's come up before! If that doesn't help then feel free to come back here and ask.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIf questions keep coming up or if people have suggestions, I'll be adding them here!", "title": "RD Admissions Megathread + FAQ"}, {"created_utc": 1584727379, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Northwestern/comments/flzka9/cap_and_gown_orders_for_commencement_hopefully/", "id": "flzka9", "is_self": true, "score": 1, "selftext": "Have orders for caps and gowns been sent out for us (graduating undergrads), or did I somehow miss the deadline?

The lack of rationale/candor for doing so, exhibited in the university\u2019s vague statement that \u201cNorthwestern will continue to provide a high-quality education, whether remotely or in person, so tuition will still be charged at the same rate for Spring Quarter,\u201d is unsatisfactory. It is easy to preach \u201cbrave leadership\u201d, but quite another to practice it by breaking ranks from other leading universities and doing the right thing, especially given the uncertain economic climate that students are graduating into. A collection of Kellogg students took the attached list of arguments pro tuition adjustment to the Kellogg administration and the Northwestern Provost to lobby on behalf of the wider student body \u2013 an executive summary is set forth below:*\n\n*1. Online learning represents a fundamentally new product warranting new, fair pricing*\n\n*2. Students should not bear the brunt of the financial burden themselves (as would be the case if they paid regular tuition for an online service) and Kellogg/Northwestern has access to a multi-billion dollar endowment that can be accessed in times of crisis* \n\n*3. Kellogg/Northwestern will ultimately benefit from good faith pricing as students (i.e. future alumni) will remember the actions of the administration during this time*\n\n*4. Kellogg should align its actions with its ethos of brave leadership and not take a \"follow the leader\" approach to tuition reduction*\n\n*The way this crisis is handled will assuredly impact Northwestern and Kellogg for years to come \u2013 both in terms of matriculation and alumni donations. In this vein, I personally do not identify with the decisions made by Northwestern and Kellogg. I would urge you, fellow Kellogg students/alumni, to directly reach out to the Kellogg Deans, Northwestern Provost, and Northwestern President if you are similarly disheartened by today\u2019s determination, so that they can receive a fulsome (and unignorable) account of how their decision has impacted you.

How would you characterize the overall vibe of Northwestern? Is it more relaxed or competitive?\n\n2. Which kinds of students are happy here? Which ones are not?\n\n3. I know it gets really cold in the winter, but how oppressive actually is it?\n\n4. How are the dorms? Are they divided by area of study?\n\n5. What\u2019s Evanston like?\n\n6. Northwestern seems to have a better social scene than most of the schools on my list. How often are there parties, and do they revolve entirely around the Greek system?\n\nNow for ISP specific questions:\n\n7. Are the teachers for ISP more concerned about research than teaching, or do they make lectures engaging?\n\n8. How much do ISP students interact with students from outside the program?\n\n9. How much easier is it to get research opportunities while in ISP?\n\n10. What\u2019s the ISP house like?\n\n11. Do ISP students have to take the same amount of core classes as the rest of Northwestern?\n\nIt\u2019d help me a ton if you could answer just 1 or 2 of these, since I may not get the chance to see Northwestern in person.

Should this situation arise, I would like to make an *informed* decision whether or not I should enroll. Therefore I have a few questions about the pre-med track at Northwestern.\n\n1. Are grades inflated, deflated, or neither? How hard is it to get good grades (since they\u2019re important for medical school admission)\n\n2. How good is the pre-med advising?\n\n3. How easy is it to form great relationships with your professors for recommendation letters?\n\n4. I don\u2019t know if anyone knows this but what percentage of Northwestern pre-meds actually get into medical school?\n\n5. I initially applied for biomedical engineering but I may switch majors. Is it hard to switch out of the engineering school to another one, say like Weinberg?\n\n6. Is the environment more cutthroat or collaborative? What\u2019s student life like?\n\n7. How difficult is it to get research opportunities?\n\nI\u2019m about to commit to another private school where I received a full-tuition scholarship.
