Is there a way to rent a specific car in Chicago that would not ruin me financially?\n\nThe thing is, I'd love to rent one of a few typical U.S. cars that I totally love - Dodge Challenger, Ford Mustang, Chevrolet Camaro, you know what I mean. Not an SUV. It doesn't have to be a convertible, it doesn't have to be the newest model (but I'm quite positive that the 1970 Camaro/Impala would be much more expensive than the new generation one - I'd love to be proven wrong, though). I just want to have a great memory of driving through the U.S. roads in one of those cars I admired since I was little.\n\nBeing from Europe, I need a full insurance coverage, which I understand is not cheap, but still, I would love to rent such car from Chicago for 10 days or so (probably 2-3k miles) - ideally for less than $1000. The problem is, I don't know the local rental services, and googling it will always offer me the big companies with generic offer like \"Dodge Challenger or similar\". Don't mean to be picky, but I'd be pretty bumped, if I would come in and realize they don't have the selected car available and I will receive a similar one, but one that is quite common in EU like Mercedes, or Toyota, etc. It doesn't seem like I could book a specific model in any of those. The closest one I found is Sixt, which sometimes allows a specific car rent, but in Chicago, it doesn't offer any of my preferred models. It does have an offer \"Ford Mustang Convertible or Chevrolet Camaro convertible, or similar\" which gives me a bit of hope (both of those would be great), and it's not that expensive either, but I'm still not convinced.\n\nDo you have any experience / advice, please? Or some local car rental services which I will never find through google? Is there even a way of renting it in advance, or do I have to come personally, and go through the various car rental services, and see what's in stock?

I've pretty much decided that once I've got all that stuff shipped over I'll pack my clothes and essentials into 2 large duffel bags that I own and move to wherever I end up going. I'd move with her now, but we're both in agreement that the school I currently attend is good for me and that there are better jobs here compared to where my mother lives.

I've been looking for a place to live and it's becoming hard to juggle all the variables, so I was wondering if you guys had any insight for me. Most of the other interns are grabbing university housing, but I am on trimesters so the semester schedule doesn't work for me. \n\nI am trying to balance safety, commute time, cost, and fun in that order of priority. I want to be somewhere I wouldn't worry about walking home at night. I'd like to take the metro and have a reasonable walk to and from the metro. My budget is around $1400 a month for rent, with some flexibility since I'll only be in Chicago for a few months so I want to enjoy it. For that same reason, I'm looking for a trendy/lively neighborhood. \n\nI've looked at some places around Wicker Park that seem to fit the bill. Is it worth the cost? Wrigleyville and that area also are high on my list, but I was wondering if the slightly longer commute is worth it. Finally, I found some places near the medical district in my budget with a good commute. Would it be too boring? I also considered Hyde Park and some neighborhoods around there, but the commute seems to be a bit longer and I heard it could be unsafe. Can anyone weigh in on the south side? \n\nLast year, I had about an hour drive to my internship. I couldn't really hang out with the other interns due to that. Living too far away wasn't very enjoyable, so I am trying to stay as close to the Loop as possible without breaking the bank or compromising on safety. \n\nSorry if I sound a bit ignorant in any way.

She is super sweet and spoils me with great food and she has sweet pets.\n\nI'm very ADHD with a lot of energy... I need a lot of stimulation. There is so much love here, and I am grateful, but this is not a great match. I'm really bored. I'm in a place where I don't know anyone, and there really isn't any way to meet other people here. I feel like I'm in isolation here. Even her street is a dead-end street, you never see anyone outside, no families just small apartments with mostly seniors.\n\nI usually get to spend time during the holidays with my younger cousins (kids, teens, 20s, early 30s) who are always busy and active, take me out with them, and there's constant back-and-forth banter... I love that and miss it bad. The companionship and they're super curious about my life and vice versa.  Video games with each other, hoops, wrestling and goofing around or just talking about life. It's very social and high key when I'm with them, no matter where we go or what we do.\n\nI feel guilty about feeling down this Christmas, and I know it shows. I really just need to find stuff to do so I can be in a better mood when I'm around my aunt. I feel like she could think I'm ungrateful or that she's done someone wrong. She already got frustrated with me and asked if \"I expect the world to entertain me.\" She thinks her quiet corner of the world is just perfect and can't understand why I would not feel the same way.\n\nI've tried going out to bars by myself and that is just no fun, also I'm not a drinker (as in 1 drink is enough.) Bars are fine with friends, but not solo. I've tried other solo excursions and just feel worse. Doing things by myself for the whole holiday season just isn't appealing. I am not great at approaching people and starting a conversation.\n\nA pleasant week for my aunt involves the grocery store, church, volunteering at her church, sitting at the library, taking the recycling to the drop-off center, and watching TV each night. It's insanely boring for me. Plus, she's very independent and doesn't need or want help shopping, cooking, cleaning, etc. I just have nothing useful or interesting to do.\n\nAny ideas? I'm within 80 minutes of Chicago downtown and within an hour of a lot of suburbs. I like sports in general, playing pool, pickup basketball (not good though), conversations about tech and news and sports. I'm game for anything where I could meet people who want to meet people, if that makes sense. I feel like I'm searching aimlessly and can \"try\" driving to all sorts of places, but holiday week hours are unpredictable and there's no guarantee it'll be worth the trip. I'm probably looking at 45-90 minutes of drive time, and my budget is limited, so I feel like I need to make good choices and not just be aimless about picking places to go.\n\nThanks!", "title": "Holiday week boredom"}, {"created_utc": 1577322729, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/chicago/comments/efonrl/is_there_a_site_that_utilizes_google_maps_or/", "id": "efonrl", "is_self": true, "score": 1, "selftext": "So I'm planning a move to Chicago and I'm just trying to learn about it, and I'm reading tons of sites, but I thought it would be really cool if there was a map I can keep on one screen to get instant info.  \n \nLike if someone told me \"Check out Lakeview, it's nice\", I can just click a checkbox to see it instantly (or have it highlighted).

The key takeaways are mostly the same as last year:\n\n* Soup is usually the least valuable appetizer- sometimes by a long shot\n* If you're going to a steakhouse, order the steak\n* Be especially careful with tapas/dim sum as they don't typically mesh well with the RW format\n* Vegetarians, you're awesome, but RW menus aren't usually designed with you in mind\n\nThis was sort of a rush job and I did the entire thing alone, so there's a small list of  assumptions I needed to make in certain cases (documented in the spreadsheet).

It wasn't a real double-doink.\n\nAnd they have a guy now who can't even doink. You had a doinker in Chicago and fired him and replaced him with a guy who can't doink. Doinking is fun, especially when you can do it three times in one afternoon and still win a football game.\n\nWhat irks me is that Parkey's own teammates were so humane that it was inspirational. \n\nThen Bears' management follows that kindness up with an abrupt firing, so that the guy can't even get a job in the NFL any more (and he was, if I am not mistaken, a pro-bowler once upon a time). Their excuse that he was grandstanding on TV doesn't fly with me. He's a young guy, forgive him for wanting his mom to see him on a TV talk show.\n\nSo there's my two-cents that I felt compelled to throw in there after watching a playoff game.\n\nIf they fired Parkey, why don't they fire the guys who did such miserable job of play-calling this year on the coaching staff?

If so, how much do you think I should pay max since you guys know Chicago way better than I do in terms of food cos?  \n  \n2) Is AirBnb/Craigslist the best way of securing such a thing or are there any sites/resources you'd suggest? Is hiring an agent a bad idea to find something for me if nothing good comes up on AirBnb?   \n  \n3) If my goal is to explore neighborhoods, how far outside of downtown should I go? Yes my friend has a vehicle but I'd really like to get use to taking the subway and moving/exploring the city alone when they're not available. I guess another way of asking this is, given my pay and my desire to explore neighborhoods until I find one I'd like to live in long-term, which neighborhoods or suburbs would you recommend I explore?  \n \n4) Is there any other advice or suggestions you can give?

I STILL agreed to this, gave him a 10, and he returns with $8. HE TIPPED HIMSELF. I almost laughed because I felt so bad, I gave another $1 to be cordial and stared him directly in the eyes. He then proceeded to slowly pour a water. Finally the last bartender, my gf asked for a Moscow and a water, but instead asked how much it would be before buying it. He said $12. Then she said oh gosh really, I thought it was a bit cheaper (Just to test the waters). He hands the Mug to another bartender, new guy starts making the drink and first guy, acting confused, goes and asks \"How much are Moscows usually?!\" The new bartender says oh yeah these, around here.... $14.

The security and bouncers were friendly. They let's us in free for the McGreggor Cowboy fight which was nice and obviously  short lived then immediately changed the video and sound over to music before watching any congratulatory speaking which looked money thirsty and people ohhed and ahhhed over that for a bit. They turned every screen into a still image and immediately obnoxiouslh loud music without a ease into it after our ears were in a *listening to talking and fighting action* mode.

I would love to as well, and am trying to learn a little bit about schools in the area, as I'll be a high school English teacher once I'm out of school. Specifically, I'm wanting to get a picture of how CPS would mandate my curriculum look and common core be applied. \n\nUtah applies the core standards, but they're really relaxed about it for the most part. For example, a lot of English departments around here choose overarching goals they see in the standards (e.g. \"critical thinking\" or \"effective communication\") rather than individually addressing each standard. I like this, as I have some of the same concerns with the core as the Chicago Teachers Union lists on their website, worrying that it will keep my curriculum from focusing on anything beyond getting students ready for college and careers. A lot of my most valuable lessons in high school came from class periods where we weren't necessarily hitting a specific common core standard, but were taking a somewhat broader view of education's goals. As one example just to illustrate more clearly, two lessons while reading a book were spent discussing and learning about sexual assault, with simply the hope that we would be better people by the end of it, not necessarily better writers or readers. I know that was a special experience in some ways, as in a lot of states spending that kind of time on a that kind of subject could never happen.\n\nWe definitely still hit the standards, ended up with strong test scores and were prepared well for college and careers, those things were never discounted. However, I enjoy the freedom Utah offers to broaden the horizons of education a bit alongside all of that important work. Living in Utah all of my life and watching teachers do this here, I know that it will be possible. But I'm not sure what the requirements and usual practices are in Chicago, especially in a district as large as CPS. If anyone--hopefully teachers in the area--has information or experiences seeing the way CPS or other Chicago districts apply common core standards to curriculum I would be extremely grateful to hear. Thank you so much.\n\ntl;dr: My home state of Utah allows a lot of freedom for teachers to determine their own curriculum.

I had just boarded at North/Clybourn when there were incomprehensible announcements made by the driver. After a few announcements that sounds like sewer lids rattling around in a rat-infested dumpster, people departed the train, and then the platform. I assumed a delay. I was willing to wait 10-15 minutes to see if things resume, so I got LO\u2019s iPad out.\n\nThen, finally, the train operator came up to me and told me to evacuate, but even then I could barely understand her because of the din.

I will have an interview for a very exciting job opportunity in Northbrook, IL in a few days. I am making this post in case I secure the job. If I were to get the job, here is my plan so far:\n\n- Housing: My friend said her parents might be willing to house me at their home in Lincoln Park (35 minute drive without traffic to potential work place).  If not I plan to airbnb. The employer (who has briefly talked with me on the phone) strongly advised that I stay in the city and not the suburbs; she said she doesn't want a young person like myself living in the suburbs. I'm also more interested in living in Chicago as opposed to Northbrook: I was born in Vietnam and moved to the US when I was 14. I've never been in an environment where I am truly a minority, and I'm truly nervous about living in a  town that's mostly white. If possible, would someone please elaborate on their experience living in either of these places?\n\n-Transportation: I'm planning on driving solo in my sedan from SD to Chicago, which is a 30 hour drive. I'm concerned about driving in the snow at this time of year (I've never even touched snow before in real life) and parking in Chicago (I've heard horror stories). I can't think of leaving my car and relying solely on public transportation though, since the job location is so far away. I know I should get snow tires for my car, but do I change them before I leave from SD, or when I get closer to Chicago? (Sorry if this is a naive question)\n\n-Funds: I was very lucky that my parents help pay for my undergrad, so I have no debt to worry about. I also managed to save up from previous jobs in uni. I won't have to worry about healthcare because it is included with the job benefits. \n\nIf anyone reading this is rolling your eyes about how unprepared and impulsive all of this is: Yes, you're absolutely right. I'm freaking out right now. But Chicago is such a beautiful city, and I want to get away from CA which is where I have spent majority of my teen and adult life. The job itself is also incredibly beneficial to my future career route, and I have not seen any jobs posted in California that matched up. I'm worried (maybe rather irrationally) that I will be fired for unforseen circumstances and all this will be for naught. However, I'm also afraid that if I don't make this move, I will regret my decision in the long run. \n\nIf anyone could help this lost frantic young adult talk the logistics of this out, I would greatly appreciate it.\n\nThank you!", "title": "Moving from San Diego, CA to Chicago.

You can log in to your account online to see if you have any active or inactive passes. \n \n&gt;**Deactivating autoload feature**: If you have autoload enabled, you can easily deactivate this feature through the Ventra app or on our website (VentraChicago.com).

Now that its been a week or two, are things getting better or worse? I know some theorized (myself included) that there really wasn't much panic buying going on. Just that everyone was doing 2 weeks worth of shopping to prepare all at once. And others thought that the panic buying was rampant.\n\nTarget's stock has improved quite a bit. Hand soaps are now 95% fully stocked and the shelves are full. Meats are now 80% full of stock where 2 weeks ago they were completely empty. Canned goods are roughly 85% restocked where they were completely 100% wiped out. Things like refrigerated pasta, frozen foods, etc are all back in stock.\n\nEverything is pretty much close to normal except a few items. Toilet Paper was still all gone. Acetaminophen is 100% out of stock. Dry pasta was still gone. And [isopropyl alcohol completely out](https://www.epa.gov/pesticide-registration/list-n-disinfectants-use-against-sars-cov-2). Those were the only things I noticed that couldn't be bought in any quantity from any brand.\n\nI also noticed that Target was almost completely void of customers at 6pm on a Sunday. In the self checkout there was an employee that just sat there and waited for someone to leave their station and it was immediately wiped down. Employees had gloves and masks on.\n\nAll things considered, if they're keeping all flavors of Jeni's Ice Cream in stock, I don't think we're going to starve to death anytime soon.

My background is in social and clinical psychology research, so my approach is informed by the literature on self-disclosure, question-asking, game theory, and some other stuff that I can nerd out about in person if you end up coming to the event and are interested in hearing me ramble for a while. But basically, we use cards with questions written on them and a lot of structure to allow people to open up to strangers more comfortably and quickly than you might usually.\n\nPeople have reported finding Skip the Small Talks useful for meeting new people, for becoming more comfortable in social situations outside of Skip the Small Talk, and for interacting with humans in a low-effort context. Some Redditors said some nice stuff about us [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BostonSocialClub/comments/b0146n/experience_with_skip_the_small_talk/) if you want to check out other people's take on it.\n\nYou can check out all our events [here](https://www.eventbrite.com/o/skip-the-small-talk-10841599652) and you if you want to keep up with our events, you can sign up for our e-mail list [here](https://www.skipthesmalltalk.org/) (I don't spam, I don't share your e-mail address with anyone, and I really genuinely do hope you'll let me know if the e-mails ever start getting annoying).\n\nIf you do end up going and if you're feeling up for it, come say hi to me and let me know what you thought!", "title": "Skip the Small Talk: Upcoming ONLINE events!"}, {"created_utc": 1585699831, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/chicago/comments/fsomr6/marianos_goose_couple/", "id": "fsomr6", "is_self": true, "score": 2, "selftext": "Some ABSOLUTE POS ran over a mama goose in the Mariano\u2019s parking lot this evening while she was protecting an egg that had fallen from the rooftop... all while the father watched helplessly.

Soups, sides, tacos, bowls, you name it. \n4. If you have an Instant Pot, it makes great yogurt, apple sauce, soups, or chicken stock. All will be cheaper than buying in the stores. Soups are easy, cheap, and are great options to freeze and store for later, Instant Pot or not. Stocks are easily made from bones or vegetables and water.\n5. Make your own salad dressings.

The base salary is 77k. I used a calculator to  get my net income after tax, and it came out to a monthly net income of  $4,200. I have approximately 60k in graduate loans, with an interest  rate of \\~8%. The calculator took into account all taxes, insurance, 401k  contribution of 6%, and additionally a monthly transportation fee of  $100 per month (I can use pretax dollars to pay transportation fees).\n\nI've  never made a budget before, so I want to know if my budgeting is  realistic and reasonable. From googling around, these are the numbers I  came up with:\n\n20% Savings, $840\n\nStudent Loans, $600\n\nGroceries/Eating out, $500\n\nPersonal Items/House supplies, $50\n\nFun, $150\n\nSubscriptions (Only Netflix and Spotify), $20\n\nInternet, $60\n\nRenter's Insurance (I don't know what this is, I just stumbled upon it in every budget), $30\n\nThe  total above is $2,250, and the remainder left is $1,950. I want to use  this remainder for rent and utilities. This is well-above the general  rule of thumb of 30% net income for rent with utilities included, which  for me is $1,300. However, my situation is that I would like to rent a  decent 1BR place because after 5 months of living alone, my girlfriend  would also graduate and move in with me. My worry is that I have to  sustain the initial 5 months of rent and utilities alone, and want to  know if its even possible with my circumstances? Should I cut a bit into  my savings % per month and allocate it elsewhere? What other budget  items did I not include? Are my estimates conservative? I also want to  know how bad this plan is financially, or if it's not completely dumb  and irresponsible? Should I just scrap this plan, and decide on living  somewhere with far less rent/utilities?\n\nI  know that I am putting too little off my student loans, but my plan was  to keep it up for the 5 months, then change my payment plan to pay it  off a bit more aggressive than how I have it now. If my hypothetical  rent/utilities is true of $1,950, I would split that with my girlfriend  later and it would then be well under the 30% rule of thumb.  My  girlfriend is to make around the same as me after she graduates. Also, I  would agree that spending nearly $2,000 is ridiculous, and that as a  new-grad, I don't have that sort of luxury to live like that. It is just  a personal desire that my girlfriend and I share. We prefer not to live  in a very small apartment. We were looking into more of the modern  apartments, and nothing of ridiculous commute. It doesn't have to be  downtown, it can be a 30 minute commute away.\n\nAdditional  info: I don't smoke, and I only drink occasionally with friends.

I hear so many gripes about being under the equivalent of \"light touch house arrest.\" Imagine having to wear an anklet that reveals your position at all times and not being able to leave your 400 square foot apartment for a year. Now imagine being locked in a 9x6 foot cell, 23 hours a day, with and having to see your cellmate take a shit every day on a seat fixed to the podium of the same sink you both use to brush your teeth.\n* If you have a job and you want to get outside but the joggers are fucking you up, why not spend $30 at Jewel and make a bunch of sandwiches for the homeless? Put on a mask and some gloves and pass out some food to people that have it much harder than you do.\n* All you joggers who (1) can't manage to run on the right side of the road, (2) see no reason to wear a mask while running, and (3) SPIT ON THE PAVEMENT WHILST RUNNING, open up that pocketbook of privilege and get your entitled ass a treadmill. I see plenty of runners doing things right. But I see way too many of them doing everything wrong.\n* Lakeview residents are going to buy us all at least another 2-4 weeks of lockdown thanks to their infuriating carelessness. Every neighborhood in this town has examples of people who feel themselves the exception to our new social contract. But Lakeview has, time and again, proven itself to have those kinds of assholes in spades. Mothers out with their infants in unprotected strollers walking shoulder-to-shoulder with Stacy and Karen\u2014none of them wearing masks. Finance bros fresh off their clandestine jerk sessions on Zoom taking to the streets without either mask or shirt to pound pavement and outrun that fat little boy they left behind in Ohio. And, of course, the gay youth, too fresh to remember the epidemic that stole from their culture an entire generation of elders that could be admonishing them now for not behaving better. (Before you come for me on this, I am a gay man myself.)\n*  But I see a ton of us are doing the right thing, and Chicago is succeeding in staving off what was, just a few weeks ago, a Biblical cataclysm. I want to get outside too. God knows I miss my friends dearly. And I'm no fan of this dad bod I'm quickly acquiring in lieu of the gym. But, all things considered, it isn't THAT bad......yet.
