It is also a major cause of death of critically ill patients, Zhou said at a news conference.\n\nHe said the Ministry of Science and Technology and the Chinese Academy of Sciences have carried out many projects that focus on discovering ways to reduce a cytokine storm and exploring new treatments by modifying the immune response and suppressing inflammation in a bid to treat critical patients.\n\nTo prevent the occurrence of a cytokine storm, scientists have screened many old drugs, including some drugs that have been proven effective in the treatment of rheumatism. After several preliminary verifications, some drugs have been put into clinical trials on 14 critical cases, with the oldest patients being 82 years old, and the results have appeared encouraging, Zhou said.\n\nHe said the comparative experiment is also underway with 94 cases in the treatment group and 94 in the control group \u2013 patients who do not receive the treatment in order to test the effectiveness of the drug.\n\n\"If the initial results prove effective, we will promote these effective treatments to critical patients as soon as possible,\" he said.\n\n\"The work on reducing the cytokine storm is still ongoing.

It may be because they are exposed to a high viral load upon infection.", "selftext": "Recently there have been several tragic deaths of young doctors in Wuhan from covid19, including the 29-year-old [Dr. Xia Sisi](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/f86hfd/xia_sisi_a_29yearold_doctor_at_a_hospital_in/), the 29-year-old [Dr. Peng Yin Hua](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/f6zxfj/29_year_old_wuhan_respirologist_and_icu_doctor_dr/), the 42-year-old [Dr. Huang Wenjun](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/f8a8vn/huang_wenjun_a_42yearold_doctor_at_a_hospital/), and of course the 34-year-old [Dr. Li Wenliang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li_Wenliang). This is at some odds with general population data showing that deaths of covid19 tend to be highly concentrated in the elderly. It could be a statistical anomaly, but it does seem like death rates may be higher in young doctors than would be expected in the population.\u00a0\n\nAs an explanation, many of the most upvoted comments on these posts suggest that their immune systems might be suppressed due to overwork, poor sleep, and stress. To me, this seems to be an extremely unlikely explanation for many reasons, including the fact that doctors don't seem to die at relatively higher rates of other infectious illnesses such as influenza.\u00a0\n\nHowever, some people have mentioned higher viral load as a possibility, which seemed more likely. I did some research and I found this 2005 study on the role of viral load in SARS (which is, of course, very similar to covid19):\u00a0[https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/11/12/pdfs/04-0949.pdf](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/11/12/pdfs/04-0949.pdf) \n\nThe study looked at an outbreak of sars in a particular housing area in Hong Kong. They found that people who had closer contact with the index patient had a higher nasopharyngeal viral load on admission as measured by RT-PCR. Crucially, they also found that people in this area were also the most likely to die. Some quotes:\u00a0\n\n\"**The median nasopharyngeal viral load in E block patients (5.09 log10 copies/mL) was much higher than in non-E block patients (0 log10 copies/mL) on admission (p&lt;0.001)**... The overall case death rate among the 79 patients was 24.1%. The highest rate was in block E, which accounted for 79% of all deaths, while the death rate in patients living in E7 (the same block as the index patient) was 70% (7 patients). This rate is significantly higher than in other units (p = 0.001 by \u03c72 test). The index patient was one of the few patients from E7 who survived the disease.\"  \n\"Severity of illness did not differ between block E patients and non-E block patients when they were first seen at the hospital, despite higher viral load in block E patients. However, the death rate was higher in block E. **We have previously demonstrated that patients with high initial and peak viral loads in nasopharyngeal samples were more likely to show a less favorable disease course and lower survival rate (8,18).** Patients living in E7 who had highest nasopharyngeal viral loads explains why their death rate was higher than for those living in other units. The dilution effect resulted in a decreased viral load as the disease spread to other units and in a lower death rate.\"\n\nThis data corroborates the viral load theory. It's not perfect evidence, but the theory also makes basic physiologic sense. A higher viral load on initial infection means that the virus will be able to do more damage and suppress the host's immune system further (lymphopenia) before the host can mount an immune response against the virus.\u00a0\n\nHospital workers are likely to be exposed to especially high viral loads of covid19. People who are hospitalized with covid19 infections are likely to cough more and require close contact for procedures such as IV placement and intubation. It is hard to know for sure, but healthcare transmission risk may have been especially high in the early stages of the epidemic in Wuhan, when people were not as aware of the high mortality rates of this disease.\u00a0\n\nIf viral load upon initial infection correlates with disease severity, this may also help to explain why some local clusters seem to have more severe disease, such as the family who all died of the disease. For some reason, people in these clusters may have been exposed to an especially high viral load. Ideally, we could measure the viral load of infected people with RT-PCR to test this, although it's hard enough to get basic yes/no tests for covid19 at this point.\u00a0\n\nThe viral load theory is not rock solid. It may not explain a large percentage of the variance in disease severity - certainly age seems to be a larger factor. But to me, it is clearly the leading theory why a disproportionate number of young doctors without apparent pre-existing health problems have died of covid19 in Wuhan.\u00a0\n\nHealthcare workers putting themselves at risk to care for the sick during this pandemic are heroes. It is an urgent priority to have sufficient PPE available to our healthcare staff. We also need to have adequate space available to allow for the adequate distancing of staff and possibly infected patients. The viral load theory suggests that PPE and distancing are not only important for preventing healthcare workers from getting the illness but also decreasing the likelihood that they will die of the illness if they are infected.", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/f8lofv/why_are_so_many_young_doctors_dying_of_covid19_in/", "created_utc": 1582517846}, {"id": "f90i3w", "title": "WHO says it no longer uses 'pandemic' category, but virus still emergency.", "selftext": " [https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-china-health-who/who-says-it-no-longer-uses-pandemic-category-but-virus-still-emergency-idUKKCN20I0PD?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=worldNews](https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-china-health-who/who-says-it-no-longer-uses-pandemic-category-but-virus-still-emergency-idUKKCN20I0PD?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=worldNews) \n\nThere will be no declaration of a worldwide pandemic!!! ...

Normally they will be stored in morgue until the funeral. But what had happened in China is some hospital quickly run out of space. Dead bodies can also be source for further spreading of the virus. So what the Chinese government did is immediately transfer the bodies away, not storing them in the hospital, to protect the medical staff and other patients in hospital. \n2. Bodies in China were immediately cremated after death. Cremation has been the standard procedure in China for a while. During time of pandemic, this would be the best way to treat a body. However, I know burial is the most common way. I think the government really need to think about it whether they can cremate instead bury bodies, but I know it will be very hard to do so. And funerals should be pushed off as well, but storing bodies with virus for a long time is not good for controlling the situation.\n3. As the virus keeps spreading, eventually, there will be dead cases for un-diagnosed patients. Ideally, we want to figure out the cause of death. During a time that living patients are waiting in line to be tested, I'm not sure whether they can be tested. China just cremate those bodies, which caused an underestimation of the real death account, and also triggered huge controversy. But I don't know if there is a better way of handling it in situations like that. \n\nThose are some issues came to my mind. I know it's a sad topic, and people probably don't want to think about it.

Curious if anyone can list actual epidemiological studies on this.\n\nMy background (anecdotal study, n=1): I've worn N95/R95 masks regularly to commute/work for the past 10 years. First, in Asia in dense traffic I wore R95 mostly to block VOCs/PM or whatever the diesel buses/trucks were spewing, in very hot/humid conditions while sweating profusely. I had a beard, and I reused the same mask usually for several weeks (until it got too nasty). I had a very clear ongoing daily \"fit test\" of \"can I smell the nasty shit in the air right now?\" - even after a couple weeks of use, the answer was that it blocked maybe 90-95% of the stink/PM. There was also the *massive* reducing in respiratory irritation I suffered after switching to the masks. This led me to believe that even without a perfect fit or whatever, the masks work pretty damn well.\n\nLater on I started doing construction work. The N95 dust masks are ubiquitous, and lots of guys wear them almost all day doing aerobic-ish exercise, myself included, hours a day, same mask reused for a week or two, with an even larger beard now. I can literally see the stuff in the air I'm using the mask to block, dust everywhere, and even with \"not following the rules\" it clearly blocks the vast majority of particles, with a severe reduction in the \"my lungs hurt\" thing after work. And yes, I can still breathe with the mask on.\n\nI get that \"it just takes one viral particle\", but in my experience the masks even when used improperly will block the vast majority of whatever it is in the air, and the vast majority of the airflow entering the mask will go through the filter rather than the gaps when fitted properly (by a layman, even bearded). I'm not sure if the masks getting humid from your breath will allow the viral particles to somehow worm through the damp filter and then get sucked in to your lungs? What exactly is the concern there?\n\nAlso I'm pretty sure they'll be far more effective at blocking viral particles being emitted from the wearer, which probably is more of a concern. But I can't say the number of times in life I've been in direct contact with someone clearly contagiously coughing (as opposed to nervously, ofc), and presto bango 2-3 days later I come down sick from whatever they were expelling into the air. I get that 99% of the time in public you're not going to be subjected to direct aerosols, but I'm also aware you're wearing the mask for that 1% of the time you're stuck next to someone on the train who should've stayed home and is filling the air around you with their disease.", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/fcdikh/actual_statisticallybased_studies_on_mask_usage/", "created_utc": 1583162287}, {"id": "fcf4r4", "title": "[question] Do we have any first hand accounts of the virus?", "selftext": "I'm admittedly super anxious and paranoid about the virus.

The most common way of getting infected is by touching things in public, so you must wash your hands frequently. The virus can only live on your hands for 5-10 mins, but a lot can happen in those 5-10 mins (you can rub your eyes or pick your nose unwittingly).\n1. \u901a\u5e38\u6700\u6709\u53ef\u80fd\u611f\u67d3\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u662f\u5728\u516c\u5171\u5834\u5408\u89f8\u6478\u4e86\u5e36\u6709\u75c5\u6bd2\u7684\u7269\u9ad4\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u8a18\u5f97\u52e4\u6d17\u624b\u3002\u75c5\u6bd2\u5728\u4f60\u624b\u4e0a\u53ea\u6703\u5b58\u6d3b5-10\u5206\u9418\uff0c\u4e0d\u904e\u5373\u4f7f\u662f\u77ed\u77ed\u76845-10\u5206\u9418\uff0c\u4e5f\u8981\u5341\u5206\u8b66\u60d5\uff08\u4e0d\u8981\u7528\u624b\u63c9\u773c\u775b\u6216\u8005\u4e0d\u81ea\u89ba\u5730\u6473\u9f3b\u5b50\ud83d\ude04\uff09\n\n2.

My previous employment was a small sized company with a giant cess pool of illness-spreading employees. Having been given no official \u201csick time\u201d just PTO (general Paid Time Off) they would constant work sick and regularly spread whatever virus throughout the office as common practice. As someone who rarely gets sick, I found myself catching more and more colds/infections as time went on. The pure lack of consideration and stupidity of it all was sickening in itself.\n\nSo now here I am, with only family and I in close quarters. I\u2019ve limited my outings in the past couple weeks due mostly to hunkering down on completing projects for work and growing concerns of the virus (to a lesser extent); until today. \n\nI\u2019ve ventured out to a social dinner/theater in support of a close family member who has spent weeks directing and coordinating the event. Having sat with some close family members and a handful of random people at a round table, the predictable small-talk ensued; including weather, daylight-savings, and Coronavirus. The pure ignorance of the general public in regards to the virus is astounding. Having come to light for myself today after reading/studying the virus\u2019s impact for over 2 months now, it is more than unsettling.\n\nThis is where paranoia set in.\n\nClosely watching social interactions, several people coughing and sneezing all over, close talking, no seeming consideration for anyone or anything. Buffet style, over a 100 people touching doors, chairs, tables; using the same tongs and grabbing food with their hands, then just eating without washing prior... \n\nAnxiety sets in and all self-conscious questionings ensue... My utensils, glass, plates... who has touched them... are they clean? What if one single person in this room is indeed infected, how many more could this spread to just from this event, then how many from here on out exponentially?!\n\nPure.  Fucking.  Anxiety.\n\nHave I just become a vigilant germaphobe or am I just paranoid? Right now, in the US, we may not have a definite answer, but I believe I will not be going out socially again (to this degree) until all of this has passed; at least for my own sanity and piece of mind.\n\nStay vigilant, have social consideration, and practice regular cleanliness and hygiene.
