Most of the public UC system (excluding Berkeley) have quarters, while the CSU system has recently switched over to the semester system. Looking abroad, Oxford and Cambridge each have three academic terms which are roughly eight weeks long, with over a month off from early December to mid January and mid March to late April.\n\nThis past spring, the university indicated that it is considering switching to a semester system, [forming a committee](https://www.chicagomaroon.com/article/2019/3/18/university-convenes-calendar-committee-discuss-pos/) to explore changes to the academic calendar. An [op-ed](https://www.chicagomaroon.com/article/2019/4/13/quarter-system-quandary/) soon followed in the Maroon, arguing that the quarter system should not be a scapegoat for broader issues of academic stress and mental health.\n\nSome typical arguments in favor are that it would reduce endless tests, stress, administrative overhead, and that semesters better align with start dates for internships and jobs. Some typical arguments against are that the quarter system is integral to the school's identity and that it's both more academically rigorous and more flexible - students can take more subjects and professors won't be tempted to add filler to their curricula.\n\nIn your opinion, should UChicago keep the quarter system?

I\u2019m currently enrolled in the honors econ sequence, and trying to get math prerequisites (I began in the 150s) out of the way ASAP. I know I\u2019ve got a long way to go, but what frustrates me most right now is getting involved in research. I do not have any background in statistical stuff (R/Stata, and I\u2019m planning to take STAT 244 and Econometrics in the following quarters), and I also didn\u2019t join Oeconomica cause I was not expecting myself to get this deep into econ. But anyhow, I like studying economics and I wanted to study beyond the undergrad level, hence my interest in research.  Now, I\u2019ve talked to professors in the department and research advisors and all that, but I wanted to get advice from peers or those who\u2019ve already gone through all of this. These are  some questions regarding specific points: \n\n1. I know most econ research jobs require data analysis skills. The thing is, I\u2019m not taking econometrics until 2021 fall (my 3rd year) at best and I fear I\u2019ll not be eligible for most RA positions in my 2nd year summer (2020 Summer). Have any of you guys been in a similar situation in which you had to self-educate yourself during the school year so you could gain that eligibility? If anyone knows any good resources (RSOs, programs, workshops) around campus that you could utilize to educate yourself, it\u2019d be great to hear about them. \n\n2. I was recommended that I try out the Summer Institute in Social Sciences Research (SISRM) RA program in the Summer, as it selects some students and give them a chance to get involved in research. I was just wondering if there was anyone who has done/applied to this program, cause there isn\u2019t much info on this program and I was worried that it would require prior knowledge of data analyzing skills. I just thought it\u2019d be great to be able to talk in general about this program with anyone who has experienced it.\n\n3. I\u2019m doing my homework as I was told to do \u2014 I\u2019m surfing through the econ professors and preparing to reach out to any professors whose research genuinely interests me. Honestly, I\u2019m pretty nervous because I\u2019ve never done this before and I feel like I can contribute very little (skill-wise) to the professors\u2019 research. It\u2019d be great if I could gain more insight into this general \u2018process\u2019 of reaching out to the professors. Tips? Do\u2019s and dont\u2019s? \n\n4. Everyone tells me that it\u2019s ok to have a short, underwhelming Curriculum Vitae up to this point: I haven\u2019t much Research experience. This wouldn\u2019t be much of an anomaly, right? \n\n5. Finally, I was originally thinking about majoring in English lit/Creative writing. I\u2019m still really interested in that too, and I take classes, run writers\u2019 workshops, and do all that stuff. I was also thinking about finding a research in that area, maybe alongside my econ coursework. Would it be better for me to really focus on doing what an econ grad school would expect me to instead of going for various things I liked? Some tell me that it\u2019s ok for me to engage in various fields while some recommend that I prune my interests. \n\nRereading this, I do sound like one anxious undergrad. I guess I\u2019m concerned about that I set my foot a tad bit late into econ and just want to make most out of my time left here. Finding someone who\u2019s thought of econ grad school is hard for me (I don\u2019t know why...I do know a ton of econ majors but not much who\u2019re on the same track as I am).\nBut anyways, thanks guys for reading my long rant, and hope you all a merry Christmas!", "title": "Tips on Econ Undergrad Research"}, {"created_utc": 1577218982, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/uchicago/comments/ef6keq/woodlawn/", "id": "ef6keq", "is_self": true, "score": 1, "selftext": "How far is it from classes and places we will need to get to?

During my senior year I had an extreme case of OCD, anxiety, and depression that caused me to miss a lot of school. I took IB and my final IB scores were much lower than my predicted scores. I was predicted a 42 and received a 34. I took 3 of my exams in May and the remaining 3 in November. I should mention that I took a gap year (now I am class of 2024) to recover my health and try to prepare for the remaining three exams. \n\nWithin the last week, I received a letter from the office of admissions to explain my circumstances. I sent in my letter and got a response that they were referring it to the admissions review committee, saying that my scores were still below average even when I had extra time because I took a gap year. During my extra time, I should add, that I was still very sick and depressed, so it was very hard for me to study. Not to mention, I had very poor teachers and was often my own self teacher. \n\nDuring the 6 months from May to November I was seeing a therapist and doctor. I now take medication that has helped me immensely, and I was sure to write that in my letter explaining my circumstances. \n\nI did not fail any classes by the way. I received a 4 in one and a 5 in another, with my remaining scores being 6s. While these scores aren\u2019t great, I still passed. \n\nDoes anyone think that the school will rescind my offer, even with severe mental health issues and legitimate extenuating circumstances? The school seems to think I have no excuse because I had extra time, even though during that time I was still sick.

There\u2019s still a grace period for six months after (when interest starts incurring). \n\n\u2022 A third to half my loans will be interest free forever (or unless my province is taken over by another political party who wishes to incur the wrath of students). \n\n\u2022 I\u2019ll also only have to start paying my student loans back if I make a certain amount of money. No interest will be incurred if I\u2019m unemployed or don\u2019t make enough. \n\n**To anyone shelling out nearly the whole cost\u2014and to those grad students who have student debt from undergrad degrees already, how are you doing it?** \n\nPrivate loans? Lines of credit? Something else? \n\nShould I defer for a year?

At the same time, I feel guilty for being bus econ because I will be grouped with a bunch of people who probably aren't that passionate about economics. I really enjoy the process of thinking about econ, and am afraid of going down the business route because I know it isn't as econ focused--- BUT I know it is better for my future.

I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing with my life?\n\nUChicago (Molecular engineering)\n\nPros: the major fits my interests of applying science on a small scale and very interdisciplinary, study humanities, community/housing/traditions, into the \u201clearn for sake of learning\u201d vibe, collaborative, into the idea of listening in on a philosophical discussion at the dining table for 3 hours\n\nCons: Chicago, might not have the same interests throughout my four years, no other engineering majors (and i might be into engineering), not super entrepreneurial/applied, newer/unknown major that seems to be constantly changing, no special perks like columbia egleston, majorly econ, idk if i can study abroad\n\nColumbia (mat sci with bioeng minor)\n\nPros: egleston program (good connections with dean, advising, 10k stipend), many engineering majors, can study humanities, NYC (my dream!!!), flexible engineering major\n\nCons: mat sci is very condensed matter physics focused and im more into chem/bio and its also a really small major, not as community-oriented as uchicago, seems like people are very go-go-go, stress/individualistic culture, very finance-y, taking classes with grad students, idk if i can study abroad\n\nBerkeley M.E.T. program (mat sci + business)\n\nPros: entrepreneurship/business seems really interesting/exciting (never done it before), regents, M.E.T. gives good opportunities/community, half the cost\n\nCons: lack of course/major flexibility (eg not many biomaterials courses i can fit in and the mat sci courses aren\u2019t as interesting to me), won\u2019t be able to study humanities as much, want to try something different from california, very tech-y\n\nI change my mind every 30 minutes so any thoughts are appreciated.

I pay like 1600 in car insurance a year and I would also have to pay for gas and from what I've seen I'd have a lot for parking as well. My dad has offered to keep my car for me where he lives in Atlanta if I don't want to deal with all the fees that comes with having a car in Chicago. That being said, if I leave it with him, Atlanta is way too far to have access if I ever do need my car, so it would be either I have one or not. I'm currently leaning towards leaving it with my dad because the public transportation look pretty good and I honestly prefer riding the bus/train to driving anyways. If it makes a difference I'll be in the CIR program. What do you guys think? Worth having the car or not?", "title": "Bringing a car as a graduate student?"}]
