Most of the public UC system (excluding Berkeley) have quarters, while the CSU system has recently switched over to the semester system. Looking abroad, Oxford and Cambridge each have three academic terms which are roughly eight weeks long, with over a month off from early December to mid January and mid March to late April.\n\nThis past spring, the university indicated that it is considering switching to a semester system, [forming a committee](https://www.chicagomaroon.com/article/2019/3/18/university-convenes-calendar-committee-discuss-pos/) to explore changes to the academic calendar. An [op-ed](https://www.chicagomaroon.com/article/2019/4/13/quarter-system-quandary/) soon followed in the Maroon, arguing that the quarter system should not be a scapegoat for broader issues of academic stress and mental health.\n\nSome typical arguments in favor are that it would reduce endless tests, stress, administrative overhead, and that semesters better align with start dates for internships and jobs. Some typical arguments against are that the quarter system is integral to the school's identity and that it's both more academically rigorous and more flexible - students can take more subjects and professors won't be tempted to add filler to their curricula.\n\nIn your opinion, should UChicago keep the quarter system?

I\u2019m currently enrolled in the honors econ sequence, and trying to get math prerequisites (I began in the 150s) out of the way ASAP. I know I\u2019ve got a long way to go, but what frustrates me most right now is getting involved in research. I do not have any background in statistical stuff (R/Stata, and I\u2019m planning to take STAT 244 and Econometrics in the following quarters), and I also didn\u2019t join Oeconomica cause I was not expecting myself to get this deep into econ. But anyhow, I like studying economics and I wanted to study beyond the undergrad level, hence my interest in research.  Now, I\u2019ve talked to professors in the department and research advisors and all that, but I wanted to get advice from peers or those who\u2019ve already gone through all of this. These are  some questions regarding specific points: \n\n1. I know most econ research jobs require data analysis skills. The thing is, I\u2019m not taking econometrics until 2021 fall (my 3rd year) at best and I fear I\u2019ll not be eligible for most RA positions in my 2nd year summer (2020 Summer). Have any of you guys been in a similar situation in which you had to self-educate yourself during the school year so you could gain that eligibility? If anyone knows any good resources (RSOs, programs, workshops) around campus that you could utilize to educate yourself, it\u2019d be great to hear about them. \n\n2. I was recommended that I try out the Summer Institute in Social Sciences Research (SISRM) RA program in the Summer, as it selects some students and give them a chance to get involved in research. I was just wondering if there was anyone who has done/applied to this program, cause there isn\u2019t much info on this program and I was worried that it would require prior knowledge of data analyzing skills. I just thought it\u2019d be great to be able to talk in general about this program with anyone who has experienced it.\n\n3. I\u2019m doing my homework as I was told to do \u2014 I\u2019m surfing through the econ professors and preparing to reach out to any professors whose research genuinely interests me. Honestly, I\u2019m pretty nervous because I\u2019ve never done this before and I feel like I can contribute very little (skill-wise) to the professors\u2019 research. It\u2019d be great if I could gain more insight into this general \u2018process\u2019 of reaching out to the professors. Tips? Do\u2019s and dont\u2019s? \n\n4. Everyone tells me that it\u2019s ok to have a short, underwhelming Curriculum Vitae up to this point: I haven\u2019t much Research experience. This wouldn\u2019t be much of an anomaly, right? \n\n5. Finally, I was originally thinking about majoring in English lit/Creative writing. I\u2019m still really interested in that too, and I take classes, run writers\u2019 workshops, and do all that stuff. I was also thinking about finding a research in that area, maybe alongside my econ coursework. Would it be better for me to really focus on doing what an econ grad school would expect me to instead of going for various things I liked? Some tell me that it\u2019s ok for me to engage in various fields while some recommend that I prune my interests. \n\nRereading this, I do sound like one anxious undergrad. I guess I\u2019m concerned about that I set my foot a tad bit late into econ and just want to make most out of my time left here. Finding someone who\u2019s thought of econ grad school is hard for me (I don\u2019t know why...I do know a ton of econ majors but not much who\u2019re on the same track as I am).\nBut anyways, thanks guys for reading my long rant, and hope you all a merry Christmas!", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/uchicago/comments/ef5c3j/tips_on_econ_undergrad_research/", "created_utc": 1577213163}, {"id": "ef6keq", "title": "Woodlawn", "selftext": "How far is it from classes and places we will need to get to?

During my senior year I had an extreme case of OCD, anxiety, and depression that caused me to miss a lot of school. I took IB and my final IB scores were much lower than my predicted scores. I was predicted a 42 and received a 34. I took 3 of my exams in May and the remaining 3 in November. I should mention that I took a gap year (now I am class of 2024) to recover my health and try to prepare for the remaining three exams. \n\nWithin the last week, I received a letter from the office of admissions to explain my circumstances. I sent in my letter and got a response that they were referring it to the admissions review committee, saying that my scores were still below average even when I had extra time because I took a gap year. During my extra time, I should add, that I was still very sick and depressed, so it was very hard for me to study. Not to mention, I had very poor teachers and was often my own self teacher. \n\nDuring the 6 months from May to November I was seeing a therapist and doctor. I now take medication that has helped me immensely, and I was sure to write that in my letter explaining my circumstances. \n\nI did not fail any classes by the way. I received a 4 in one and a 5 in another, with my remaining scores being 6s. While these scores aren\u2019t great, I still passed. \n\nDoes anyone think that the school will rescind my offer, even with severe mental health issues and legitimate extenuating circumstances? The school seems to think I have no excuse because I had extra time, even though during that time I was still sick.

I will never forgive myself for turning down this opportunity. \n\nI just have to figure out how I can make this plan work. \n\nUChicago\u2019s costs are *insane* to me. \n\n\u2022 $52,000 USD per year for tuition\n\n\u2022 $4,500 USD per year for health insurance. (WTF?!?! Seriously, WTF?! I paid $172 USD per year in Canada! I don\u2019t think my entire undergrad tuition and fees per year were even $6,000 USD.) \n\n\u2022 ???? for textbooks and school supplies \n\n\u2022 $1,200 USD for studio rent and food per month\n\nI got a bit of scholarship from UChicago, but that probably just covers health insurance, other fees, and some textbooks. \n\nHere\u2019s my plan: \n\nI\u2019ll ask for scholarship reconsideration when the form is available. I don\u2019t know how much they\u2019ll care about offers from Canadian schools, though. :/ I didn\u2019t apply to other fancy schools, so how much leverage do I have? \n\nSearching for scholarships from elsewhere is more difficult than I thought. (So many are offered to students studying in Canada or just don\u2019t fit my profile.) I\u2019ll keep looking. \n\nI\u2019m planning to get a summer job (or two) in whatever. I\u2019m an independent contractor right now and only have a bit of money to receive. \n\nI can\u2019t get my family to hand me money. \n\nMy main plan is to get student loans in Canada. I think the terms are pretty favourable: \n\n\u2022 The loans will come with maybe $3,000 USD per year in grants. \n\n\u2022 Interest only starts incurring after the program ends. There\u2019s still a grace period for six months after (when interest starts incurring). \n\n\u2022 A third to half my loans will be interest free forever (or unless my province is taken over by another political party who wishes to incur the wrath of students). \n\n\u2022 I\u2019ll also only have to start paying my student loans back if I make a certain amount of money. No interest will be incurred if I\u2019m unemployed or don\u2019t make enough. \n\n**To anyone shelling out nearly the whole cost\u2014and to those grad students who have student debt from undergrad degrees already, how are you doing it?** \n\nPrivate loans?

I got a pretty pitiful amount of funding, and I have applied for a scholarship revision.

My family is willing to cover one quarter each year. I\u2019m hoping uchicago will cover the second, and I plan to cover the third with a combination of fafsa loans, work-study, and my own savings, with the rest going towards health insurance, cost of living and keeping me afloat while I look for a job this fall. I can also probably cash out my stocks if I need to. If I don\u2019t get the scholarship increase, I intend to just ask for a deferral and see what happens. \n\nI guess my question is: how doable is this? Any thoughts or specific advice on the plan?

I don't necessarily care what if you're an MA or PhD student or if you're in a similar field as me. I don't function well in a chaotic home environment so I need someone who cleans up after themself, especially in the kitchen.

I was supposed to visit both schools this spring, but with corona, I wasn\u2019t able to do that so I haven\u2019t gotten to experience the feel of either campus yet. UChi is about $20k/year more expensive than Fordham for me, but I would graduate w $20-25k in loans at most (without taking into consideration jobs or paid internships) which will probably not be too crippling for me. \n\nHere are some things about me:\n(1) I do genuinely like to learn. However, high school these past few years has not been interesting to me, so my work ethic has suffered terribly. Ive procrastinated on everything this year and last, but still manage to get my things done. UChicago would definitely be a wake up call. That\u2019s probably a good thing, but I\u2019m afraid that I won\u2019t be able to learn how to effectively study before my GPA begins to haunt me for the next 8 years. I miss enjoying the content I\u2019m learning. I went to a private preparatory middle school where I got my ass kicked because it was so hard, but I loved to learn and read shit for fun. Then I moved to a big public high school and got good grades but I\u2019m never interested in the things I\u2019m learning. Obviously a 12 year old is a hell of a lot different than a 18 year old, so I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the content or my personality changing. \n\n(2) I do not know what I want to do with my life. Maybe something business-y. Definitely not chemistry. I don\u2019t think I want to sell my soul to McKinsey, but I also don\u2019t know what I\u2019m interested in doing or becoming. \n\n(3) I also want to be able to have internships to figure out what I want to do with my life. One of the main pros for Fordham for me right now is how much the school encourages its students to get internships during the semester and its free transportation passes into Manhattan for students holding an internship. I know Uchicago has a LOT more money to spend on students and summer internships can be paid for even if they are unpaid internships which Fordham does not have, but I also want my summers to work. I want to be a summer camp counselor at least once, but I also don\u2019t want to fall behind my classmates if I\u2019m not interning and networking all summer. \n\n(3) I want a social life. I\u2019ve heard that a lot of UChicago are depressed and anxious compared to similarly ranked school. No one from my school has gone to UChicago in a very long time, so I don\u2019t have any people to reach out to and ask about their experiences. I get seasonal depression some years, but I\u2019ve also lived in the Midwest most of my life so I\u2019m pretty used to it. I just don\u2019t know how that will change once I have a college workload. I\u2019m not going to get much better weather in NY of course, but Fordham students also don\u2019t have a quarter system or as many classes with UChicago-level difficulty, so I don\u2019t know the mental health stuff there. \n\nThis was longer than I meant for it to be, but how do I determine if UChicago is worth it?
