[{"id": "e4lq8b", "title": "Feeling like everyone I'm surrounded by doesn't understand my life. Vent/Rant", "selftext": "Throwaway since this will probably come off as pretentious/playing the victim but I just want to blow off some steam.\n\nFirst off I love law school, but I feel like literally everyone in my life is very superficial and sort of dismisses how much work it is - I get the sense they think I'm just being overly worried when I talk about how much work school is or how hard working in Big Law will be after.  I feel like my parents see me as a $retirement plan$ and just keep telling me to \"push through it.\"  My friends think I'm just being overly neurotic about trying to study for finals.  I explain over and over again that finals are 100% of the grade and not everyone can get an A and for some reason it doesn't stick - I explain it every semester but I still feel like they think I'm making that up to overexaggerate/emphasize how stressful it is - then if I get good grades they are like \"see you've always done well in school you worried over nothing.\"\n\nWhen I told my friends how expensive law school was they thought I was overexaggerating.  I had to literally pull it up on my phone to prove it to them and my parents too.  When I told them about a scholarship offer I got they kind of shrugged and said cool.   Then when I told them I got into \\*flashy name brand school\\* they basically screamed up and down with excitement and couldn't stop talking about how awesome it's going to be to have that diploma hanging in my office one day and keep talking about how much money I'm going to make.  \"You could be one of those attorneys who makes like $800k/yr.\"  Ummm...maybe 20 years from now if I'm super lucky and not burned out?\n\nI worked as a SA this summer but all my friends heard was \"summer intern\" and didn't quite get it.  Basically they only understand \"law degree\" or \"no law degree\" and right now I'm in the \"no law degree\" category.  One of my friends stopped by my office and when we left together she said \"Wait so why do you get your own office?  Are you like the manager of all of the paralegals?\"   It just felt like she hadn't been listening the entire summer when I told her I was working my ass off and billing out hours, etc.  I don't mean to imply that paralegals don't work hard (they absolutely do), but it just felt like my friend didn't care to actually understand my role and what I do during the day, and basically assumed I was licking envelopes or getting coffee or something for \"experience\" and \"networking.\"\n\nAlso the older attorneys at the law firm I worked at kept telling me not to worry about grades - they don't matter, that finding a job isn't that hard, the tuition will be easy to pay off, etc.   Yeah maybe back in the 80s and 90s when you guys went to school but not now.  It's super competitive.\n\nI made law review and my dad couldn't wait to brag about it to his friends (one who is an attorney).  He even admit he doesn't really know what law review is, but just knows it's a big deal in law school.  He also thinks I'm the smartest person ever and basically implied that most people at my school don't deserve to be there.  \"Of course you made law review, you're probably the smartest person at your school.  Everyone else there is just richer - not smarter.\"  No, dad, that's really not how law school admissions works.  And the whole comment just made me feel like he didn't care or believe how hard I worked - just thought \"of course you got it you're smart.\"  Ugh.  I really want my parents to come to class with me or something - I think their world would get absolutely ROCKED by how smart everyone there is.\n\nTL;DR: I guess I just feel like no one in my life really takes me seriously and assumes that their limited knowledge of what being a lawyer is like is clearly more accurate than my actual, personal knowledge of being in law school and working at a law firm.   Maybe I just hang out with a bunch of superficial or stupid people but it just feels like they don't really respect me and probably won't until I graduate and pass the bar, which just seems off.", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/e4lq8b/feeling_like_everyone_im_surrounded_by_doesnt/", "created_utc": 1575226527}, {"id": "e4o03o", "title": "Assumption of Risk Doctrine in Criminal Procedure?", "selftext": "my crim pro professor was nice enough to give us a breakdown of the topics that the exam will cover. one of the topics is \"searches and the assumption of risk doctrine\".\n\ni don't know where that comes from. i don't remember it from the readings and i don't see it in any crim pro supplements. googling assumption of risk only gives the tort doctrine. \n\nthe only thing i can think is that it refers to the suspect/defendant assuming risk when talking to 3rd parties, and whether they can trust that 3rd party won't talk to the police?", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/e4o03o/assumption_of_risk_doctrine_in_criminal_procedure/", "created_utc": 1575235426}, {"id": "e4r6ay", "title": "Fordham\u2019s Reputation", "selftext": "Hey everybody, I was wondering if it\u2019s worth it to attend Fordham\u2019s Law School next year.

I passed the July 2019 bar exam and began working with my dad at his law firm. I've been battling depression ever since and i truly am questioning if law school was a huge mistake or if I am going through something a lot of new lawyers go through. \n\nThis profession seems overwhelming. It feels like no matter how hard you try, the work life balance will never be what you hope it could be. Answering to clients, deadlines, judges, etc feels like it will rob me of a lot of what i value in life. I loved law school. A lot. I loved learning about the law and discussing it. However, the practice of law seems to be quite different. I find myself doubting if that is what i want to do for the next 40 years. I am being compensated well and i have the ability to take over my dad's practice and make it whatever i want it to be, but i just don't know if that's what i want to do. \n\nOn top of all this, i feel so unprepared to be an attorney. Like law school entirely failed me. It feels like i have forgotten everything and it has me wanting to jump ship just about every single day. My brother works at a digital marketing firm and is now expecting his second child. He seems so happy to be working where he is and everything seems to be working out for him. He comes home and can leave his work at the office. Lower stakes and he has upward mobility. Seeing other people working undergrad type jobs makes me question if being a lawyer is the best route. They all seem much happier than i currently am, and frankly I do not make a whole lot more than they do. My earning capacity is higher, but these last few months have taught me so clearly that money does not equate to happiness. Not even close. I have a beautiful wife who tells me to just give it some time, but I just don't know if this is what i want out of life. I have thought about practicing for a few years and then going back to try and teach at my old law school but that wouldn't be for a while. \n\nI know i am rambling, but i guess my question is whether or not this is a normal feeling? Is it normal to just feel scared, overwhelmed and depressed coming out of law school? I was expecting to be so much happier finding out i had passed the bar and all that, but instead i just feel empty. I don't hear any attorney's tell me how great this career is. Everyone just makes the future seem so bleak in this career. \n\nI am well aware of the challenges that may exist in trying to enter the standard workforce with a JD and being a licensed attorney, but I am in such a miserable spot right now that i am not ruling anything out. Help me find some clarity. \n\nTL:DR - 24 y/o attorney. Overwhelmed and depressed. This profession doesn't feel like what i thought it would be. Want to jump ship.

This might be a badly worded question with an obvious answer but I've spent almost all day on mens rea and I'm still so incredibly confused and can't move on to other things. \n\nUnder MPC 2.02(4)  It says that culpability level applies to all material elements of an offense UNLESS a contrary purpose plainly appears. \n\n1. What could be a \"contrary purpose\"?? I feel like I missed something from class and I can't find the answer anywhere.\n2. Is this code saying that if you have a mens rea term in an offense, that term then applies to all the material elements of that offense? So if we have this burglary statute: \"Breaking and entering the dwelling house of another at night with the **intent (purpose/knowledge)** to commit a felony therein\", by following MPC 2.02(4) wouldn't that mean \"intent\" now applies to all the other material elements besides just \"commit a felony\", like \"at night\", and \"dwelling house\"??                             \n  \nBUT, I was taught we are supposed to read the mens rea term as applying to what comes after it (common sense, like in Flores v. Figueroa), and not apply it to what comes before. So if we do that and are applying the mens rea term only to the element \"commit a felony therein\", would that mean the material elements before intent are now under the \"default\" mental state of **recklessness** under the MPC ? (Default according to MPC 2.02(3): \"recklessness applies whenever the offense definition fails to specify the culpability with respect to a particular element\")\n3. By trying to understand the above I also want to understand how to answer this question: If X believes he is entering the dwelling house of another in the daytime and does not even suspect that it may be nighttime, what is the result under the MPC and why?                                                                                                                                     \n\nI hope I am coherent.

I realize without school, state, etc. advice will be limited, but I'd like to get as far out in front as I can.  There are a few issues I am assuming will come up:\n\n\\- Other than honorable discharge from the military.  Had some range ammo/protechnics in my quarters, as well as an unregistered firearm.  Arrested for larceny, no conviction, requested and approved for discharge in lieu of court martial.  This happened over a decade ago.\n\n\\- This past June, arrested for narcotics charges.  Released, no charges.  I do not know how this will show on a background check and my state takes forever to adjudicate even cases with no charges, which can sit for years as \"pending\". Long story but I was with a law enforcement agency fraught with corruption and careerism and was naive thinking I would change things and got myself fucked. Was already planning on leaving for school, but caused a huge shift in focus, and was the topic of my PS. &lt;/tangent&gt;.  Aside from the obvious issue, a good portion of the administration at this employer will go out of their way to fuck me if given the chance (for instance if contacted by a Bar investigator).\n\n\\- I have a pretty long work history and am having a hard time coming up with accurate contact info... some places, I just don't remember names, and those businesses have not been able to provide the info.  Some places I know I just won't be able to  dig up the info... private military contracting, out of business companies, etc..  I started looking for applications, but thankfully didn't need it.  I assume I will for the Bar.\n\n\\- I was a bit hasty in general with applications... I used my standard resume which has just been a working document for over a decade, without verifying actual dates, etc.. Did not pull my traffic record, stopped trying for my juvenile record after a court clerk told me it would not be archived and there was no way for me to get it.  I basically just worked off of memory... stupid.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKnowing (a little) better three months into the cycle here is my plan:\n\nResearch and verify resume, traffic/juvenile (if possible) record.

Maybe even the worst grade of your life. \n\nI remember after my first semester, I was in the bottom 10% of a class I really thought I\u2019d mastered, a class that I thought was essential to my career goals. I seriously considered dropping out because I thought no one would hire me. \n\nTurns out, I got several competitive internships and post-grad employment in that field, and no one ever asked me about my crappy grade from 1L. I got to help a lot of people in some drastic ways before I later realized that the field wasn\u2019t for me. But I eventually landed in a job I love. I wake up every day excited to go to work, and no one cares about my grades in law school (or even really where I went to law school).\n\nLawyers are trained to be pessimists, to see all of the worst possible outcomes and work to prevent them. But try not to be a pessimist about yourself. Misery and ruin are *not* inevitabilities. You can be happy and have a fulfilling career even if you barely passed Civ Pro. \n\nAnd good news! Work as a lawyer is not at all like work in law school. And the law is such a diverse field that I\u2019m convinced there\u2019s *some* kind of practice that would appeal to anyone. It may take a few years after you graduate to find it, but don\u2019t give up!\n\nI\u2019ll end with a bit of practical advice: if you don\u2019t have the best grades, figure out what went wrong and try to improve. But also, start working hard to get some externships and internships. Practical experience will help you in a number of ways. First, you\u2019ll appeal to employers because you have some training outside of doctrinal classes. Second, you\u2019ll inevitably network more if you get out into the real world. Third, you\u2019ll get a head start on learning what fields and employment types are good for you (e.g., firm, solo practice, government, non profit).

(Warning. Speaking on mental health and bullying)", "selftext": "Hello fellow Law students and Alumni. As you can tell this is a burner account and I honestly just need advice and know some people from my class are on here so would rather keep some things private from them. Before you say \u201coh boy here we go another 1L just wanting to complain about transferring and how law school sucks\u201d I want to say I love the challenge of Law School and wish there weren\u2019t such extenuating circumstances that would have driven me to even think of pursuing a transfer. Currently at a T50 school in my original home state grades still haven\u2019t been sent out so can provide no information on that. \nI want to preface this by talking a little on my background. I come from a family that has some temper and mental health problems but we all have sought help and seemed to have it under control. Mine stemmed both from biological reasoning and the severe bullying (almost to the point of abuse) I received growing up. Yes I did play sports and had my team relationship and those guys were like family, but these didn\u2019t develop until later in high school when the problems had already begun. Once I went to college out of state everything was mostly good, I developed almost a second family with my friends and to this day they are my support network because they understand what\u2019s going on almost more than my actual family did. The first issue though is they are now 1200 miles away. Along with the therapist who legitimately changed my life and got my almost bipolar/rage disorder under complete control. I did find a therapist in my home town that is in the same network so when I\u2019m home if I have a flare up I immediately know who to go to. \nSo when I moved to my current school, which is a 4+ hour drive from my hometown, I figured it would be trying to make friends in law school but definitely something I could overcome. I\u2019m initially a shyer person but open up to people and get along with others. Instead I was met with nothing but disrespect, ostracism, and blatant bullying that administration has done nothing to prevent and Damn near encouraged. I was quiet in the beginning of the year and mostly kept to myself and treated all with respect. I have no friends and people actively have avoided talking to me and won\u2019t even address or fake a conversation when I attempt to strike one up at lunch or in between classes. To make matters worse they have spoken falsely on my character to faculty which I have had to go and address and clear things up with them and I have been subject to legitimate almost grade school bullying where other students have spilled drinks on me and taken some of my possessions. All of this has just aggravated my mental health issues to the point where I\u2019ve attempted to seek help to campus services and have been told \u201cmy problems don\u2019t exist\u201d. There are no professionals in the area of the school itself so have not been able to seek outside help. When I reached out to administration I was essentially told \u201cit\u2019s not our problem to deal with handle it amongst the students unless it gets physical.\u201d  \n\nNow if you\u2019ve made it this far I would like to thank you for actually caring, there are much more details but I\u2019d rather not get too specific for privacy and brevity sake. \nAll of this is leading up to the question of with these circumstances, is it still a stupid idea to transfer law schools to one only slightly higher in the rankings but back to the area where my second family is and where I know I\u2019ll at least have my select few great friends and be moving to a better job market as well? I will be swinging for the fences on a T14 transfer as well but that heavily depends on grades. \nThank you all for your time and I hope you had a fantastic Holiday season and an even better second semester.", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/eh371m/transfer_advice_and_questions_warning_speaking_on/", "created_utc": 1577604480}, {"id": "eh3i5e", "title": "Things I can\u2019t say to my law school friends", "selftext": "So I just want to take a moment to express gratitude to those of you on here who have provided encouragement through my law school journey.

Ashley punched Jason in the face, knocking him over and fracturing his skull. Jason was hospitalised for 2 months.

It is structured in a way where there are numerous assignments throughout the semester and each is assigned its own percentage of the overall grade.\n\nI am a pretty strict record keeper and kept a spreadsheet of my own, tracking everything throughout the course. Anyways I was surprised when I did not recieve an A. Knowing mistakes can sometimes be made, I asked to see my prof to talk about the grade.\n\nWhen I met with the prof they pulled out a spreadsheet with how my grade mathematically came out (including all of the constituent parts to the overall grade). Our math did not match. I do have a list of all the grades input on Blackboard (also done by the prof - this conflicts with the spreadaheet). The prof insisted their math was correct, and allowed me to leave with the spreadsheet and to move on. Well I went and made another spreadsheet (not just looking over the old one   I made). The math showed that I came above the cutoff for and A according to what the prof indicated - it also matches the Blackboard grades. I can point to three areas where the professor\u2019s math is off, one of which is an error in my favor (though controlling for that I still would be above the cutoff as it currently exists).\n\nHere\u2019s the conundrum. If I appeal, and say this mathematical error impacts the entire class, not just me, is it possible that administration will say tough luck it\u2019s harmless error or worse yet, recompute and my grade might lower because of a revised curve?

School's \"Solution\" Is Basically To Ignore The Problem", "selftext": "My law school's dean just emailed us to say that a professor accidentally re-used an exam for a 1L first semester final that they had  administered a few years ago, and that an unknown number of students had access to the old exam before our final (through other sources, I've heard that current students got access to the old exam because last year, the professor gave it to their students to practice with, and those students passed it on the this year's students). This obviously gives those students who had access an unfair advantage.\n\nThe school's solution is to allow the students who had access to the old exam to voluntarily turn themselves in, and to be graded on their own curve. Nobody who had access will be punished (as they shouldn't be because they didn't know). This solution is terrible for two reasons: (1) obviously no students, or very few, will turn themselves in because, if they do, their scores are almost guaranteed to drop; and (2) even if everybody did turn themselves in, they're still possibly going to receive a higher score within their modified curve than they would if they had never seen the test because they had the opportunity to study those specific questions.\n\nThis is beyond unfair because this grade could be the difference between receiving a scholarship, internship, etc. I believe that a more equitable solution would be to re-administer a brand new test, and the few other students from the class that I've spoken to agree. How do you all think I should go about trying to get this done? Create a petition? Publicize the mistake somehow? This would likely reflect very poorly on the school.\n\nDo you have any other ideas about better solutions or do you have arguments that the school's solution is the best?

This has been all extremely demotivating to me. I know this is all about studying law in the U.S where you are also burdened by an awful student debt, but I personally think this applies to my country as well. Yesterday I went to the go-to website for finding jobs in my country and I sorted it out by law and one of the best offers requires you to have 3 years of practice, speak 2 foreign languages alongside of many other big requirements and offers a pay that is less than the one I'm currently getting at my part time job ( I work with a foreign to my country language that is extremely desireable here ).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI should also note that my father is a lawyer and was a big reason why  I decided to study law.

Now that I've started growing up more, however, I am not certain if I myself am cut out to study law. It seems that in order to succeed in this field - you have to work extremely hard ( like really really hard ), work non stop, be extremely sharp and sacrafice other aspects of your life.

I've been thinking how much easier my life would be if I just dropped out and switched to IT/Programming. Sure, it wouldn't be as interesting to me, but I do well with technology and the demand for those 2 fields in my country is hugeeeeeeee. I'd be able to finish my education and get a really well paying job almost instantly I believe. The thing is - I am not sure how fulfilling it'd be to me. I should also mention that I struggle with my mental health heavily. I know being a lawyer is pretty damn stressful.

To share their experiences with one another and to offer advice on how to succeed in law school, and beyond. I think our law school experiences should not be limited to just the school we attend. Students who attend lower ranked schools should be able to connect with students from the T-14 schools, and engage in in-depth analysis of case law together.\n\nThis is a platform created for law students, by law students. I have edited over a 100 videos of law students sharing their law school experience from the moment they took the LSAT,  and how they made it onto moot court, trial team, law review, and other journals. Students also share their experiences on how they balance law school with a personal life (married life), how they balance work with law school etc. Additionally, we have audio case briefs recorded by other law students.\n\nYour contribution is  needed.

Like, I don't feel like I deserve anything, and that's not what this post is about even if it's skating a fine line. However, I've basically worked my ass off a lot these past 6-7 months as a 2L staff member on my law school's law review. Like, I know for a fact I went above and beyond the average amount of time staff members typically work. Why? Partially because I'm not one to half-ass a job and partially because there were a few potential spots on the administrative board that I really wanted to do during my 3L year. I wanted to earn the respect of the current administrative board so that they might consider me for these spots. A few days ago, however, I found out that not only was I passed over for all the positions I was interested in, but I got placed in a position that I **really** did not want, and I'm being told I can expect to do 40-60 hours/week of work in this position. Now I feel trapped. I'm going to have to work so hard doing something I don't give a shit about, and now I'll see my wife even less. And to make matters worse, those chosen for executive board and the more desirable administrative board positions ended up just being the popular students (despite them promising this wouldn't happen). \n\nSo then onto my note. Again, I do not feel entitled to being published. But, being interested in pursing academia to a degree, I was really hoping to get published this year. I worked hard on my note, my note adviser kept saying it was a solid topic and well-written, and yet I just found out today that I will not be getting published. Obviously, not everyone can get published, but it was a real gut punch to me. Now I have to tell me family, who's been asking for weeks \"when will you be getting published?\" And I can't help but ask myself \"what did I do wrong?\" Like seriously, what did I do wrong? I hate how in law school you can work real hard, feel like you're doing everything right, and it could ultimately not matter. \n\nBut now I just feel like total shit and can't focus on anything.

I currently live in a house with 3 other roommates, 2 of which are law students who will be leaving over the summer to study for the bar at their respective homes, and will sublease their rooms. The idea of living with strangers (the subletters) while doing bar prep sounds unappealing, even if they work 9-5. Also, it still remains to be seen what my one non-law student housemate will do; she is a freelancer, spends lots of time at home, and is loud and inconsiderate (she and I share a bathroom and our rooms are very close to each other)\u2014so even time away from her while studying would be ideal.\n\nStaying with my family is also not ideal. Their new house is not \"home\" to me; I'd have a place to sleep, but I don't have a space I can claim for my own to study and focus; it's more of \"my parents' house.\" Also, my parents, while extremely supportive, are very \"present\" people (also freelancers!), so ultimately I think I'd be just as distracted staying with them for the summer. I should add that my parents are not well off, so having to house me for two months might be a bit of a burden of them; of course, they'd never let me go homeless, but I'm trying to be mindful of that too.\n\nThe reason for the subject line\u2014my boyfriend offered me an interesting option. He will be working in Sri Lanka for a little bit this summer starting in mid-May. It'll mostly be monsoon season, so the outdoors won't be appealing. I'd have free housing, as I'd stay with him (and his lodging is paid by his job) and cost of living is dirt-cheap. I'd have the place to myself while studying, and then during my free time I'd be with someone who does not stress me out. Is this crazy? While I have never been to SL before, I have been India, and am generally well-traveled, so I'm not worried about culture shock. It could be an opportunity to be somewhere for really cheap, and perhaps a new experience I could enjoy for a day or two before diving into bar prep. \n\nTHOUGHTS.", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/ezlukv/should_i_study_for_the_bar_in_sri_lanka/", "created_utc": 1580958802}, {"id": "ezmlx6", "title": "Questions to ask attorneys at informal meeting", "selftext": "Hello all and thanks in advance for your advice,\n\nI go to a small poorly ranked but well connected in its metro area school.

I don't really have much interest in clerking after graduation.\n\nAdditionally, I am supposed to hear back from a different federal judge by the 15th (next Saturday), where he will have made his decision. I would take either of these federal internships if I didn't get a SA, but they aren't my first choice. I would rescind my application to both judges if I had a SA offer, but I just don't have that, and I would be very scared to bank on getting a SA at one of those seven firms. I just really want to avoid offending any judge, but I still want to make sure I'm making a choice that will advance my professional development.

All of this means  that 2L is a time when we must  begin to decide what we really want out of our careers. \n\nThe initiation into Biglaw conformity can be soul destroying; years of doing grunt work, not actually meeting or counseling clients, or litigating, for decades. Yet, with hard labor and conformity,  a chance for enormous guaranteed salaries and a magnificently affluent lifestyle.\n\nBut there are so many alternatives:\n\n\nReally making a difference in the lives of actual people. Making the world a better place using the skills and knowledge that we are now learning. For example:\n\nWorking with a small firm, making far less money but being almost immediately immersed into actual practice\n\nBecoming a prosecuting attorney and fighting crime \n\nBecoming a criminal defense attorney and assuring a fair trial to people accused of crime \n\nWorking for the Public Defender and assuring  justice to the poorest of the poor.\n\nSacrificing high earnings for social justice and working in poverty or customer  law \n\nContributing to the corpus of law through appellate practice.\n\nDoing divorce law: fighting for abused women by securing reasonable child support or fighting for equitable treatment for men who are being railroaded unfairly in divorce proceedings.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with working your way up to partner in a large top notch firm. Most worthwhile things take time and great effort. \n\nBut if you're chafing at the idea of being screened (by phone!) just to get an interview, and you find your primary concern is to figure out what to say to best ingratiate yourself with the screener, it may be a good time to step back and see if a decade of obsequious subservience is too high a price for the eventual and admittedly lavish rewards.\n\nI think 2L and 3L should be a time of exploration of options, not an unthinking deep dive into the corporate ocean.

The first car that I rented, yes, there\u2019s a second one :D, was Bmw 7 series F01.

When I gave back the car, I had to wait 40 days to receive an answer from them about my 500\u20ac safety deposit. The reply was following: because you were speeding, we can\u2019t return your deposit, but we are ready to help you out, by renting you another car. \n\nI really needed another car, because I had tickets to ballet(that was my new year's gift and I loved it).

I'm also aware that people with my grades/work experience/# of bids have historically gotten the firm they've ranked first. However, it's a weird matching process where only firms/students who rank each other 1 are guaranteed. Because firms are aware of who everyone interviews with, in the past, I know a few students with my stats haven't gotten their first choice, and apparently it was b/c their top-choice firm assumed they'd want to go to the most \"prestigious\" firm on their roster as #1. \n\nAs I'm sort of considering how to rank these firms, I'm having a lot of trouble because I've sincerely liked every group of people, the structure of the program, the practice areas, etc. I have a bunch of factors I'm considering, but I'd love any input on what factors are more important than others (or which things I shouldn't really be thinking about). \n\n* **Prestige** \\- All 5 are ranked on the Global 200, as well as the top 130 of the Am Law 200. 3 of the firms are ranked on the Vault 100 (around the 30, 55, 60 marks) and more nationally based, while the other two are well-regarded in my region in particular (i.e., one's the top firm in my city for a huge range of practice areas, and the other ranks around 20)\n* **Satellite v. headquarters** \\- the 3 more nationally \"prestigious\" firms are all satellite offices (w/ around 25ish people in office), while the more regional ones are headquartered/have major offices in my city w/ 100 or 200 attorneys. \n* **Retaining 1L summer associates** \\- The two regional firms have a fairly regular practice of inviting back graduates of the program for 2L summer and then hiring them on as associates. While that's not totally off the table for the more national firms, it's much rarer (especially b/c their office size is so much smaller). \n* **Culture/people** \\- I've really liked every person that I've met through the interview process, and they all seemed to sincerely enjoy their work and their co-workers (maybe this is a trap that I've fallen for, but they all did seem really likable and that I would enjoy a summer working under them). I still have yet to interview with two, but I think my region is known for a slightly more \"laidback\" atmosphere so it's not all suits and ties everyday, which I really like -- and I can't imagine these final two places will differ in that regard. \n* **Areas/type of work** \\- the national firms all promised substantive work, and some had examples of past projects while one sort of implied that summer associate work was going to be grunt work being pawned off. Also the smaller offices of national firms will obviously have less offerings across practice areas (for example, all three don't have IP, which I may be tentatively interested but pretty open to anything), while the larger regional offices all have a huge array of practice areas. \n\nI guess I'm wondering how much weight should I give each of these considerations when I make my final ranking?

(Evening Student)", "selftext": "I'm currently a non-traditional (15 years combined military/work experience) second year evening student (2E) at a borderline T1/T2 state flagship school near a strong regional market. Our school essentially treats 2Es as 1Ls; 3Es as 2Ls; and 4Es as 3Ls. For instance, the first opportunity for evening students to compete for their 2L SA positions at the OCI following their 2E year (for the summer before their 4E year). \n\nBecause I'm using my GI Bill, but want to also keep some of it in reserve for my kids, summer classes are really efficient from \"benefits cost per credit earned perspective\"; so I took a full summer course load after my 1E year and will get a full load of externship credit from an internship at a Federal Agency this summer. This puts me 19 credits ahead of my peers. If I take the maximum recommended number of credits per semester next year (12 credits, 10 per semester is typical for an evening student), I'll be 2 credits short of graduating at the end of the spring semester, and can take 1 summer class in 2021 to knock it out. However, I likely wouldn't get my graduation certification in time to take the summer bar exam, and wouldn't have time to adequately study for it anyway. It also wouldn't allow me to take a few bar-tested courses that I'd really like to take, because of scheduling conflicts. \n\nIt also seems like it would be a bit weird if I get a SA position at OCI, because I would essentially graduate during my 2L OCI. But I suppose that's not very different from a 3L competing in OCI for an actual position, rather than a SA.  \n\nWhereas if I delay, I can choose not to take any classes over the summer, do a 2L SA after my 3E year, then return to school for one semester of 4E, graduate in December, and take the Feb Bar. There's also the question of Law Review; evening students can't petition until the end of 2E year, and they normally ask for a 2 year commitment. If i get accepted, I don't know how that would impact my plan.\n \nI'm currently working at a great (non-legal) job now; in fact, they've given me clearance to take a brief leave of absence so I can do my Federal Internship this summer (using up my accrued paid vacation time).  But unless something changes, I may have to leave my position in June 2021 no matter what I chose; which makes a nice demarcation point for trying to find a legal job. \n\nI've never been interested in Biglaw, and have enough military time built up that federal agencies are tempting, because I can buy FERS retirement credit back for my military time. But while I'm currently eligible for Fed Honors post-grad hiring, I know that's a stretch from a T1 school (and I've been cautioned about the long-term career prospects of Honors attorneys at federal agencies).  So while I certainly don't need/want the BL lifestyle (debt free and 3 kids), I'd be willing to suck it up for a few years to guarantee a Federal position (although clerking actually sounds like fun, if that's another way in). So I plan on competing at OCI, although my heart's not really in it. \n\nRight now I'm leaning towards the \"graduate in December\" option,  but I'm fully open to people thinking I'm an idiot for spending longer in school than I absolutely have to (although I actually like all of the people in our evening cohort). \n\nWhat would you do?

(1) don\u2019t cry over spilt milk. Your classes are moving online. (2) identify what exactly worked well with in-class and what the worries are about online learning.

I think this might be an underrated issue and is probably the most difficult part of transitioning to online (if you had a support system to begin with that is).

Also, I\u2019m sure there are other professors like this out there.\n\nI\u2019m a 1L and for one of my classes, there is a professor, who we as a class collectively believe is unreasonable. We don\u2019t necessarily have an issue with her/his teaching style, it\u2019s more the way she/he conducts himself and the expectations she/he has for us in and outside of class.  The issues we have are these:\n\n1. The professor often berates students in class when they\u2019re trying to answer a question she/he poses and the students pause to take a breath and the professor won\u2019t let the student finish answering her/his question. The professor then claims that they need to think about their answer more, despite the fact that they were just thinking/pausing when trying to answer her/him.\n\n2. Expects us to go to sessions outside of class. We are an evening division and the professor often picks the end of the week for extra sessions, which is not okay for a lot of my classmates as the expectation is they are to stay later at their jobs since they typically don\u2019t attend class at the end of the week and have to cut out early for class the rest of the week and their bosses want them present for the hours they\u2019re typically supposed to be at work.\n\n3.  This one is more petty than anything, but the professor\u2019s final starts at 4PM (evening classes and finals don\u2019t start until 6) and is apparently like 5 hours.\n\n4. The final issue is the writing exercises that are assigned. Overall, they\u2019re helpful. However, the expectations that the professor has in terms of what we as 1Ls would write is extremely unrealistic. For example, for our most recent assignment, the total answer packet was 50 pages long, ten of which was the original assignment packet. There were three questions and one question alone took up about 15-20 pages of explanation.  Unfortunately, it\u2019s not one of those situations where the professor is going \u201cOh, I don\u2019t expect you to write everything here, this is just what an ideal answer looks like.\u201d Nope, he/she wants us to write everything in the answer unless marked otherwise (which, out of everything, was maybe two paragraphs at the most). The other thing I will add about the answers we\u2019re given is that they go into way too much detail, more than the average 1L would think up/should be expected to know at this stage. I know it\u2019s dumb and I know that we\u2019re supposed to develop our thinking skills, but this is way beyond anything and past classes of this professor have voiced something similar.\n\n5. I was contemplating on not putting this because it might be a giveaway, but eh. We have video class recordings for each class, something the school requires to have for 1Ls. This professor, however, had the recordings removed, giving some excuse about the audio. The recordings were never reposted and we did complain to the administration about this, but nothing was done. Also, the professor refuses to put up the class slides. I\u2019m not saying we have a right to have access to the slides, but they would be nice to have to double check our notes since we\u2019re expecting to turn them in and must refine them before giving them in.\n\nAgain, I know this is stupid, but the latest thing (the writing assignment) is driving everyone nuts and we\u2019re afraid for our grades because of how much is expected of us.

A 1L who opts for grades would be going into OCI with 8 grades. (assuming your school is like mine, where legal writing is a full-year course). Clearly this is meant for people whose lives have been completely turned upside down by the coronavirus \u2014 for them, pass/fail is obviously preferable to bombing finals. And one could argue that if someone's doing ok enough where they aren't sure if they should be doing pass/fail, they're doing ok enough to still get grades. \n\nBut someone whose immediate family members become sick or unemployed and would be able to assist them in a much greater capacity with the extra time and energy that pass/fail grants him might be reluctant to take it because he fears that it will seriously hurt him in the long-term (OCI gets 2L summer jobs, which for many, if not most, students is where they work after graduation) \u2014\u00a0this is especially true for students with loans, spouses, and/or children. \n\nEven if employers say they will not hold pass/fail against students (and I'm sure they mean it), there's no guarantee that they won't subconsciously favor students who chose grades this semester. Between two students with 3.6s, one after 3 grades and one after 8 grades, it's hard to argue that the latter doesn't have an edge. And you could argue that someone who still gets grades *does deserve* an edge \u2014\u00a0which is a fair argument. There are certainly going to be students not seriously affected by coronavirus who will opt for pass/fail in order to lock in good first semester grades, or because they fear they won't do well in their current classes.\n\nBut again, students seriously affected by coronavirus, or thrust into a wildly different time-zone, or stuck in disruptive homes with poor wifi and having to share their electronic devices don't get to make this calculus.

For instance, **the university administration has refused to guarantee these 30 days of pay to subcontracted dining and catering workers at Harvard Medical School, Harvard Law School, and the Graduate School of Design,** as well as at the Science Center\u2019s Clover Cafe and the School of Education's Rebecca's Cafe.\n\nI'm posting this for more clarity, as I don't know how many people this affects, whether any HLS students are familiar with this, etc. And a little for posterity, it seems like something HLS students should be aware of. I encourage everyone to read the entire petition, it's very interesting and a sign of the times to an extent (as others on twitter have pointed out, Harvard has a 40 billion dollar endowment).", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/fmr0d7/harvard_law_students_thoughts_on_the/", "created_utc": 1584839215}, {"id": "fn22vr", "title": "If the Summer Bar is postponed will employers expect us to start working right after school?", "selftext": "There would be no need to \"study\" so would they just have kids come to work right away?", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/fn22vr/if_the_summer_bar_is_postponed_will_employers/", "created_utc": 1584893553}, {"id": "fn4ibm", "title": "How was your experience not being rich at a T14?", "selftext": "Asking as I will be enrolling next semester.

These were the following:  \n\n\n* A clear majority of students expressed a preference for an option allowing for grades;\n* The \u00a0employers who regularly recruit on our campus and participate in on-campus interviews expressed a preference for grades;\n* A majority of the Deans of other top 30 law schools who moved to mandatory Pass/Fail systems expressed a hope that all schools and employers would adopt a January On-Campus Interview process, so that current 1L students could have grades from the 2L Fall semester upon which employment decisions could be made;\n* There is no reason to believe that employers will agree with each other to wait until January to interview the candidates that they want, and there is no reason to suspect that students will wait until January to seek employment;\n* The economy is likely to take a severe downturn, making the employment market extremely difficult for all law students and recent graduates;\n* The absence of a graded option forces employers to rely upon Fall 2019 grades or law school rankings to select students, favoring students from higher-ranked schools if information from grades is not available;\n* Grades provide some assurance that the certification of competence to third parties (future clients) for which we have a moral and ethical duty is a reliable one.\n\nOf course, other members of the faculty may have reasons that are not expressed here.\"  \n*2. Will faculty reconsider the policy?*  \n\"The faculty had a thorough discussion spanning two full faculty meetings bridging four days.

Unemployment is off the charts and a lot of people are probably sitting contemplating getting another degree. Picking up a new marketable skill if you have the time and resources is an excellent thing to do right now. And law school might work out for a small contingent of people with full scholarships going to good schools. But going to law school because you think in 3 years the storm will pass and you can practice law is, generally, a bad plan.\n\nI graduated from undergrad in 2008. Finding a job during the recession was a tall order. When I matriculated into law school I met a lot of people who decided to take out massive loans and figured since jobs were scarce anyway they may as well shoot for a more lucrative career in law and wait out the storm in school. This is bad thinking for recession/depression economies because 1) the job market for attorneys is already saturated, 2) the legal market recovery from 2008 was slow, and 3) law schools didn\u2019t learn any lessons from 2008 and this new depression will probably force systemic changes that aren\u2019t conducive to new grads coming out of an already obsolete system of legal education.\n\nFirst, even after the market \u201crecovered\u201d for legal services last decade the market is still at a saturation point for attorneys. A law degree doesn\u2019t have a lot of pull in other industries. You should only go to law school with the mindset that it\u2019s a gateway to a particular trade and mostly consists of an economic barrier to entry. That economic barrier is typically north of 6 figures. There are plenty of other degrees and skills you can learn that are free or cost a fraction of the cost in terms of time, lost opportunities, and dollars. There\u2019s a lot of ways to achieve a stable financial life that are better than practicing law.\n\nSecond, the market for legal services was slow to recover after 2008 and [never really went back to the way it existed before the recession.](https://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2019/article/producer-prices-in-the-legal-services-industry-after-the-great-recession.htm) (Producer prices in the legal services industry after the Great Recession) This is partly because companies changed the way they handle their legal spend. When there\u2019s economic pressures on business large and small they react and change the way their systems work. The legal services industry is a complementary industry to those businesses and has to adapt around whatever they decide to do to stay alive. This economic calamity will probably follow a similar track of contraction in legal spend and then systemic changes that reduce the need for legal services or look for \u2018legalish\u2019 vehicles for legal advice like legalzoom.\n\nLaw schools didn\u2019t change much to reflect new legal industry realities. They have no incentive to, and the value of the education you receive is a pile of smoking hot garbage as a result. Law schools are dinosaurs, accredited by the ABA, and their only purpose is to receive money in the form of federally backed student loans so they can pay faculty and administrators absurd sums of money while most their students will struggle. As institutions, they do not give one iota of a fuck about your welfare or ability to practice or pay down your student debt. Law schools will not change until the ABA either stops accrediting them or the federal government wises up and turns off the student loan money faucet. They simply do not feel the economic conditions necessary to change in the same way businesses and practicing lawyers do. \n\nFor the majority of students it\u2019s incumbent on them to seek out mentors and practicing attorneys to teach them how to practice law or run a law firm. Most those opportunities for professional growth are about to get wiped out.\n\nThe education you receive in law school is largely inadequate to learning how to practice and that\u2019s even within the industry it\u2019s supposed to prepare you to thrive in. Law school is mostly an incredibly expensive networking event. Don\u2019t take out massive student debt and matriculate into law school without carefully considering these factors. It\u2019s not a place to avoid financial ruin. For most people it is financial ruin.", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/g17okm/do_not_try_and_ride_out_an_economic_storm_in_law/", "created_utc": 1586878391}, {"id": "g19b6a", "title": "Really need encouragement - Covid19 ruining chance at graduating on time", "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI'm just looking for some positive thoughts I guess.

And of course as any family would do when their 5-8 year old says something ridiculous, they shrugged it off. But recently I learned that someone on my moms side of the family was a lawyer, and is now in fact a judge. And I got me thinking. I could actually see myself doing that one day. Here\u2019s where the questions come, my family is not rich, they can\u2019t afford to put me through college and law school so I will have to pay all on my own. Most of my questions are about the financial situation.\n\n1. How much does law school really cost?\n2. Is the pay after law school worth it?\n3. How do I know if I will succeed?\n4. What steps can I take now to Benefit myself later (studying, classes in school, scholarships, anything)?\n\nOh, I thought I should mention as well, this is not some teenager thinking \u201coh I\u2019ll get rich being a lawyer\u201d. No I\u2019m genuinely interested in partaking in one of greatest things mankind has ever conceived, the law.\n\nKindest regards,", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/g9ek6n/hello_im_a_high_school_student_and_recently_ive/", "created_utc": 1588039818}, {"id": "g9frbb", "title": "Examplify Audio Records?", "selftext": "My school uses examplify to take our law school exams and i was just told by another student that they the program records audio and visuals of the test taker.
