If you persist, if you keep on resisting sin for just a few months, then you can *feel* the Holy Spirit inside your body (yes, literally) and everything will be fine and much better and all depression will vanish and you will feel great happiness. Study God's promises to each and every human soul. Repeatedly call upon the holy Name of Jesus Christ to aid you, which, according to the Church's teaching, holds *intrinsic* power. \"Hallowed be thy Name...\" Pray and meditate. \n\nThere is a God, Lord of All, residing in the *heart*, who cares about everyone regardless of demographics (Romans 10:12). \n\nTurn away from your sin (Galatians 5:21).\n\nFind out who your real enemy is (Ephesians 6:12). \n\nHave faith in *justification* by the Christ.  \n\nSalve Regina ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\\_uj8h4SCsnE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uj8h4SCsnE)).", "title": "Mental Health at UIUC"}, {"created_utc": 1575432041, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/e5tgly/around_when_do_the_spring_2020_housing_contract/", "id": "e5tgly", "is_self": true, "score": 1, "selftext": "I feel like its been ages since I submitted it", "title": "Around when do the Spring 2020 Housing Contract Assignments Come Out?"}, {"created_utc": 1575433477, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/e5tqw8/lost_airpods_case_near_illini_tower/", "id": "e5tqw8", "is_self": true, "score": 1, "selftext": "I accidentally dropped my airpods case on the sidewalk between 5th and Daniels and 5th and Chalmers.

Why would a psychiatrist chose to work here when they would be paid public service rates, live surrounded by cornfields, and have to service a population who by and largely would be unwilling to leave the situation that is causing them such discomfort (college) while at the same time working for said environment. As such, people need to step back a bit and find other solutions as this situation is likely not changing anytime soon.", "title": "On the UIUC Mental Health Crisis"}, {"created_utc": 1575650760, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/e716cj/alternate_spring_break/", "id": "e716cj", "is_self": true, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hi!\n\nHas anyone gone on UIUC's Alternative Spring Break?

UIUC has garbage college culture, especially for being a massive school in the Big 10. This isn't the fault of any specific person, but the people as a whole who attend. UIUC has a culture synonymous with hard working, incredibly intelligent people. People who are complaining about their mental health, are the ones who make this school so unappealing to athletes. Nobody goes to the basketball games, the football stadium is considered packed when it's only 2/3rds full, Bama sells out every single game for the past 6 years, we have no mascot or symbol to rally around, our chants stink, we have crappy parties after every frat got popped, and frankly tuition is way to messed up. UIUC has the closest culture to an Ivy league university next too Duke, Purdue, and Stanford. We're the cause of the depression epidemic, people really are staying in the study for econ 202 rather than supporting the basketball team with their friends and engaging in the campus lifestyle. All the Uni can do is provide resources or activities for people, honestly people who are self diagnosed and just can't take the hit to their ego that they're a B- to D+ student. Clinical depression is a serious problem that nobody wants to talk about, and getting resources on campus can only help. BUT, if your depression is rooted in the fact you're so stressed because you don't want a 75% on a random 4 point clicker quiz, or you just don't feel like supporting your fellow classmates; that is on you.

As tempting as transferring to a school back home is, I am aware that one semester may not be enough to base this decision on. Academically, I have loved this university so far (I should finish this semester with a 4.0 depending on finals). The reasons I want to transfer back to New England are its geography, my family and friends being there, and my biggest hobbies not being accessible in IL (snowboarding, hiking, beaches, etc.). I don't have any close friends here and rarely go out, so that also contributes to wanting to go back to my home-state, as well as the cost of out-of-state tuition. I joined a few RSOs at the start of the semester but none panned out because of my schedule and a major change.

Due to the weather last night, many stores were closing early, including mine. I left for my bus stop around 8:00\u2014 like many freshman here, I don\u2019t have a car. The bus is my only method of transportation. Again, due to the weather, some buses were not running or were 45 minutes to an hour off schedule. \n\nI was stranded. There were no cars in the parking lot that were anywhere close to me. There was no bus coming. Anyone I could call to pick me up was at best 20 minutes away. I called my boyfriend (we are long distance) just because I wanted his opinion on what to do. Wait who knows how long for the bus? Call a friend and risk them getting in an accident in the conditions? Walk? \n\nIt was around this time that a man in a dinky, old, white SUV pulled up next to me and my bus stop on the edge of the parking lot. He came out of no where, or maybe I wasn\u2019t paying close enough attention. Either way, he was there, and nobody else was. #Exposed am I right? I was talking to my boyfriend through my headphones, so I guess the man didn\u2019t realize I was on the phone at all. \n\nHe asked me if I needed a ride. I told him no. He asked again. I told him no. \nHe scooted towards the passenger door. Told me that I could trust him. It was cold, and I was too pretty to be in the cold.\nI told him no, I told him goodbye. He persisted.\nThis man was close enough to me that my boyfriend heard every end of the situation. He heard how the man persisted, calling me gorgeous\u2014 \u201cyou are so blessed to be that gorgeous. You really are something, sweetheart.\u201d He was still getting closer to the door, and I still had no where to go. He asked my name. I told him a fake one. He continued to persist, ignoring my rejections. \n\u201cI would love to have someone as gorgeous as you in my car. You really are something.\u201d \nHe was too close to the passenger door now; I didn\u2019t know what to do. I could\u2019ve tried to run, however there was snow and ice on the ground and I wasn\u2019t in snow shoes. He was bigger and probably stronger than me. Probably faster too. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t find out. \n\nIt was at this time, a couple of women from across the parking lot began to approach me. When they were about halfway across the lot, I heard them yell \u201cMa\u2019am? Are you okay?\u201d I looked at them and shook my head no as the man continued to try to coerce me into his car. When they got a little closer, I told the man \u201cmy friends are here for me now.\u201d He SPED away. \n\nThe two women were very kind, and offered me help and a ride home, telling me how they knew something wasn\u2019t right, and how they witnessed a lot of the situation from across the lot. I did not take their offer on a ride home. Most sex trafficking services work like that; just when you think someone is there to help you, they really are in on the scheme. Even though they seemed nice and genuine, you can\u2019t be too careful. \n\nEventually, a coworker who had been waiting for her ride on the other side of the mall spotted me and took me home. Had the two women and my coworker had not have been there, I don\u2019t know how my situation would have ended. \n\nI\u2019m sorry this is long, but stuff like this is so important. We HAVE to be smart guys. If you see something that you think looks wrong DO something. You could save someone like me from an unnecessary and dynamically dangerous situation.  \n\nHappy Holidays, and God Bless!!", "title": "Please be so safe this holiday season: I was almost abducted"}, {"created_utc": 1576518660, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/ebih24/failed_class_at_the_last_second/", "id": "ebih24", "is_self": true, "score": 1, "selftext": "So I've messed up and due to my mental health and lack of motivation I missed a paper that is necessary to pass the class.

This is going to be a very long read, but I am in need of desperate advice. If you take time out of your day to read this, I want to thank you and let you know it means the world to me.\n\nI'm currently a first semester sophomore in DGS and I feel like I've done college wrong. My parents are immigrants and work for very meager hourly wages and they never even finished high school in their home country. Everything that my parents have worked for and sacrificed for me, I feel I threw down the drain. Why? I don't know. I worked so hard in high school. I had above a 4.0 weighted GPA , did sports, National Honor society, Illinois State Scholar, received the college board recognition for hispanic students award, was an Illinois State Scholar, volunteered, mathletes, and took like 8-9 AP courses receiving 4's and 5's on most exams. Given that I am a low-income hispanic male student with decent grades and involvement, I was set to do great things at least in comparison to others from my community. The world was my oyster. And then when it came to apply to university, I applied to UIUC DGS first choice completely ignorant of the stigma around it...If I'm frankly honest, I really didn't know what I wanted to major in and I had a friend going to UChicago undeclared, so I sort of assumed I could come in undeclared as well and figure it out later. But very quickly, I realized what DGS was on this campus. I quickly realized that DGS makes it nearly impossible to transfer to, forgive me please, anything but a \"bad\" major. I didn't apply to DGS because I didn't have the grades. I simply did not put much thought into what I wanted to study. If I could go back in time, I would have selected engineering undeclared. Back then, I didn't even know that was an option. I'm so stupid.\n\nWas it so wrong to be 18 and now know what I wanted to do with my life? \n\nBoth my parents do not have careers, so I didn't really have examples to look up to or anything. Not that it matters, but it would've helped receiving some sort of guidance from someone. Now I feel as if I'm lacking guidance again since DGS advisors aren't very helpful at telling you which courses to take for a major and my parents are a dead end. Not that it's anyone's fault, but it makes it very difficult to stay on track since many courses have pre-reqs. I've learned to be my own advocate and have gotten better at doing that research on my own and speaking to different advisors. Ultimately, now I feel like I am a nobody on campus. I've missed the initial enclave forming period w/ others in a similar major since I didn't have a major! I feel as if I'm on auto-pilot, here but never seen, and worthless. It's my sophomore year and all my friends are already taking leadership positions in major-related RSOs, have internships, and other research experience. I feel like I am being left behind. How am I supposed to do all that when I don't have a major? I'm trying to stay positive and not think too much about the past, but I think I really messed up big time. I don't think I would have ever majored in engineering, but I didn't even give myself the chance to apply. I've been struggling through taking courses and not knowing if I want to even major in that, and then the course affecting my GPA. It's even harder to find the motivation to study for a course if you're not even certain about the major. Maybe it's my own indecisiveness that led me down this road. \n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm tired of feeling this way. Luckily I've kept up with math courses, finished up the calculus sequence, and math has always been my strongest subject, so my plan is to transfer into mathematics next semester. It's taken me a little longer, but I've developed a passion for math and now know it is what I want to study. It's not like I'm trying to transfer into engineering, but meeting grade requirements even within LAS is tricky. I was smart in high school, but sometimes I feel like that isn't enough for what the university requires of me to transfer into a major.\n\nI'm not trying to pity myself. I own up to the mistake I made, but it's so hard to not beat myself up over it every day. I'm trying to keep working at it and hopefully transfer into math next semester. I came in with a shit ton of AP credits so that helped a lot in giving me leeway for my mistake. Can anyone offer me some sort of advice? Or some motivation I guess? Has anyone gone through a similar situation or perhaps wants to share some DGS success stories? Cause right now it seems like I ruined everything. \n\nI come from nothing. My family is extremely poor.

I\u2019ve seen posts about this before in the sub, but wanted to clarify what\u2019s actually happening so that others don\u2019t fall into this trap, and understand how to get out if they have. \n\nThe people you see are NOT WORKING FOR AMEREN. In Illinois, energy is deregulated, meaning that while you have one electric DELIVERY company (probably Ameren), you have a separate electric SUPPLY company. These both show up on your monthly Ameren bill. These electric suppliers can charge you a wide variety of rates for your electric supply. Go to [Plug In Illinois](pluginillinois.org) and you\u2019ll be able to find a huge list of energy suppliers and their rates under Compare Offers Now. \n\nThe door-to-door douchebags who came to my house represent Nordic Energy. What they do is offer an energy SUPPLY rate that is a few hundredths of a penny less than Ameren\u2019s SUPPLY rate, so they can technically save you money. The catch is that that rate expires after three months and they jack up the rate\u2014to 5 cents MORE per kilowatt hour than Ameren (at least at the current rates). \n\nSo, while your bill still comes from Ameren, and your energy DELIVERY company is Ameren, your energy supplier is someone else. This is how they get away with it\u2014you keep getting your bill with Ameren at the top, and you don\u2019t scroll down to see that \u201cNordic Energy\u201d is charging you out the asshole now that your three-month special rate (which realistically barely saved you anything)  has expired. \n\nYou can change your energy supplier with no disruption in service. Your Ameren bill should say on the bottom of the kilowatt hour breakdown who your supplier is: you can cancel with them, sign up with a new company based on your INFORMED decision on Plug In Illinois, and never lose your electricity. Ameren is just notified that they should begin billing with a new supplier on your next cycle. \n\nShoutout to Christianne at Ameren customer service who explained this all to me.", "title": "\u201cAmeren\u201d scammers explained"}, {"created_utc": 1576702922, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/ecikr7/transferring_into_gies/", "id": "ecikr7", "is_self": true, "score": 1, "selftext": "Someone told me Gies only takes 80 transfer students per major.

Some of you might get your final grades and freak out, or find out in another few weeks or month, that you're either on probation or are getting dropped from the university altogether. \n\nDon't freak out. Please. It's not the end of the world, I promise. Being on probation doesn't mean a guaranteed drop. It's really an opportunity to re-assess your wellbeing and academic habits, and see if you need to change something or get help, or maybe lighten your workload. There are SO many resources on campus, academic and otherwise, so don't be afraid to reach out to someone if you're having a tough time. It's easier to fix things now than wait for them to get worse when it's super busy and hectic in the middle of next semester.\n\nFor those of you who do get dropped, it's also not the end of the world. There are so many success stories of people who take time off and return to the university or who appeal their drops or who find some way to complete their education or career goals, regardless. I understand how stressful and catastrophic things may seem, but you are still capable of improving the situation and getting things back on track. Even if it doesn't seem like it, don't forget that we all love you. Your family, your friends, we all care about you. It'll be okay, and it's definitely not worth harming yourself over.\n\nI personally was dropped from the university after a rough few years with my mental health, and many trips to the hospital and ER, etc. I felt like I had no other options at that point, but I was very wrong, and I'm glad I pushed through. I ended up taking an almost two-year medical withdrawal to focus on my health and applied for reentry to Engineering earlier this summer and was re-accepted. I was very nervous about my first semester back, especially because I still have my probation and reentry requirements. I put a lot of effort into both my health and academics this year, and took better care of myself, and am happy to say that I'll be meeting my GPA requirement this semester. I'm also feeling way better than I've ever felt in my whole life, and am so glad I took the time off because I'm doing so much better emotionally, mentally, socially, really in every other way. I'm currently on track to graduate in 2021 and I'm so glad I'm alive. \n\nSo please, don't freak out. If you need someone to talk to about probation, getting dropped, medical withdrawals/reentry, therapy, school, whatever, feel free to DM me. :) But please, remember, nothing is every worth ending your life or hurting yourself over. \n\nDon't be afraid to ask for help! \n\nHere are some resources: \n\n**National Suicide Hotline: 1-800-273-8255**   \nUIPD: (217) 333-1216 but for an emergency, please just call **911**  \nOffice of the Dean of Students: (217) 333-0050   \nCounseling Center: (217) 333-3704  \nDRES: (217) 333-1970", "title": "If you're worried about probation or getting dropped"}, {"created_utc": 1576792419, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/ed042v/anyone_know_where_to_get_fresh_duck/", "id": "ed042v", "is_self": true, "score": 1, "selftext": "Looking to make duck for Christmas; I know that Shnucks and a few other grocers have them frozen, but I was really hoping to get a fresh one.

This was not true at all. All I had done was tell him where to get the dab cart from and I sent him the snap of this frat dude who sold em (my \u201cfriend\u201d also knew the frat dude that\u2019s why he ratted me out instead of frat dude). Fast forward to my wonderful meeting with the dean Rob Wilcyzki a few weeks later (don\u2019t care enough to correctly spell his name), he sends me an email saying I\u2019ve been found guilty of violating Student Code 1-305.e. This code says talks about distributing, making/manufacturing drugs on uiuc campus- I had just given my \u201cfriend\u201d the frat dude\u2019s contact to get it himself. I even told Wilcynzki this but he still ended up putting me on Conduct probation and giving me a University Censure. \n\nI just want to know if anyone has any type of experience or familiarity with this type of situation. The appeal time has long passed (only up to a week after being charged, this was last year), but is there any way I can argue that this isn\u2019t even a violation of that section of the student code?? I spoke with an advisor after about the entire situation and he literally said \u201cI honestly don\u2019t know why u got conduct probation because u just told your \u201cfriend\u201d where to get it from, it\u2019s like if someone asked you for alcohol, you point them to the liquor store down the street\u201d. This analogy that he gave me is the entire reason why I want to see if I\u2019d be able to appeal because 1) I didn\u2019t directly participate in distributing or making these drugs and 2) Wilcyznki charging me with conduct probation and university censure definitely seems extreme since this is the same consequence given out to people who ACTUALLY trap drugs. \n\nThis happened to me last year when I was a freshman and now I\u2019m actually realized how fucked of a situation I\u2019m in because of this extreme consequence for a not-so-extreme offense. I\u2019ve emailed Wilcyznki repeatedly asking to see my disciplinary file so I can see the exact reason and statement for why I was charged with conduct probation so that In the future I know what to say to future interviewers and on applications. But nothing from him. I literally don\u2019t even know what it says on my file for my disciplinary charge, so how am I supposed to explain it in the future to others??? \n\n\nIf anyone has any info on what I could do to appeal, or even how I could exactly see my offense in my file, or something about reaching Dean Wilzcynzki, id extremely appreciate it.

I had multiple issues going on and even tried to petition a drop for the class I got an F in but that didn't go through. This sem started off much better but somewhere in between, I started seeing similarities from last sem. I also got infected with some virus which kept me bedridden for 10 days, miss multiple deadlines and exams. Although I was moderately happy with the compensation I got, I found out at the end that I needed a high A on all five of my finals to even get C's and B's in the courses. I sorted my shit out and started late night study sessions in Grainger and I managed to get A's in both the exams that have come out yet. Although the results aren't out yet, I highly doubt I'll be able to meet the requirement and might get a 1.7 or 1.8 this sem too. Now, I'm an international and from what I've heard, they do give a lot of us an extra semester. One of my friends in the same situation has already spoken to his advisor and she has assured him that they won't drop him but my advisor hasn't given any type of assurance at all. My cumulative will be a 2.4ish still and I can even transfer into the major of my choice by just retaking a course and getting a B in it(which I know I will because I honestly won't take my education for granted going forward from here).

Boy was I wrong. From the get go, the professor and his staff disappeared after the first week, leaving many of our pressing questions unanswered. Quizzes were a mess, covering material mentioned nowhere in the textbook. We complained about this to no avail, only a short response from the professor stating it would be \"rectified\". No change.\n\nThen, three weeks in, our grades stopped being entered. Literally nothing. I didn't think this was a big deal at first, but nothing was entered in Moodle even last week. The prof did reach out and say one of the TAs was experiencing health issues and had to step down (hope they are okay), but I still find it hard to believe they fell five weeks behind on grades missing just one TA. You'd think there would be at least some gradual progress. Even so, I was sitting with a very high A before the final (based on the first three weeks).\n\nThe online final wasn't so bad, a little tougher than I imagined but still was very confident on my way out. Was expecting either an A or a high B for the class.\n\nTonight I checked my final grades and was extremely surprised to find I received a C. Now, I am not one of those people who freak out about Cs or even GPA for that matter, but I do work very hard and have a maintained a fairly high GPA. I question how I managed to fall so far, especially considering how well I started the course. It got easier as the 8-weeks progressed, and the final went well.\n\nSo I go to check the rest of the course grades only to see the Moodle website no longer exists. Zilch. Can't see any of the class grades. For all I know, the staff decided to just not grade the remainder of the class and attempted to cover it up by removing the website. Has anyone ever requested a final printout of your grades from a professor? Gotten final grade changed after they were posted? I am 95% certain I did significantly better than a C in this \"course\". I feel quite cheated and aggravated, have nothing but negatives to share about this class.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL:DR: Don't take this class, it's run horribly.

I was devastated and didnt know what i was going to do. I barely ate for the first week or so of winter break and didnt leave my bed unless forced to.

I chose that because I took an intro course a while earlier and liked it a lot and did well in it.  Also I still could graduate on time with the credits from my old major.\n\nA year later, as a senior, I got my first set of straight A's since my junior year of high school. My GPA is finally high enough to where I feel comfortable adding it to my resume and I've never been happier with my studies.\n\nTo everyone currently on or going through academic probation or suffering from imposter syndrome: I promise you it gets better.

I did everything 'right', went to class, did my homework, tried to do practice tests, but I could never get a handle on my work. The more I tried to catch up, it felt like I just would fall farther behind. I ended the semester with a 1.95, the lowest GPA I have ever had. I literally broke my phone by throwing it at the dishwasher. \n\n\nI'm now a fifth year senior, writing from my study abroad program, finally over 3.0. So what changed? A bunch actually. I Changed my program.  I came in determined to do physics, and now I'm a double major in Psychology and Italian. Even if the work wasn't necessarily easier, I did enjoy it more. I was terrified of practice tests before switching. But they became less intimidating once I was in a major I enjoyed. \n\n\nI got my anxiety treated. I go to counciling weekly and love my groups. It feels nice not being alone and hearing from other people in a similar situation. It's often nice to have a reality check and challenge my harsh self thoughts.

I did well in high school with a full IB/AP load. Graduated from UIUC at with a GPA of about 3.65 (3.75 before senioritis kicked in lol). Never thought for a sec I had a disability. While on paper I had talent and grades, I realize that a lot of problems were getting covered up by a 12-14 hour course load over my 4 years. I would read 1-3 pages of texts or papers and realize I couldn't remember a single thing I read. Assignments and learning new material always seemed to just take *longer* for me than it did for everyone else. And, something I can't really verbalize, but I knew I was kinda weird or different (later understood as me being non-neurotypical).\n\nBut hey, I graduated. It should be cool right? Then I dropped out of my PhD program after a year. And I couldn't get a career started, across multiple fields and many years. I even completed a journalism master's and realized that every single story I did left me emotionally exhausted, without understanding why. Went to the seeming extreme of joining the Army to get those folks to help me unfuck myself (technical term) and whatever character defects I had.\n\nArmy career goes seemingly well, but the cracks start to appear and my marriage goes on the rocks.

I studied a crazy amount, but for the first time in my life, it was efficient.\n\nAnd then I bear-mauled the curves (sorry, not sorry) and walked away with an A+. I'm now getting ready to challenge the MCAT.\n\nBottom line - it is possible to do well in school and have an untreated learning disability until the difficulty level ramps up to the point where your coping mechanisms aren't enough.

I plan to return to work full time after maternity leave.\n\nWe\u2019re planning to have a second and third child relatively quickly over the next few years and we don\u2019t have time to take a break from that due to my age, so things aren\u2019t necessarily going to get \u201cbetter\u201d in the next few years. \n\nI'm also applying to GT's OMSCS program and they published this article.

Alternatively, it costs $10,200 to live in a $600/mo apartment and spend $250 on groceries (which is actually pretty high) each month for 12 months. At the cheapest, you could go all the way to living somewhere for around $250/mo and spending around $80/mo on food which puts you just under $4000 for the year so financially, it makes the most sense for you to live in an apartment. \n\nPersonally: You get your own bedroom. You can go in there and cry about finals without your roommates knowing (depending on how loud you cry), you have more space to put all your stuff, you can have special guests over without having to kick your roommates out or worry about them walking in. You only share a bathroom with 0-2 people, you don\u2019t have to wear shoes in the shower, and you can collectively decide to not leave hair in the drain. Also, you probably won\u2019t have drain flies and/or cockroaches hanging out in the bathroom with you. You also can cook and eat whenever is convenient for you and you have all the appliances necessary to do so. \n\nSocially: Again you can have your special guest over and give yourselves a little bit of privacy. You can also finally host things. Have your friends over to sit on an actual couch and play smash bro\u2019s and mario kart. Host a pregame or a party. Have your study group come over to your place instead of the overcrowded libraries. Don\u2019t worry about constantly hiding certain substances because an RA could stop by at any moment. \n\nI have a lot of friends that stayed in the dorms their sophomore year and by November they were dying to get out. You may not mind living there right now but I can almost guarantee you don\u2019t want to live there for an extra year and a half. You can still sign leases for apartments through spring semester and through the summer so it\u2019s not too late. If all your friends are staying in the dorms, you might want to stay with them, but better yet you could try to convince them to move into a place with you. \nIf you don\u2019t fancy yourself a cook, you can spend around $20 a day eating out during the time you\u2019re in school and breakeven with how much the meal plan would\u2019ve cost you. The dorms are a great place to socialize and find friends as a freshman, but as a sophomore, you probably don\u2019t want to be hanging out with kids fresh out of high school. The only reason I can think to stay in the dorms after your freshman yea,r is if they have a resource like the free music lessons or the ceramics room (both in Allen) that you\u2019ve really grown attached to. Anyone that\u2019s had a positive experience staying in the dorms a second year, feel free to go off in the comments but I genuinely think apartment living is a way better and smarter way to live and I don\u2019t want people to get locked into a contract for another year and regret it because they didn\u2019t think very much about their decision.\n\nTips for apartment hunting: Go to each rental company\u2019s page and look at the buildings they own. Some of your options are JSM, University Group, CPM, Roland Realty, Ramshaw Real Estate, Bankier,  Green Street Realty, Professional Property Management. Those are the ones I know off the top of my head. Some of them have bad reputations but I\u2019ll leave it to you to look into that. Zillow and similar sites are a decent tool too but sometimes they\u2019re a little hard to follow.

But, I\u2019ve decided I\u2019m tired of living like this and today is the day I am going to figure it out, but I just don\u2019t know where to start. \n\nMy biggest fear is that I have been kicked out of the University. I never wanted it to come this far and this will always be the worst experience of my life. Depression and anxiety suck. I really want to be able to tell the school about my situation and hope they can help me because I really want to be done with this chapter of my life. \n\nI feel so lost, can someone please advise me on what to do or where to go.

With you all returning to campus and class, we wanted to give you some info on the new marijuana law to avoid any misunderstandings. You don't want to get busted, and we truthfully don't want to bust you. We don't like doing paperwork.\n\nThe big thing to remember is that federal prohibitions on marijuana remain in effect for all federally-funded colleges and universities. That means all forms of marijuana remain illegal on campus property. Additionally, the use of all forms of marijuana on university property violate the [Smoke- and Tobacco-Free Campus policy](https://cam.illinois.edu/policies/fo-64/).\n\nCampus property includes all property owned, leased, occupied, operated or controlled by the university \u2013 including classrooms, residence halls, libraries, outdoor spaces, sidewalks, and university-owned roads, among many other examples. Since it can sometimes be difficult to know where campus property begins and ends, there's a handy map available at [tobaccofree.illinois.edu](http://tobaccofree.illinois.edu/). \n\nThere are other rules to be aware of when you are off-campus, and those are listed below. **Remember, these rules apply off campus only, as possession or use of marijuana is strictly prohibited on university property**:\n\n* Marijuana can be possessed only by people 21 or older.\n* While in a vehicle, marijuana must be sealed in an odor-proof, child resistant container. Violating this statute can result in the driver being arrested for a misdemeanor.\n* Marijuana may only be sold by licensed businesses.\n* The maximum a person can possess at one time is 30 grams of cannabis flower or 5 grams of concentrate. Cannabis-infused products may contain up to 500 milligrams of THC.\n* Use is prohibited in any public place (like streets and sidewalks), in any motor vehicle, on school grounds, near someone under the age of 21, or in any place where smoking is prohibited. You may smoke or ingest cannabis in your own private residence, provided that residence is not on university property.\n\nIt is also important to note that the [U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services has previously issued guidance](https://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/policymanual/updates/20190419-ControlledSubstanceViolations.pdf) that violations of federal law involving marijuana could affect a student\u2019s immigration status or the naturalization process, even in cases where those actions do not violate state law.\n\nThe University of Illinois Police Department does not enforce immigration law, and UIPD officers will never ask about a person\u2019s immigration or citizenship status \u2013 nonetheless, it is important for students who are not U.S. citizens to understand the implications that possession or use of marijuana could have on their immigration status, visa applications, or their ability to enter the United States.\n\nHope that helps!

Even if you do poorly on everything you turn in, if you turn in everything, you can still pass! If you do really well on a few things, but skip the majority of it, you can easily fail. Student seem to underestimate how much low point value assignments can add up, and failing to do a lot of these can tank your grade at the end of the semester. This isn't to say that you should half-ass everything to get by :), and you should definitely at least try to do the assignments as instructed, but doing something will always be better than doing nothing. If you are struggling with content, time management, or mental/physical health issues, don't hesitate to seek out help from campus resources to improve in the long term, but in the short term, try to turn in as much as you can, even if it's not the quality you would like.

Over the course of the semester, members work on projects in groups led by a project manager. They work on all types of projects, from making a simple game to creating a VR framework. No experience is required to join, and you especially don\u2019t have to be a CS major. Projects are simulated like real world projects, with workflow boards, code review, and such all to prepare members for agile development and the real world. It is good way to build your experience and resume, preparing for internships and adding unique and interesting projects to talk about. Also, our members have opportunities to work on projects with companies on campus.\n\nLast semester, we had 7 groups working on projects spanning from ML App Development all the way to Data Visualization and Mechanical Devices. People with no prior experience eventually got to the point where they could teach others.\n\nWe are firm believers in project based learning. Learning through trial and something you\u2019re passionate about has been found to be a very effective technique. So, we wanted to create an environment where students can work with other interested programmers on projects that they want to work on. \n\nAlongside the projects, we also have happy hours and social events, helping members to meet people of similar interests outside of project groups. Also, since every programmer hates the idea of preparing for coding interviews and tests, we are trying to make that more fun and are planning a group-based tournament where teams work together to solve example problems from coding interviews.\n\nIf any of this sounds interesting, stop by our booth at the Recruitment Fair on Thursday, or come to one of our Info Sessions: **Thursday Jan 23 7PM Siebel 1109, Wednesday Jan 29 7PM Siebel 1109.**", "title": "Social and Inclusive Project Based CS RSO"}, {"created_utc": 1579698702, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/esbq92/project_managers_wanted_link_to_application_inside/", "id": "esbq92", "is_self": true, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hello,\n\nWe are a CS Project Based RSO and we are looking for Project Managers for the upcoming semester!

The position will mirror how a professional PM works and will provide that real world experience. Alongside the experience, the projects are funded, so they will have access to a pool of funds to assist their projects. Apply here: tinyurl.com/ProjectCodeManager\n\nThe responsibilities are as follows:\n\n1. Devise and Structure a plan for the semester - \u00a0includes timeline and deadline as well as a initial project idea\n2. Create and plan communication means and weekly meetings - Set up workflow boards and means of communication in both meetings and over online messaging\n3. Assist/Guide group members - Organize and lead group members in the right direction for the questions that they are asked about coding or generally\n4. Arrange Funding (if need be) - If the group needs funding, it is their job to decide how much and to where the funding should go\n5. Communicate with Executive Board - It will be their task to discuss progress/anything related to the group with the executive board, relaying that information so that everyone is knowledgable of the situation\n6. Around 1-4 hours a week expected\n\nWe also have some recommended qualifications:\n\n1. Some Knowledge of Coding - You don't need to know much, but enough to guide programmers in the right direction and take the head on some sort of Project\n2.

It comes furnished and we are asking $700 OBO for monthly rent or $1750 for the entire summer. Due to the move date being mid-May for the potential subleasee, we find it the most fair to only ask for $350 for the month of May, and two payments of $700 for June and July. That includes all utilities, except electricity. The electricity bill has never cost us more than $25 a month, even in our largest usage months.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBenefits:\n\n\\- Including our apartment, there are only eight 1BR/studio apartments in the building. We are located on the second floor; there is no floor above us and the first floor is only shops. This means that the apartment is very quiet; we rarely, if ever, hear our neighbors.\n\n\\- Our apartment is centrally located and only an 8 minute walk from the Quad.\n\n\\- Electricity is the only utility. Our bill is about $25/mo.\n\n\\- Completely furnished, and we will provide some additional odds and ends for the apartment. This may include a shower curtain, plunger, toilet paper, and paper towels.\n\n\\- Spacious storage and a LARGE closet. The closet could easily fit at least 3 bikes, or one young Harry Potter. Your choice! We mostly filled it with boxes. It has move able shelves, and could be used to store all other items you might need.\n\n\\- Wood floors! These are super easy to clean.\n\n\\- The unit has many large windows and good airflow. We never have issues with air conditioning or heating.\n\n\\- As stated, we are located above Cafe Paradiso, and within a block of three other coffee shops (Espresso Royale, Caffe Bene, and Starbucks). We are also a 1/2 block away from several restaurants, including Jimmy John's, Rosati's, Subway, KoFusion, and Merry Ann's. The Krannert Center, Canopy Club, and a convenience store are additionally within a 5 minute walk. Plenty of entertainment, food, and coffee shops nearby!\n\n\\- Microwave! You'd be surprised by how many apartments don't initially include this. We also have a full kitchen, with lots of storage.\n\n\\- Very close to multiple bus lines going everywhere in the Champaign-Urbana area.\n\n\\- Internet ready! You can get a modem and set up wifi yourself if you wish. (Or you can mooch off Cafe Paradiso's wifi signal. Seriously, we used it for a couple weeks until we got our own set up. I'll give you the wifi password. The speed is great and it's actually faster than our own sometimes. But, for safety reasons, you can get your own. Our xfinity bill is only $40 a month, and we never have problems with them. Don't let them talk you into a installer, it's literally as easy as plugging in a wire).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe will also include a multitude of photos (imgur link) and can provide any proof and details (exact dates, exact address, payment, schedule a meeting in person, or anything else) not otherwise stated here.

I know the rules say no throwaways, but Mods, hear me out. I'm posting on a throwaway so I don't lose my job. But I think this is important for everyone to read. I have been loyally employed to University Housing since my Sophomore year of college, and every single semester, they find a new way to piss me off. But this semester, they really went above and beyond. I'm writing this, not only because I'm pissed off, but because I feel as though the other students of this University should know what is going on in the background. Because they're not just wasting my money, they're wasting yours too. So let's begin with last Friday. \n\nLast Friday, all of the RA's and MA's were required to come back a full day earlier from our Winter Break so that we could attend a \"training\" on anti-Semitism. For those of you who don't remember, last semester there was a major controversy in which an MA made a presentation that was horribly misconstrued as anti-Semitic, and for some reason, Robert J. Jones, our Lord and Savior, decided he needed to take action on this matter which he was incredibly misinformed about. So he hired two presenters from the Jewish United Fund of Metropolitan Chicago to come speak to us. However, had he taken the time to vet his sources, or at least perform a very simple Google search, he would know that this particular group has in the past few years been at the center of some major protests, mostly by other Jewish people who are not in support of the JUF's tendency to donate and fund anti-Islam and anti-Arabic hate groups. In fact, if our illustrious leader, Chancellor Robert J. Jones takes some time away from his busy schedule of writing massmails to read this, I've found a link right [here, found from said simple Google search.](https://chicagomonitor.com/2017/03/chicago-jewish-activists-tell-jewish-united-fund-stop-funding-anti-muslim-hate-groups/) Why did Jones hire someone that so obviously goes against the message of tolerance, acceptance, and social justice that we strive to promote? My guess would be laziness. \n\nThe presenters came and gave less of a training, and more of a biased lecture, in which we were certainly educated on the problem of anti-Semitism, but we were also bombarded with definitions and explanations that were so obviously biased, it was ridiculous. Any students with dissenting opinions were silenced and ignored. When asked about Palestinian's culture and beliefs, specifically regarding self-determination, the presenters appropriately stated that they were not of that culture, and had no authority to speak on it. But though he should, I doubt our fearless leader, Chancellor Jones is going to call in anyone to represent the students of Palestinian identity. So I guess to him, they just don't matter. Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong, Jonesy. I'm just stating how it looks. \n\nThen comes Saturday. Normally, this day of training would be reserved for in-hall time, in which we would be able to work with our staff on building-specific topics and have time to work on our bulletin boards and floor decorations. Instead, Housing decided that this semester, they would revoke our usual in-hall time and replace it with a 7 hour training, in which we sat in the same room of the SDRP, in the same seats, while listening to the same two people give us a lecture on self care from 9am to 4:30pm. They wasted 2 of those hours talking about the exact same social-identity spiel that I've heard at least 3 times per semester, every semester. Towards the end of the training, one of the presenters talked about how she understood that our jobs are hard, and being an RA is difficult, and stressful. And that she knows that we don't get paid enough for what we do, we don't get compensated enough for the time and effort we put into this job. This was met with thunderous applause from all of the RA's and MA's in the room, only for it to fall flat when the same presenter suggested that an appropriate remedy to this issue is making sure that we self-care more. That night, having been deprived of our usual time to work on things, myself and most of the other RA's in my building were up until 2 am working on bulletin boards and floor decorations before the school year had even started. \n\nI think my main complaint here is that the University as a whole is so incredibly blind to the needs of it's students, and deaf to their complaints. Do you know why we got a 7 hour training on self care? It wasn't for us. We were taught less about how to self care for ourselves, and more how to help others find self care strategies. It was so we could teach it to our residents, and so we knew how to help our residents work on it because mental health is such a wide-spread problem, not just in University Housing, but on the campus as a whole. Mental health is something that not only I struggle with, but so do my friends, my coworkers, my residents, my coworker's residents, my classmates, etc. And it's not as easy as just going to the Counseling Center. I don't know how many of you have tried lately to get regular support from the campus counseling center, but let me tell you, its damn near impossible. The Counseling Center is **OVERRUN** with students *all the time*. You would think that this would be a signal to the University that maybe they need to focus more on the mental health needs of their students. But instead, they ignore it and put it on their housing staff to solve the problem. While some students are slaving away, working two jobs just to be able to afford to go here while scraping by in their classes, the University decides to hike up the tuition rate. The Counseling Center is ALWAYS full and counselors are always in demand. Yet, instead of hiring more licensed professionals to help take care of the depressed, anxious, and in some cases, suicidal students, they give Tim Killeen a $100,000 bonus for doing such a good job writing the Massmails. Mental health is such an important issue, and we have students in the residence halls *every single year* attempt to take their own lives. I've seen a few cases just this last semester. And it kills me every time, because no one deserves to feel ignored. No one deserves to feel forgotten. But I feel like the mental health needs of the students on this campus HAVE been forgotten. \n\nToday during our weekly staff meeting, we talked about all of the complaints we had and improvements we think needed to be made on the training this year. And I made the point that I feel like we are not being heard. Moreso, we are actively being ignored by Housing. The same way the students of this campus as a whole are being actively ignored by the University. They act like they care, and they preached to the RA's and MA's for 7 hour straight about self-care, all the while taking away 7 hours worth of potential self-care from the very students they lectured. They preach tolerance and social justice, and then hire the least tolerant association they could find to give us a biased speech on anti-Semitism. I don't know what the solution here is. My hopes is that this will piss someone off enough that the administration of the University will read it. That someone with power will actually listen. Or at the very least, that maybe if there's enough of us rallying for it, maybe we can make some change on this campus. Because I'm sick and tired of being ignored by the University. I'm sick and tired of the mental health needs of all of us being forgotten.

Something has to change here, and I'm prepared to organize something (ANYTHING really) to attempt to make a difference. So I would like to call upon all of you to help me out in this endeavor. \n\n**STEP 1: Spam the Chancellor's Office**\n\nI don't care if you do it through text, or through a link, or through your own personally written,  strongly worded email, we need to make sure the people of the office of the Chancellor get this message. You can send [this link of the original post,](https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/esouvt/maybe_ill_get_fired_but_fuck_housing/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) or just the text to the following emails below, as well as any other higher up administration emails that you guys can find. The ones below are specifically of people within the office of the Chancellor. \n\n**Executive Assistant to the Chancellor**\n\n[wbertram@illinois.edu](mailto:wbertram@illinois.edu)\n\n**Administrative Aide**\n\n[carswell@illinois.edu](mailto:carswell@illinois.edu)\n\n[halkire@illinois.edu](mailto:halkire@illinois.edu)\n\n[nigh@illinois.edu](mailto:nigh@illinois.edu)\n\n**Office Administrator**\n\n[tsharris@illinois.edu](mailto:tsharris@illinois.edu)\n\n[lisak2@illinois.edu](mailto:lisak2@illinois.edu)\n\n**Office Manager**\n\n[kbilbo@illinois.edu](mailto:kbilbo@illinois.edu)\n\nThese are all I've had time to find while in class, I may post an update with more I find later. I've already sent the link once to each email. Lets make sure they can't ignore it. \n\n**STEP 2: ORGANIZE THE RA's AND MA's**\n\nThe more I've been talking to people, the more I believe that the RA's and MA's need to unite and possibly unionize. If anyone has experience in these kind of things, or knows how to begin such an organization, please reach out to me and lets get something off the ground here. I'm sick of slaving away for minimal recompense, and I think each and every parapro deserves more. Yet year after year, they take more and more away. Once upon a time, the RA's on this campus had so much more. Once upon a time, our benefits were comparable to other universities. Yet now we make significantly less money per month, our tuition is unaffected, our requirements are stricter, we don't get to choose our building, and now they've taken away our bathrooms and are shoving hypocrisy down our throats. Where do we cross the line? Where does it stop? The answer is \"right here, right now\". We need to organize and take back some of the benefits that we deserve for our efforts. [It's time to stop!](https://imgur.com/gallery/CoWZ05t) Stop taking away our benfits, stop working us harder and paying us less. Stop punishing us for the action (or moreso inaction) of our residents. How ridiculous is it that residents recieve no repercussions for refusing to do their iConvo's, but if we, the RA's, dont complete enough of them, regardless of cooperation from the residents, we get punished. Threatened with our jobs. I've had enough and I'm sure most of my fellow RA's have too. Support your RA, your MA, your friends, etc, and help us get this off the ground. If anyone has experience in such things, please contact me and we can go further into what can be done.\n\n**STEP 3: PROTEST**\n\nI've heard tell of a Mental Health Protest that may have taken place in the past. Whether or not it did, I think we need to do one, and do it soon. This is another instance in which I would love to work with someone who has some ideas for it to organize such a protest. We need to make our voices heard and let them know we aren't going to stand for this blatant ignorance of our most basic mental health needs. So once again, if anyone would like to help me organize this as well, PM me or comment down below and we'll organize this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's time to make a difference, because there are too many people who agree with my original post for us not to join together and make a difference.

It's a \"newly remodeled\" building that apparently used to be a retirement home or something like that. It has a huge baseboard heater that lines the perimeter walls of the building. So this includes the living room wall, and then two walls of the bedroom. \n\nWell in the bedroom one specific part of the heater rattles extremely loud on and off. I'm not sure if it's when the heat kicks in at a certain temperature that it starts to shake extremely loud, but it's not constant through out the day. However, when it does kick in I can hear it from the kitchen. It's so loud and distracting that even when I'm in the living room I have to shut the bedroom door, and even then I can still hear it somewhat. I actually recorded it and showed it to my friend and he was even surprised at how loud it was. \n\nIts mainly a problem at night when I try to sleep. I've tried multiple times to sleep through it but it's just not possible. It'll wake me up multiple times through out the night. I've resorted to sleeping on the couch, which is super uncomfortable and causes me to wake up with knots in my shoulder/neck.\n\nI've submit a request to GSR but I haven't heard back from them. If they were no help I was going to go to the student tenant union and see if there was anything I could do about this.  I personally don't think it's fair that I'm paying 1,000 for rent for a place I can't even sleep in my own bed. \n\nI was just wondering if anyone else had a similar problem, or any advice I could take into consideration. \n\nTLDR; unable to sleep in bedroom because baseboard heater rattles extremely loud.

I'm a senior looking to graduate after Fall 2020 semester because I'm also doing a minor. I took CS 374 last semester and honestly I ate shit in that class (as in barely passed, sorry Jeff); on top of it being notoriously hard to most students who end up taking it, the topics covered just weren't that interesting to me. That said, early on during last semester I was suggested by my math advisor to take CS 473 after completing 374, and as foolish as this sounds I kind of just said \"ok\" and went and registered for it when the time to register for Spring 2020 classes came without looking into what exactly it was or what the other options I had were.  \nThose other options in the Group V category, for which as a Math &amp; CS major I have to complete one, are: \\[CS 473\\], \\[CS 475\\], \\[CS 476\\], \\[CS 477\\], \\[CS 481\\], \\[CS 482\\], and \\[MATH 414\\].  \nNow after finding out that CS 473 is actually a follow up to CS 374, and that Jeff is cancelling the IDK = 25% partial credit policy this semester, I really don't want to actually continue taking it. The trouble is, which class do I then take? I looked into CS 477 and it did seem like a decent alternative to take instead but it seems to be restricted to graduate level only? And I guess I could take CS 476 but from what people have posted in the past on here CS 477 is the better of the two. I heard CS 475 has actually been dead for a while and will probably not be offered again anytime soon. As for the rest of the Group Vs, I'm just not too sure about taking due to lack of information about them.  \nSince I have virtually committed to the fact that I will be staying an extra semester, I would also be open to taking one of these in the Fall 2020 semester, if it happens that the best option isn't offered in the Spring but is offered in the Fall. Any advice would be appreciated.  \n\n\ntl;dr As a Math &amp; CS major, among CS473, CS475, CS476, CS477, CS481, CS482, and MATH414 which class should I take if I struggled in and found uninteresting CS374, either in this SP2020 semester, over Summer, in FA2020 semester, or in Winter after FA20?", "title": "Math &amp; CS Group V Class Advice"}, {"created_utc": 1580216739, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/ev5cq9/music_rsos/", "id": "ev5cq9", "is_self": true, "score": 1, "selftext": "I was wondering if there was any music/DJing organizations on campus that teach you how to make music and dj.

Of our 10 homework assignments throughout the semester, two of them still have not been graded (not including the optional bonus homework, which of course is also ungraded). The class had its final on December 17, 2019, which means that it has been over a month since the end of this class. \n\nWhen taking our final exam, we had even fewer homework assignments graded, not to mention that our second midterm hadn't been graded yet. The final was broken down into 25% Midterm 1 content, 25% Midterm 2 content, and 50% post-Midterm 2 content. In other words, we had to take a final on a course where approximately *3/4* of our assignments were NOT graded. The point of exams is to assess one's comprehension of a course's material, and that has been simply impossible to do for this class because we did not receive in a timely manner. \n\nWhen asking Professor Borisov about this complete lack of grading we've gotten curt responses such as \"We had a few MIA graders; I'm hoping to get 4 and 5 finished by this weekend.\" Just last week, someone went to our class's Piazza to ask if the last grades were coming out. We received this response: \"HW9 grades will be out this week.\" Guess what? The grades are still not up.\n\nI find this unprofessional attitude towards learning to be quite disappointing for such a highly-esteemed university. Our university should have systems in place so that we do not have to wait until *Christmas day* for midterms to be graded. I hope this open letter will insight some change within the department. In fact, I propose a one-month rule to grading. Assignments must be graded within 30 days of its due date. This, in my opinion, is a fair and simple rule that allows students to get timely feedback on their work so they can learn and improve. \n\nCome on CS@Illinois, let's do better.", "title": "An Open Letter to CS@Illinois and Professor Borisov"}, {"created_utc": 1580234180, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/ev8vjd/question_for_anyone_in_ps_351/", "id": "ev8vjd", "is_self": true, "score": 0, "selftext": "The syllabus says attendance is mandatory/graded, but I haven\u2019t noticed an attendance sheet going around or anything?

Last semester was pretty easy for me. I took 14 credit hours, joined three RSOs (one as a board member), and got two good friend groups, all while adjusting to being away from home for the first time in my life, and this was all very manageable for me. There was one somewhat hard class but other than that it was smooth sailing. But so far this semester it\u2019s a different story. I\u2019m taking 16 credit hours (soon to be 18) and just from credit hours it doesn\u2019t seem like much more work, but each class I\u2019m taking this semester has a much bigger workload than any of my classes did last semester. Along with that I\u2019m starting in a new major, taking on more responsibilities in two of the RSOs I\u2019m in, and I might have to start making frequent trips home due to family obligations. \n\nI should probably mention that I did miss the first week of classes due to some seizures I had in the three day weekend before classes started, and I just came back to Champaign this past Friday. I\u2019m holding out hope that my workload will seem more manageable once I\u2019m fully re-adjusted to being back at UIUC and I get used to my new medication, but I\u2019m thinking that this won\u2019t be the case.\n\nHere\u2019s where the problem gets worse. I\u2019m a perfectionist. A *huge* perfectionist. I hardly ever show it, but I\u2019m always criticizing myself for the smallest things I do wrong or can\u2019t accomplish. I\u2019m never a perfectionist when it comes to mistakes that others make, only for myself. And I usually never go to anybody when I have problems because when I\u2019m feeling down on myself I don\u2019t want to bring anybody else down with me. So I think the main thing I want to ask is, how do I let myself take on less responsibility? If this semester ends up being too much for me to handle, how do I convince myself to drop a class, or step back from some RSO responsibilities? And if I do maintain all of my responsibilities and I end up failing, how do I handle this failure without hating myself for it? If anybody\u2019s ever had something like this happen to them, please share your story if you\u2019re willing.", "title": "How to let myself take on less responsibilities if I end up needing to?"}, {"created_utc": 1580259092, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/evf0fn/volo_broadband_issues/", "id": "evf0fn", "is_self": true, "score": 2, "selftext": "Anyone else experiencing issues with volo internet lately.

You showed me true love, then crushed it to a million jagged pieces beneath the weight of a tin tray of \"lasagna\". \n\nIt all started this morning, when out of curiosity, I opened the UIUC Dining app. I browsed through the breakfast and lunch menus, hoping to see something worth trekking to Ike over. But alas, there was nothing besides your usual fare of soggy vegetables and chicken. I selected on the dinner menu, expecting yet another disappointment.\n\nBut then...could it be? Were my eyes deceiving me?\n\nThere it was, listed right under Hortensia's. My forgotten love. My Italian beauty.\n\nTortellini with Pesto Cream. \n\nOh, the nights you I had with your Tortellini with Pesto Cream. Long days, weeks even of sub-par cafeteria food were suddenly made worthwhile when I slid my fork into the delicate folds of the dough. The taste of the sauce, creamy yet fresh, was like ecstasy on my tongue.  The *al-dente* texture perfectly complimented your luxuriously rich cheesy filling. \n\nIt was nights like those when I didn't realize how lucky I was to have those beautifully rounded noodles on my plate. \n\nTonight, I hoped, would be no different from those previous nights where I had the pleasure of consuming Tortellini with Pesto Cream. I practically floated to the cafeteria, guided by the thought of the warm noodles filling my empty stomach. With the force of a thousand waterfalls, I pulled open the doors, determined to be reunited with the pasta of my dreams. Time blurred as I swiped in my card and grabbed my plate to join the others in line, waiting to be blessed by your wheaty, cheesy fruit. \n\nThe line was short. A fluke, I thought. Doubt would not ruin my night, no. I was going to get that tortellini, no matter the cost.\n\nBut I was wrong. As I got closer and closer to the spot where my beloved delicacy should have lay, my eyes were greeted with the sight of a bare spot, with none of my Tortellini with Pesto Cream. \n\n\"Is...is there no more tortellini?\" I asked the worker.\n\n\"No, sorry,\" he replied. \n\nI was in disbelief. I looked behind him, desperately hoping for cheesy, creamy salvation. Could there be hidden final tray of my Italian beauty? But I saw nothing but emptiness.\n\nAnd then, as if to drive the knife in deeper, I saw the replacement. A hideous, greasy, impasta. It stared at me, the repulsive mushrooms and cheese swirling together in a vile, barely solid mixture. There it was- Mushroom Lasagna, sitting smugly in the spot where my Tortellini with Pesto Cream should have lay. \n\nAs the line behind me grew impatient, I tried to scoop some onto my plate, but a wave of revulsion and grief hit me so powerfully that I fled the line in despair. \n\nI ended the night at Penne Lane, burying my despair in the comforting mediocrity of linguine and marinara. \n\nDinner was painful, each bite reminding me of what I could have had if I had just come to you a little sooner.\n\nBut you had destroy me, Ike. You had to taunt me with promises of pasta heaven, only to spit in my face when I entered your doors.\n\nPerhaps the deepest pain I felt was when I looked at your future menus, only to find dinners barren of Tortellini with Pesto Cream. I had missed my window to Heaven, and now I was stuck in a chicken and linguine flavored purgatory. \n\nI want to scream into the void, \"I was a fool for taking you for granted, Tortellini with Pesto Cream!\" But you won't hear me, you never will. \n\nIke, tonight you broke my heart.", "title": "On the subject of tortellini"}, {"created_utc": 1580437452, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/ewh5ro/are_biz_frats_rigged/", "id": "ewh5ro", "is_self": true, "score": 1, "selftext": "I noticed a few things and decided to list them. \n- During business fraternity and Business Council rush, I saw a lot of brothers were from the same social frats &amp; sororities, as well as the same suburbs. \n-Also during rush I noticed large amounts of nepotism.

Yes, some days, the place can be loud, and people can be gross in the bathroom. However, for the most part, I enjoy living in the dorms, and it's an experience that I wouldn't take back. I'm only going to do it for this year for a couple reasons. The reasons listed earlier and then the fact that I am forced to go to these community conversations.\n\nWhen signing up for dorms, I specifically made sure not to choose a living-learning-community because I didn't want to deal with following the extreme rules. I expected in a regular dorm like Scott Hall would have a typical floor meeting. I thought that maybe every once in a while, we could have an optional discussion where those that wanted to have a conversation about issues they're passionate about could do so in their own free time. I figured that those who wish to discuss can discuss their own free will, and the rest of us could go on our days and work our jobs or go to class. I was wrong. We are forced to go to these meetings and I don't know why. In my experience when you are forced to have a discussion about an issue it is never enjoyable to talk about. \n\nI chose Scott Hall because it seemed to be a pretty basic dorm. It had AC, it was near the IKE dining hall, and it wasn't a terrible distance from the quad like PAR seemed to be. At the start of the year, the whole dorm was told that we would be required to attend five community conversations dubbed \"Down With Dunia.\" If we did not attend, then there would be \"consequences.\" We were never told what those consequences would be, but I decided to play it safe and attend all five of the conversations. I didn't love going to five meetings. Still, I got it done because I didn't want to face any punishments, but now we are being told that we have to do another five this semester. Currently, I have no plan on going to these, but I want to be sure I won't get screwed and would like to bring more awareness to this stupidity. While at these meetings a first semester, most of us that actually showed up all agreed on one thing: The MA, Dunia, is extremely biased and targeted towards certain groups of people. She is very vocal about her distaste for the Zionist Movement. She is admittedly an \"Anti-Zionist,\" and she leads these protests around campus. I even believe that she was the one that the Chancellor's email about anti-semitism was about. I feel like someone who is supposed to educate the students in a dorm about \"acceptance and understanding\" should not be someone that is so unaccepting and so against a certain group of people. \n\nThe thing that ruffles my feathers is that we are forced to go to these meetings where none of us like the person conducting the meeting, and might possibly face punishment if we don't go. Why are we required to go to these meetings? Is Scott Hall allowed to force us to go to these meetings? Scott Hall isn't an LLC by any means, and I don't see any other dorms being required to go to these types of meetings. I have friends in the other dorms like Snyder(which is an actual LLC, and they don't have to do this). They say that their MA's meetings are all optional and, in general, their Multicultural Advocates are pretty nice people. We were never even given the option to review or give our thoughts to University Housing about our MA like we were for the RA. I feel if they were to receive reviews on the MA in Scott, then maybe they could at least teach her how to be more respectful of others, and better do her job. If not, I feel like she shouldn't be in the position she is in. \n\nBut the main thing this whole post was about is just about the simple question. Can the university actually do anything if you don't go to all five meetings, or are they just empty threats? I would like to know because I know a few people that didn't go to any at all and haven't been punished yet.", "title": "Dorms forcing residents to go to \"Community Conversations\""}, {"created_utc": 1580711919, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/ey2wba/rejected_from_microsoft/", "id": "ey2wba", "is_self": true, "score": 1, "selftext": "I feel like shit, honestly. \n\nThe interviewers were all smiley until I ended up talking with a gloomy hiring manager who refused to give me a job.

After the professor left, I packed my stuff and left the room and walked halfway to the exit when I realised I had forgotten my wallet. I rushed back to the room, and when I was about to open the door, this one guy opens the door holding my wallet. He gives it to me asking if it is mine. I was quite surprised by this since there was no one else in the room when I left, and no one had entered it either when I was in the hallway. This man, whom I did not recognise, had a sadistic smile, with his teeth literally looking like fangs. I nervously thanked him and took the wallet and realised it was sticky. To my further shock I saw that his hand had a bunch of deep wounds and scars that did not look small to be neglected. By now I was really beginning to get scared, so I hurriedly took my wallet and began speed walking away.

During his senior year, he was the chairman of the Senior Memorial Committee, which was the group responsible for raising funds for the Senior Memorial Chime. His predecessor, Edwards Hall Berry \u201914, led the committee in 1914 and raised over $1,000 (equivalent to $25,500 today) for the project. Yes, the committee raised that much money from their classmates in 1914!\n\nKnapp was adamant to raise a similar amount, if not more, but the committee struggled to get their fellow classmates to pay dues amounting to $2.50 (equivalent to $64 today). As graduation neared, the committee was $500 short of their goal. In an attempt of what might be seen as desperation, Knapp threatened to publish the names of his classmates who have not yet paid (or promised to pay) their dues. The next day, he was featured in a Daily Illini editorial, stating that he regretted what he had said, but still wanted those seniors to contribute. By the end of the 1914-1915 academic year, the committee met their goal of raising at least $1,000.", "title": "100 Years of Senior Memorial Chime History, Episode 1"}, {"created_utc": 1581111644, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/f0hevq/maryland_basketball_ticket/", "id": "f0hevq", "is_self": true, "score": 1, "selftext": "I\u2019m selling a ticket for tonight\u2019s basketball game!

There are four sophomore\u2019s (M) including myself that are currently signed for next year, looking for our special #5 \ud83d\ude0a Some basic information about the apartment: 5 bedroom (three downstairs, two up), 2.5 bathrooms (1 full both upstairs and down, and a half bath (toilet and shower only) downstairs as well), additional sinks in the laundry room which also has a washer and dryer, kitchen with dish washer, microwave, toaster, oven, double sink, fridge, cabinet space, living area with countertop and high chairs, couch, large Samsung smart tv, glass coffee table, sliding glass doors out to the balcony (even nicer given we are on the fourth, and top, floor), and a skinny spiral staircase up to the second floor. Each bedroom has a large wooden desk (new this year), four drawers of dresser space (broken up into two-two drawer mini dressers that can fit underneath bed if desired), a full sized bed that has a medium loft (lower than dorm lofts), and an open closet. The complex does NOT have an elevator, which can be annoying at first given that we are on the fourth floor. I've come to accept and appreciate the stairs however, as they ensure you get just a tad of exercise everyday even during times when you have no spare time to actually go to the gym. Additionally, we have a few consoles in the apartment, PS4, PSVR, Xbox 360, Nintendo Switch, and the Wii. While these are owned by individuals, we tend to be a very sharing and involving community. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLocation information: \n\nWe are a 3 minute walk from the engineering quad, where there is also a bus stop for the 120E/W Teal, that can take you to the union, south down Goodwin, south past Allen hall, and arriving at par. Can get to most anywhere on campus with little outside exposure utilizing this bus stop to take you to more populated stops. We are just north of Legends, so we are also ridiculously close to tons of food and bars on Green street. 5-10 minute walk to County Market (groceries). We already have two cars, so generally it is easy to reach other shopping locations as well when necessary (Walmart, Malls, etc.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinancial information: \n\nThis apartment is leased through JSM. Monthly rent is 649 including all utilities aside from electric (Electric averages at 20$ additional monthly, for an estimated monthly total of 670$). The complex has parking spaces available for yearly purchase for additional costs, both in a garage underneath the complex, and in a lot immediately next door.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRoommate information:\n\nI will not include the actual names of my roommates in this post. I will refer to them as Smith, Jack, and Mark. My name is Nic and I am a computer science major. When I'm not living in Siebel, I'll be playing my keyboard, gaming, binging some shows in the living room, or getting some much needed R&amp;R on the balcony ;). I'm a cleanly person, and when I get stressed I like to clean, so being a CS major I clean rather frequently and vigorously. Because of these factors, I tend to do a majority of the cleaning in the apartment (vacuum, dishes, cleaning counters, oven, microwaves, bathrooms etc.), and am happy to do so. Some of my other hobbies include scuba diving, hiking, spike ball, and biking. Jack and Mark are my current roommates (same apartment as advertised here), and Smith is my highschool buddy that will be joining us next year. Smith is a wholehearted fellow who is musically talented as well (clarinet, bass clarinet, piano). Smith is an ECE major. Jack is a meme lord who is still trying to narrow down his educational passions. He spends his time watching wacky things on youtube, modding videogames to the point of no return, and stressing about not knowing what to do with his life. Mark is a civil engineering major who often beats me to the balcony for R&amp;R. Mark is very introverted and quiet around new people, and takes some time to get to know. Through time, he will open up and you will begin to see similarities between him and Jack. Mark also has a keyboard in his room and fiddles on occasion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNeighbor information: \n\nThis year (2019-2020) most people in my group of friends decided to move into apartments together. We moved into two five person apartments right next to each other. Five of us guys moved into our apartment, and five of the girls moved into the one next door. We are a pretty open and close knit group between the two apartments, roaming between the two apartments freely. We often celebrate birthdays, holidays, and other occasions together. Whenever a party or gathering is desired, we always dedicate one apartment to be the study zone, and dedicate the other for the party to ensure that everybody always has a space to do what they want to do. Again, for this general information post, I wont be using their true names. Some basic information on the wonderful ladies next door. Mary is a photography major, slightly introverted but willing to open up with time. Gertrude  is a CS major who is the nicest and sweetest person you'll ever meet. Sally is a food scientist, always cooking up wonderfully yummy food for the apartments to snack on. May is an MCB major from California and is the cutest, smartest, most adorable friend you could ask for. Jaycee is a psychology major with a spanish minor and is super chill and often joins Mark and I out on the balcony. Were you to sign onto our lease, you would have the opportunity to meet, and grow closer to both the find gentlemen in our apartment, and the wonderful women next door. You would have access to two apartments worth of space rather than just ours.\n\n\\*While we are seeking a roommate for the 'guys' apartment, that does not exclude females from joining us! As I've said, in joining us you will be welcomed in both apartments and can spend your hours wherever you most please!\n\nI've tried to include as much relevant information as possible to paint you a picture what living with us might be like, but it is impossible to encapsulate all of our living dynamics in one post. If you would like to learn more, get to know me, set up a time to see the apartment, or other, feel free to DM me. From there, I can provide some more personal contact information.

Keep in mind this is mostly for everyone that keeps wanting to transfer to CS, however, this is also a good note for anyone wanting to transfer to any engineering major here. These are things that I noticed that people did and were successful in their attempts (in most cases).\n\n1. If you were admitted to pre-engineering but want to apply for another engineering or non-engineering major if you decide that engineering isn't for you, you can always submit an **APPEAL TO CHANGE MAJOR** form although this would be worth risking your original seat in pre-engineering.  I know of this person who originally applied to BioE but wasn't sure if she wanted to pursue the major so she appealed to Engineering Undeclared and got in and now is sitting comfortably pursuing CS. Alternatively, one of my roommates was originally admitted as a pre-engineering major but knew that engineering wasn't for him so he appealed and is now in Political Science \n2. Another option if you were admitted as a **pre-engineering is to check out ARISE** ([https://students.grainger.illinois.edu/arise/home/](https://students.grainger.illinois.edu/arise/home/)) which admits students **DIRECTLY to the college of engineering - you still have to apply.** I don't know much about the program but I heard from someone that they treat you like engineering undeclared majors and the advisors there work with you directly to get into the classes you need (especially for restricted classes). You still have to apply to the program but it caters to students from low-income backgrounds and who's scores/gpa weren't high enough for CoE. The downside is that it is **a 5 year program** instead of a 4 year program which could factor in some financial costs/decisions for you to make. Definitely check out **Illinois Promise and Illinois Commitment scholarships for in state students**\n3. If you REALLY WANT TO DO CS AND YOU'RE IN PREP.... just take everyone's word and **go to the university that accepted you for CS instead of coming here hoping to win the lottery**. You can search the subreddit is you really want to know how to transfer to CS\n4. For the sake of saving money and don't know what you want to do but want to some sort of engineering (yes, even CS), definitely check out your community college engineering pathway programs. As long as you meet the classes and the GPA requirements for your CC, you will get into your major at a partnering university with the pathways program.\n\nIMO, you are better off **applying to ARISE depending if you're from a low income background** or if not, look into other options.\n\nIf you do end up coming here in pre-engineering and wanting to transfer into some \"high demand\" major (CS,MechE,BioE), be sure to have a plan involving other majors or transferring to another university.", "title": "CLASS OF 2024 AND BEYOND: ALTERNATIVES TO PRE-ENGINEERING"}, {"created_utc": 1581368271, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/f1ws5l/to_the_idiot_thats_smoking_a_blunt_in_front_of/", "id": "f1ws5l", "is_self": true, "score": 2, "selftext": "fuck you, not everyone wants to smell that, how inconsiderate and dumb could you be?", "title": "to the idiot that\u2019s smoking a blunt in front of the union:"}, {"created_utc": 1581368940, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/f1wym5/greatest_mumble_rapper_alive/", "id": "f1wym5", "is_self": true, "score": 1, "selftext": "professor doug jones could be the best\nmumble rapper in the game right now", "title": "greatest mumble rapper alive"}, {"created_utc": 1581369055, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/f1wzpg/cmn_101_gies/", "id": "f1wzpg", "is_self": true, "score": 1, "selftext": "I'm looking to transfer into Gies from LAS and I want to know if this course is huge in trying to make a successful transfer.

The thing is, when I applied originally, I had significant national awards in chemistry olympiads and was seriously considering double majoring in cs and chemistry in the college that I eventually decided to attend. I ended up applying only CS at UIUC originally as I wasn\u2019t sure I wanted that binding to chem this early on, and I wasn\u2019t allowed to choose CS+chem as a second choice. However, I\u2019ve now decided I definitely want to do chemistry as well, and decided to appeal my decision applying to CS + Chem. My question is just wondering if there is any chance of this actually going through, or if it will mainly be a roll of the dice to see if theres open spots in the major.

Very few majors serve as work credentials. The return on investment for your degree, no matter what it is, will largely depend on your ability to connect the skills you acquire in college to the needs of employers. \n\nNo matter what you study, expect to grow intellectually and work hard to gain relevant experience in pursuit of your life goals. At the moment, tech/computer skills are in high demand and employers offer large entry-level salaries to students with those skills. Students with other skill sets will not earn as much in their entry-level jobs, but those differentials level out over time, and salary is only one measure of success. \n\nI have seen so many students stick with programs of study that make them miserable out of a mistaken belief that the major they chose will inevitably lead to success. The reality is, no one will hand you a stable, well-paying job in exchange for your diploma and GPA, no matter what words are on that diploma. You will find a satisfying career through some combination of skill, interest, motivation, and relevant experience, and a low-paying job that gets you started on a career path you love may be the first step. Or a well-paying sales job that you don\u2019t love but that helps you pay down your debt while you assess your next moves may be the first step. \n\nIt's your life, and you're in control of how you live it. Avoid the mistake that many others have made in assuming that the choice of the \u201cright\u201d major will eliminate the need to think hard about your strengths and priorities and seek out ways to build your skills both inside and outside the classroom in pursuit of the life you want.", "title": "Dear worried majors of all varieties, please stop"}, {"created_utc": 1582302400, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/f7dj0r/can_a_nonus_citizen_apply_for_a_visa_to_india/", "id": "f7dj0r", "is_self": true, "score": 1, "selftext": "I want to go to India for travel in May and have some questions about Indian Visa. \n\nI am a Japanese citizen and have a Japanese passport.

I didn't mind it as much her Facetiming since I would often times leave the room to head to the ARC, get food, etc. The sad part is that I knew more about her through her Facetiming her friends than actually talking to her (again, I'm barely in the dorm). \n\nMove forward to the beginning of this semester when I came back after break at 2 in the morning and noticed that she wasn't in the dorm. Usually she is asleep by then. I really didn't mind it at first and she came back the following day and stayed at our dorm for over a week until one day I came back to the dorm around 3 am at night and she wasn't in the dorm - she usually is fast asleep around midnight. And so the next two nights she's been missing in action until she comes back on the third night and I overheard her facetiming her mom how she spent the past 4 nights at the bar and vaguely talks about a dude. \n\nThen the next couple of days she would stay at our dorm until last week I noticed she had a bag and a purse packed of stuff on her bed. I remember I came back to the dorm at 9pm on Wednesday after my CBTF and she got her bags and left a minute after I came into the room... she wasn't back until 2 days later in the morning when I woke up for my 10am class. And it wasn't until that Friday night when she was facetiming her NEW boyfriend (thought she was with her old boyfriend that she was with for over a year) who has an apartment. She slept in our dorm that Friday night but instead of having her bags ready Saturday, she had a drawstring bag and a face full of makeup ready to go to a party. Again, I didn't mind that she went out that night but still .. she hasn't come back to the dorm until Sunday at noon when I was working on my homework - she came in the room, grabbed a charger and left. Didn't come back that night or Monday morning. Until now, I came into the dorm after my shower and she was there for a couple of minutes, standing by her desk for a bit wearing her backpack and left her apple watch charging and left. \n\nAlthough I didn't mind her leaving for the time around, I am now concerned and didn't do anything wrong as a roommate (always tidy, left the room during a call, didn't make any disruptive noises, etc.) however she never sleeps at the dorm. As I said earlier, we don't really have a common ground and barely talk since we come from different backgrounds - she's a fine arts major, whereas I am in STEM.\n\nSorry if this post is long as hell, I really don't know where to rant this too and really need advice.

I didn't mind it as much her Facetiming since I would often times leave the room to head to the ARC, get food, etc. The sad part is that I knew more about her through her Facetiming her friends than actually talking to her (again, I'm barely in the dorm).\n\nMove forward to the beginning of this semester when I came back after break at 2 in the morning and noticed that she wasn't in the dorm. Usually she is asleep by then. I really didn't mind it at first and she came back the following day and stayed at our dorm for over a week until one day I came back to the dorm around 3 am at night and she wasn't in the dorm - she usually is fast asleep around midnight. And so the next two nights she's been missing in action until she comes back on the third night and I overheard her facetiming her mom how she spent the past 4 nights at the bar and vaguely talks about a dude.\n\nThen the next couple of days she would stay at our dorm until last week I noticed she had a bag and a purse packed of stuff on her bed. I remember I came back to the dorm at 9pm on Wednesday after my CBTF and she got her bags and left a minute after I came into the room... she wasn't back until 2 days later in the morning when I woke up for my 10am class. And it wasn't until that Friday night when she was facetiming her NEW boyfriend (thought she was with her old boyfriend that she was with for over a year) who has an apartment. She slept in our dorm that Friday night but instead of having her bags ready Saturday, she had a drawstring bag and a face full of makeup ready to go to a party. Again, I didn't mind that she went out that night but still .. she hasn't come back to the dorm until Sunday at noon when I was working on my homework - she came in the room, grabbed a charger and left. Didn't come back that night or Monday morning. Until now, I came into the dorm after my shower and she was there for a couple of minutes, standing by her desk for a bit wearing her backpack and left her apple watch charging and left.\n\nAlthough I didn't mind her leaving for the time around, I am now concerned and didn't do anything wrong as a roommate (always tidy, left the room during a call, didn't make any disruptive noises, etc.) however she never sleeps at the dorm. As I said earlier, we don't really have a common ground and barely talk since we come from different backgrounds - she's a fine arts major, whereas I am in STEM.\n\nSorry if this post is long as hell, I really don't know where to rant this too and really need advice.

I'm not associated with your school, and have never been to Illinois. I'm just trying to solve a mystery.\n\nI live in Pennsylvania and work for a trucking company. Last night I loaded 20,000lbs of machined steel parts destined for the University of Illinois via our Chicago terminal. They came from a company in central Pennsylvania and are already on the road to your neck of the woods as we speak.\n\nThe reason I'm here is to see if anyone on your end can help me figure out what the heck they were! I'm just so curious! Are there any major construction projects? Is anything of note being installed? They were very distinct, and even for someone who's been loading trucks for 7 years, 20,000lbs of steel is a lot! But what made me the most curious is that they were addressed directly to your school (as the consignee).\n\nUnfortunately, I wasn't able to get a picture. So I'll do my best to describe them. There were a total of 18 pieces on 9 pallets. Each part was about 4 feet by 2 feet by 2 feet. They reminded me of a huge engine block, but they weren't the right shape at all. They were roughly rectangular, made of machined steel with several bits of threaded rod sticking out vertically from the top. Each had 4 or 5 large spring-valves at their core, aligned vertically as well.\n\nAs I said, they reminded me of part of a combination engine... If you've ever seen a combustion motor with it's valve cover off, each part looked like a chunk of a wildly oversized valve train. They obviously weren't the right scale for anything like that, so I think they may be part of a huge hydraulic system... But, like, a hydraulic system that could lift a stadium!\n\nIf you can think of anything that might fit the bill... something that these might be going to, let me know! Any ideas are welcome!

Currently, it is NOT ACTIVE so 1-800-273-8255 is still the active number for the hotline, however the national crisis hotline will soon be changed to 988. So you would deal 988 just like you would dial 911. I'll try to follow the development of that and keep you all updated as to when it is active.\n\nThere is also a currently active [Crisis Textline](https://www.crisistextline.org). To access this, just text HOME to 741741 and they will connect you with a crisis counselor, whom you can text as long as you need help.\n\nAgain, for those of you who haven't yet and would like to, I have a Discord set up which is linked in my previous posts. I'm attempting a different approach to the Housing issue, and will see if it makes a difference. We'll see if it makes a difference. But feel free to join the discord, whether you are passionate about mental health, or making a change in Housing (or both) that is the place to do it. I'll add the invite link in an edit. \n\nThose of you who are RA's, MA's, or otherwise, please be sure to share the Crisis Textline to your residents and communities, and do the same for 988 when it is finalized and active. Thank you guys for your support. I'm hoping that someday soon, it doesn't take a student running into the counseling center in tears and panic for them to get an appointment.

The dataset, which is a subset of the MODIS Cloud Mask product, consists of a collection of 64x64 pixel images with each pixel representing 1x1 km area, corresponding to a multi- channel spectral imagery. The dataset also contains labels for each pixel indicating presence or absence of clouds. For more details, refer to this wiki page at https://wiki.illinois.edu/wiki/display/~kindrtnk/Cloud+Detection+in+MODIS+Satellite+Images .\nDatasets: Data will be provided on HAL cluster at the time of the competition. \n\nPROJECT 2: SPIKING NEURAL NETWORK \nProblem: The objective is to train a model to move a (cyber)-octopus with two soft arms and a head to reach a target location, and then grab an object. The octopus is modeled as an assembly of Cosserat rods and is activated by muscles surrounding its arms. Input to the mechanical model is the activation signals to the surrounding muscles, which causes it to contract, thus moving the arms. The output of the model comes from the octopus's environment. The mechanical model will be provided both for the octopus and its interaction with its environment. The goal is to find the correct muscle activation signals that make the octopus crawl to reach the target location and then make one arm to grab the object.

I am a Stats+CS sophomore. I have pretty good grades (4.0 first 3 semesters, 100% all tests this semester but one, on which I got 96%), but I have pretty much nothing else. And GPA doesn't really matter, as employers care more about your experience and projects and stuff. And that is probably because I have been taking easy introductory classes thus far, and once I start taking actual hard classes like CS 241 and CS 374, my GPA is probably going to start going down. I have absolutely no work experience. I have very little club experience, and I barely learned anything there. I have no research experience. I have not even done a single out of class project. During the school year, I usually feel buried by schoolwork and lack the time and energy, and during breaks, I try to study for the next semester's classes, did the GRE at one point, but I just have no motivation. I hate studying and have no interest in CS or statistics. I pretty much picked the major because my parents told me to. I don't have any interest in anything else, either. \n\nAnd despite my grades, I am a pretty bad programmer. I only know C++, Python, and Java, and I'm probably very rusty with the Java. I don't know Javascript, which I heard was important. I tried to watch videos on that last semester, and I ran out of steam at some point. I hear about all sorts of things you should know, like SQL, Node, React, MongoDB, Hadoop, etc, etc, etc, and I know exactly nothing about that. And I'm supposed to be going into Data Science, and I know nothing about that. I learned some random stuff about statistics, got As in the courses, but I've probably forgotten a lot of that and I don't know how to apply it anyways. And even with the languages I do know, my skills are rather poor, I am unfamiliar with so many things, and even with C++, my best language, if I had to rate myself on a scale of 1-10, I'd give myself at most a 3, being generous.\n\nI go to the job fairs for internships, but I'm probably just wasting my time. I have no experience whatsoever. I have no qualifications and am totally incompetent. My resume is just a list of my classes, and my cover letter is a copy of my resume because I have no experience and no stories to tell. I wrote down a list of common interview questions and wrote out answers to them and tried to memorize them over winter break, and I also looked up lists of common programming interview questions and tried to do them. It takes me several hours just to do a basic one and there are hundreds of them. Even if some recruiter gives me an interview by some miracle, I'm never going to get past any programming interview. I can't even remember C++ or Java syntax and such exactly at this point, and I have my current classes to study for. Are all of you grinding interview questions and reviewing old stuff on top of your classwork or something? I just don't think I can do it. And I pretty much have no friends, I never drink, I never party, I don't play video games during the school year, etc.  I don't even know what I'm going to do in the future. I'll probably try to get a job in a grocery store or something this summer, but our family has only one car, and my parents need it to drive into the city each morning for work, and I live in the suburbs, so it's not like I'll have a lot of options. Am I going to try for graduate school? I did take the GRE and got 169/169/5.0, but I heard those want you to have research experience and I have none, and I don't even know how I'd handle 10 hours of research on top of my classes anyways, and I have no interest in research, and I'm terrified of having to write a thesis of any kind.

We are pretty flexible with pricing and location but the apartment must be pet friendly. We have a Pomeranian and a cat, but they are kept inside our room by a baby gate and only allowed outside with our supervision.  \n\n\nSome examples of apartments we are considering/toured would be 520 N Neil st, ONE Illinois North Student Apartments, and 901 Western Apartments. We will definitely consider any ideas offered but these should give you a good baseline of the type of apartment we are looking for.  \n\n\nMy girlfriend and I can be a little messy sometimes but we are very clean people. For example, we shower everyday and regularly wash clothes, towels, bed sheets, and etc. I like to leave my dishes until the end of the day to wash but I will always rinse them first to get rid of any food before leaving them in the sink. You might see shoes or papers lying around in the shared areas sometimes but not anything than will create a bad odor. If you are a very clean person then we are perfectly happy to follow any rules you set, we've just been disgusted by how dirty and nasty our previous roommates have been. Neither of us use drugs, smoke, drink heavily, play loud music, or host parties so we are not that disruptive other than the dog barking a bit when someone enters or knocks on the apartment. We also would prefer the apartment to be on the slightly cooler side, so around 68\\*F to 73\\*F.  \n\n\nAs for things like hobbies and schedules, we generally keep to ourselves but can be very sociable with the right people. We are both night owls though and usually sleep around 2am. Some topics I like to talk about are games, computers, and cars while my girlfriend likes baking, kpop, and cute things like pusheen. We play a lot of games together so it would be great if you guys did too. Some games we play together are, Minecraft, Super Animal Royal, Overwatch, and League of Legends. I also enjoy games like Divinity Original Sin II and the Total War series. For those that want to know, I am Chinese while my girlfriend is Vietnamese but our native language is English. However, I can speak Mandarin fluently and she can do the same with Vietnamese so transfer students are perfectly fine with us too.  \n\n\nIf you're just a single person looking to share an apartment with us then just know that I am aware and understand you will be paying more for utilities than you should be so I am perfectly fine with you going shopping with me when I go and I will generally buy shared items like paper towels, water, and dish soap myself, however I won't directly give you money.  \n\n\nIf you are interested or want to ask some questions, please shoot me a DM.

Moore was a graduate of the class of 1948, earning a degree in music. For all four years at the university, he was a member of both the concert band and the university orchestra as a clarinetist. Not only that, he was quite involved with the Senior Memorial Chime. While an underclassman, he assisted two Senior Memorial Chimesmasters, both from his hometown, before succeeding his teachers as Chimesmaster in April 1948 (near the end of his sophomore year).\n\nIn an interview with the *Daily Illini*, Kenneth shared the story of his most difficult concert as Chimesmaster. During a concert in which a large audience watched him from inside the playing chamber, one of the transmission cables snapped in the middle of a song. He quickly ran up into the belfry of the tower, grabbed the snapped cable, and finished playing his concert by tugging on the ropes so that he could use the bell whose cable snapped.\n\nThe Senior Memorial Chime has inspired a strong sense of dedication and Illinois Loyalty for the last 100 years.

Illinois Human Resources and McKinley Health Center will be working with returning travelers to ensure compliance with the 14-day self-quarantine protocol.

For those traveling abroad during spring break, we urge you to monitor the CDC and State Department travel advisories, as the safety level of any given destination could change before or during your trip, making it difficult to return to campus by the March 23 resumption of classes. Please watch in the coming days and weeks for additional information on issues such as summer Study Abroad and other potential longer-term impacts of COVID-19.\n\nWe understand that the continued spread of the virus is generating concern and uncertainty for many.

We recognize that there can be financial and academic implications for students, and we are committed to working with them to the best of our ability to mitigate any negative impacts.\n\nWe are also taking several precautionary measures to ensure those returning to our campus from areas with COVID-19 exposure do not present any safety or health concerns for our community.\n\nStudents, faculty members and staff who are coming from countries under CDC travel advisories of Level 2 or 3 who choose to return to the campus to resume activities will be required to self-quarantine for 14 days. Illinois Human Resources and [McKinley Health Center](http://links.illinois.edu/f/a/C1gZ5sbWMsNqH88WsSNHmQ~~/AAMFlAA~/RgRgP-EBP0RBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWNraW5sZXkuaWxsaW5vaXMuZWR1L3VwZGF0ZWQtY29yb25hdmlydXMtaW5mb3JtYXRpb25XA3NwY0IKABwBXF1ehaAx5FIUanRhYWtpMkBpbGxpbm9pcy5lZHVYBAAAAAQ~) will be working with returning travelers to ensure compliance with the 14-day self-quarantine protocol. A full list of CDC travel advisories can be found [here](http://links.illinois.edu/f/a/rxdwuf1986R3u_c4ScV1Tg~~/AAMFlAA~/RgRgP-EBP0QkaHR0cHM6Ly93d3duYy5jZGMuZ292L3RyYXZlbC9ub3RpY2VzVwNzcGNCCgAcAVxdXoWgMeRSFGp0YWFraTJAaWxsaW5vaXMuZWR1WAQAAAAE).\n\nIt is also important to note that any individuals traveling to nations that are under CDC Levels 2 or 3 travel advisories during spring break also will be required to observe and prove this 14-day self-quarantine before being allowed to resume normal campus activities. For those traveling abroad during spring break, we urge you to monitor the CDC and State Department travel advisories, as the safety level of any given destination could change before or during your trip, making it difficult to return to campus by the March 23 resumption of classes. Please watch in the coming days and weeks for additional information on issues such as summer Study Abroad and other potential longer-term impacts of COVID-19.\n\nWe understand that the continued spread of the virus is generating concern and uncertainty for many. At this time, there are still no cases of COVID-19 in the Champaign-Urbana community. And we are continuing to work closely with state and local health officials on all medical issues and to implement precautions to help ensure the safety of all who live here.\n\nThank you all for your patience and understanding as we continue to make decisions and develop plans to protect our faculty members, staff and students on a constantly evolving issue.\n\nSincerely,\n\nRobert J.

Some other miscellaneous furniture is provided, I can double check exactly what if you're interested.

I\u2019ve already accepted at UIUC but wondering if that\u2019s the best option for me. I know it seems like a no brainer but hear me out. \n\nI\u2019m a much older student- I\u2019ll be 50 when I get my B.S. My major is psych. I applied to all\n3 schools, got a reply from UIUC first and accepted. Then the other acceptances came trickling in. I am from Chicago, currently living in the DeKalb area. I attended NIU a couple of semesters, it\u2019s a bad fit for me which is why I applied to other schools. \n\nThe reason I\u2019m rethinking this is because UIS psych program is 100% online. I wouldn\u2019t have to move which is expensive, also I have an 11 year old that I wouldn\u2019t have to uproot. However their psych program seems very basic. I\u2019m hoping to go into behavioral neuro and that does not seem to be an option there or at UIC. UIC is also local-ish...I would still have to move but only back toward the city, so &lt; 50 miles. It would be way cheaper and I\u2019d still be near my family. My mom is older and wants me near. \n\nWhat I\u2019m wondering is, at my age, is it really worth it to seek a specialization? Would any of the 3 school suffice if I just decide to finally get a degree for earning potential? I am definitely going to grad school, perhaps trying to go straight into a doctorate. Is that even realistic for me? I initially went back to school just to earn more money but got immediately swept up into how much fun school is, and how interesting, and just learning in general.

I have never been good at physics, so going into this course I was rather unenthusiastic about it. I didn't realize how much better PHYS 211 and 212 were in comparison to this class.\n\nFirst off, I am a person that was a very big fan of the flip it physics pre lecture videos. I can't really learn from lecture because I get really distracted by people in the lecture hall. But what does PHYS 214 do instead? Nothing! No videos in the physics budget! There are pre lecture readings, which can be helpful sometimes, but it's honestly just a lot of filler and not super great in my opinion. Fail.\n\nSecondly, my professor in lecture is not good at lecturing, at all. I had Stelzer for 212 and he's an icon and I loved going to lecture because... I actually learned! Wow, a concept! Instead, this semester I literally sit in lecture having to listen to the lecturer vaguely explain complex topics and be passive aggressive when ONE person talks in the fucking lecture hall. Like dude, I am not paying my high tuition to have you be pompous with us. Like, I came here to learn and you make this complex topic even more unbearable. RIP your ICES forms, my dude.\n\nThirdly, the grading is class is absurd. I understand that this is a half-semester course, but a 720/1000 is a D+? Are you kidding me? I have super awful testing anxiety and I bombed the (only) midterm and now I need an almost perfect score on the final to get a C-???? That's literally bullshit. I honestly do not understand why the UIUC Physics department is so unfair with their grading, like I am barely flying by even though I know the material and I study so much. I feel like they definitely set us up for failure. The times that I have brought this issue up to the professor, he would just push me towards tutoring and CARE. Like, no. Teach the class better and then we can talk. \n\nThe ONLY good part about this course are the TA's. Both my discussion and lab TA's are SO knowledgeable and helpful. I  have learned more from my TA's than the professor himself. God, they don't get paid enough to not only deal with a bunch of sections of undergrads that don't want to be there, but to listen to the professor too.  \n\nNow, I understand that the course was \"revamped\" within the last two years. I am not saying that the content itself is what's the problem, it's just the external issues that are the downfall for most students  in this course. The department should **seriously** fix this terrible grading scale. We are at the university and in the college of engineering for a reason, and this course makes me feel like a complete failure and that I don't belong here. I am doing so bad in it, and yet I regularly help my friends in this course and I do well on the homeworks and quizzes.

There are two specific issues on the voting ballot this year that I recommend you vote on.\n\nGoing in the order that they appear on the ballot, the first issue is that of our new mascot. As you may have seen, one of our students here on campus, and a really good friend of mine, has propose an idea for a mascot that I think would be amazing. For those of you who haven't seen it, the proposed new mascot is the belted Kingfisher, an orange, white, and blue bird that would take up the mantle of our mascot as we currently do not have one. I think this would be an amazing mascot to have, and if you would like more information about it, I recommend you Google it. The student in question has been interviewed by several different news sources around the area, and is also given their comments on it on this subreddit as well as on the Facebook page. Please go vote Yes for the Kingfisher.\n\nSecondly, there is a question on the ballot as to whether or not we believe that the University of Illinois should allocate more funding to the expansion and Improvement of the Counseling Center. You already know what you should vote on for that. Please go vote Yes, and vote that we want more counselors and unimproved Counseling Center here on campus.

Those of you who are voting against it for either of the two above reasons are either misinformed on the decision, racist, or both. \n\nThank you for attending my TED Talk.", "title": "STOP SPREADING LIES AND BS ABOUT THE NEW MASCOT"}, {"created_utc": 1583384082, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/fdq5is/stat_400_of_ha/", "id": "fdq5is", "is_self": true, "score": 1, "selftext": "Do you guys finish the exam 1 of Ha's section?

I firmly believe that the Chief is incredibly racist and belongs in our past.\n\nWith all the discussion about our potentially new mascot, I wanted to provide reasons why the Kingfisher is not a good fit for our university and why everyone should wait for another mascot proposal to come along. Here are my top three things we should keep in mind when we choose a mascot:\n\n1) The Kingfisher is not representative of the pillars of this university. In my first days as a student here, I was taught the four pillars of Illinois: TRADITION, PRIDE, EXCELLENCE, and LOYALTY. How does the Kingfisher embody any of these concepts? For a university that prides itself in its history, including these ideals, we need a mascot that can reflect that. The only thing the Kingfisher can commit to that is the fact that it is orange and blue.\n\n2) ALL student bodies of Illinois, former, present, and future, should have majority support for the mascot of this school. We cannot turn a blind eye to the alumni of this school, who greatly outnumber the people eligible to vote in this referendum, and choose a mascot that has little to no support with them. Sure, there will be some alumni that only want the return of Chief, which cannot happen, but we need a mascot that can bridge the divide. The Kingfisher is simply not that compromise.\n\n3) The \u201cFighting Illini\u201d name needs to stay intact. I know that as the proposal stands, the university would not stray from our current nickname. However, I think it\u2019s ignorant to think that, should the Kingfisher pass, future referendums would not attempt to change our name. Therefore, we should try to choose a mascot that embraces the idea of the \u201cFighting Illini\u201d so we don\u2019t chance losing that title. A predatory bird that is violent towards its prey does not capture that.\n\nThe above reasons make it clear that we need a better option. What do I think that option is? Currently, I believe that a redesign of Champ is the best idea that\u2019s come over the past few years. Champ maintains our fundamental ideals and the \u201cFighting Illini\u201d spirit, both in character and in relation to buildings on campus like Memorial Stadium. He also has fairly widespread support among current students and alumni who know we need a change. Nevertheless, the Kingfisher is not the change we can accept solely to fill the void where our next mascot will be.", "title": "Why You Should Vote Against the Kingfisher and Wait for Another Mascot"}, {"created_utc": 1583422291, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/fdwvhr/math_225_midterm_1/", "id": "fdwvhr", "is_self": true, "score": 1, "selftext": "I did worse on this midterm than I\u2019ve done on Calc 3 and 285 tests.

Full disclosure, I don't like the kingfisher (I just think its lame) and won't be voting for it. It seems like a much easier first step would be to commit to searching for a mascot and go from there. Getting 50% of the *student* population to agree on something like this is a herculean task.\n\nAnd this doesn't even take into account the university or alumni. Even if a referendum does pass, it's non-binding. And I'm sure the administration doesn't want to piss off all their generous donors, and to be honest, I don't see a reason for that either.\n\nIf you really want a mascot, call on the university to commit to finding an appropriate choice.

I figured that since this is a mainly engineering university that you would all understand that \"Oop\" refers to OOP (Object-oriented programming) and it was a pun on the word \"Ope.\" So you see now why a Midwestern engineer would say \"Oop\" instead of \"Ope,\" because it relates to engineering and sounds like \"Ope\"!\n\nA user, I will not mention their name, commented, \"It's spelled \"[ope](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Ope)\" thank you very much\" AND HAD THE AUDACITY TO LINK URBAN DICTIONARY DESCRIBING THE WORD \"OPE\" TO ME. OF COURSE I KNOW WHAT IT MEANS THAT'S WHY I'M MAKING THE JOKE! This user proceeded to get 16 upvotes... Karma that I SHOULD have gotten.\n\nFortunately another user who I appreciate very much simply stated \"abstraction\" (which is another coding term for all of you non-engineers that are apparently abundantly present).

I'm not mad at anyone, just disappointed that so many people did not understand an entry level engineering joke. I also wanted to make clear that YES I KNOW WHAT \"OPE\" MEANS. I feel slandered to have been put into this false light of not knowing basic Midwestern terminology. It made me feel like I did not belong...

No one cares if you post things or like things, that's really not what it's for at this point. \n\n1) If you don't have one you're likely missing invites to events. If someone is throwing a party with more than like 7 people they're not texting everyone individually, they're making a facebook event. It's very possible that you could be on that invite list but because you don't have an account, you don't get the invite and that sucks. \n\n2) Facebook messenger is a pretty universal app. A lot of people prefer it over GroupMe and text group chats. I'll often use it just to send pictures to my android friends because sometimes they don't go through with regular text. Also, if you need to contact someone for the first time and you don't have their number it's a pretty safe bet that you can find them on facebook and you'll be able to reach them over messenger. \n\n3) That's all on the facebook part, this one is just me saying it also might be worth getting yourself snapchat. If you meet someone cool in a class or at a party or whatever, it's way more casual to get their snapchat than their number. Also, just in the way it's formatted, you aren't expected to have full conversations on there which makes it a really nice way to ease into talking to someone. Snapchat also is a place where your friends might have groupchats and if you're without one you might be left out. \n\nThis isn't like an ad or something I just genuinely see people getting left out of things because they fail to have these 2 social networks.

He attended the University of Illinois, where he was heavily involved on campus. Each year, he was a member of the concert band and university orchestra. As a senior, he was elected president of Arepo, an honorary dramatic and music organization. He was known as a \u201cdrama extraordinaire\u201d and starred in several theatrical and radio shows, including \u201cThe Little Clay Cart,\u201d and \u201cCarmen.\u201d Most notably, Chuck was appointed Senior Memorial Chimesmaster by Prof. Josef Wright of the WILL radio station. As Chimesmaster, he played weekly Saturday evening concerts for the campus and had nearly all of them broadcasted on WILL. His claim to fame involves his partnership with Dewey Dawson, a graduate student organist. With the help of seven WILL recording staff, Chuck and Dewey broadcasted joint chime-organ concerts. Chuck graduated in 1936 with a degree in music but remained at the university as a graduate student for the 1936-37 academic year. By January 1937, he had apparently withdrawn from the university.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Chuck enlisted in the US Army on April 1, 1941 (prior to World War II) at Fort MacArthur, San Pedro, California. He was noted at the time of his enlistment as being a resident of Illinois, employed as a secretary, single, and without dependents. During World War II, he served as a second lieutenant, infantry, US Army (Service No. O-933310) before becoming a POW of the Japanese Army during the Philippines campaign. He was held at an unknown Japanese POW camp and eventually loaded onto the cargo ship [*Arisan Maru*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arisan_Maru). The ship was loaded with over 1,700 US POWs and about 100 civilians in the cargo holds.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;On October 24, 1944 at approximately 5:00 PM, the USS *Shark*, not knowing that American POWs were on board, fired three torpedoes at the *Arisan Maru*. The ship split into two before sinking around 7:40 PM. All on board survived the torpedoes; however, only nine POWs survived the sinking, which has been declared the largest loss of American lives in a single disaster at sea. Chuck was declared\u00a0\"Missing in Action\"\u00a0in the sinking of the *Arisan Maru* and was awarded the\u00a0Bronze Star Medal, Prisoner of War Medal, and the Purple Heart.\n\nThe Senior Memorial Chime is fortunate to still have Chuck's notebook, in which he hand wrote his musical arrangements. We have honored members of the United States military through memorial concerts on holidays such as Memorial Day, Labor Day, and Veteran's Day. These celebrations will be much more meaningful now that Chuck's life story and sacrifice for our country is known.", "title": "100 Years of Senior Memorial Chime History, Episode 5"}, {"created_utc": 1583852525, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/fgf577/ece402_finals_material/", "id": "fgf577", "is_self": true, "score": 1, "selftext": "As title, which lectures are going to be covered on the finals?", "title": "ECE402 Finals material"}, {"created_utc": 1583852610, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/fgf60w/8_week_course/", "id": "fgf60w", "is_self": true, "score": 1, "selftext": "As the title suggests, i need to pick up an 8 week course for the last 8 of this semester due to me dropping a class.

I have non U of I friends who go to Chicago all the time for work, family, etc. There will also be worried overprotective parents who will come down to visit because they won't otherwise get to see their kids over a semester. Or also truckers constantly using the Champaign area to stop, get fuel, etc. due to the 3 interstates that reach the city. The virus will likely get here at some point even if kids don't leave Champaign. And who's going to stop me or the hundreds of others every day from driving up to Chicago? Will the interstates be closed over spring break as well? How about Route 45? It's not really a question of stopping the virus from coming here but instead a question of stopping the virus from affecting a large chunk of the student body.\n\nCollege dorms and densely packed student apartments can spread viral diseases extremely easily. Even worse are lecture halls. One good sneeze can hit 10 people or more. Libraries, cafes, any study spots really is bad. Even dining halls are a huge danger. **There will be no good resources to quarantine large numbers of patients as there are in larger cities where most students are from.  Most students here have roommates so there is no self-quarantine option available and quarantine facilities must be reserved for those living in Champaign-Urbana without other options.**\n\nI haven't even started about the logistics of just moving the calendar up one week. Contracts with unions will have to be negotiated and signed. Employees with their own plans will have to cancel their plans. Businesses planning around spring break will have to reschedule. The University of Illinois basically runs Champaign-Urbana so changing the schedule will wreak havoc on many people, even those who aren't employed by the school. There's a reason schedules are drawn up years in advance.\n\nTl;dr: The only viable option is to empty the campus and cancel classes.

I taught English online with an app called Palfish. It pays $22/hr, and basically funded all my fun activities and dates/vacations. If you're interested, I posted some more details below along with my referral link (yes, I get a small bonus if you sign up, lol). Logged about 1300 hours on the app. \n\nA little bit about the schedule - it's entirely set by you. I worked mornings from 6am-9am, and sometimes evenings if I felt like it. You can close it at any time if you're feeling pressured by schoolwork. I made anywhere from $900-2000 per month depending on how many classes I taught. If you are skeptical, I can post screenshots of the payments. \n\nI figured, especially with this virus and some classes being cancelled/people staying inside, this info might be helpful to some people, especially if your family isn't funding your drunken tirades (or non-drunken tirades, in my case). \n\nMostly, it's playing with the kids while correcting their pronunciation. You're provided the lesson materials, so there's no prep work. You need stable internet and a phone/tablet, though. You don't need to know Chinese. You have to be a native English speaker from North America/Australia/NZ/UK/Ireland.\n\nYou can download the app here - I'll get a notification on my Palfish account and I will walk you through the process. (I get a bonus if you join using my link, full disclosure!).  By the way, if there's some kind of pop up, it's probably due to it being a Chinese web page.

Fortunately, there have been no confirmed cases among our faculty, staff and students. But such cases have been increasing in Illinois and our experts say early intervention is the best option to limit the spread.\n\nOur policies will adopt best practices endorsed by state and national health officials by minimizing face-to-face exposure in classrooms and other types of large gatherings, and by limiting international and domestic travel. They were developed with guidance from the leading-edge healthcare experts across our universities, who have been consulting daily with a leadership team composed of the president, the chancellors and the provosts from all three universities. We will continue to monitor the outbreak and stay in constant contact with the Governor\u2019s Office, the Illinois Department of Public Health, local health departments, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other universities around the state and the nation.\n\nThe new policies were carefully crafted to safeguard our students, faculty and staff without compromising the world-class education and the groundbreaking research discovery that are synonymous with the U of I System. They are:\n\nInstruction\n\nCourses at each of our three universities will immediately begin migrating to online or alternative delivery mechanisms to provide the social distancing that helps limit transmission of the virus, with a goal of completion by March 23. Classes will be held at their currently scheduled times.\nOnline and other alternative learning methods will continue until further notice, but our expectation is that it will be temporary and students will be updated regularly via email and updates on system and university websites.\nStudents have the option of studying remotely from home or from their campus residence after spring break.\nOur campuses will remain open and ready to serve students, including residence and dining halls.\nEach university will provide specific guidance for their students regarding both academic and housing arrangements.\nFaculty and staff will continue their work on campus, including research, and human resources offices will provide guidance for work conditions that foster safety and for employees who suspect exposure or infection and must self-quarantine.\nEvents\n\nEvents with more than 50 attendees that are university-sponsored or hosted by registered student organizations will be suspended indefinitely, effective Friday, March 13.\nEvents may occur via livestream or other telecommunications, or be postponed to a future date.\nPlease check with each university for specific guidance.\nTravel\n\nAll university-sponsored international travel is prohibited, along with non-essential domestic travel until further notice.\nPersonal international travel is strongly discouraged, and we urge caution and the exercise of good judgment for personal domestic travel.\nLeaders of our three universities will share further information for how these policies will be implemented to address the specific educational and safety needs of their campus communities. UI Hospital and clinics will provide additional protocols to address the unique needs in providing care for their patients.\n\nWe recognize the many challenges this will create for our students, faculty and staff. We pledge to do everything in our power to support you during this temporary move to safeguard your health and the health of people in the communities we call home.\n\nOur policies are rooted in our expert scientific knowledge base and exhibit an abundance of caution to take care of each other until the COVID-19 outbreak eases. We are all in this together, and appreciate your support and understanding.\n\nSincerely,\n\nTim Killeen, President, University of Illinois System\nBarbara J.

We know you have many questions, and although we don\u2019t have all the answers, we want to share with you some of the most critical information you will need to prepare for the coming days.\n\nUndergraduate students, remember that if you leave campus for break, take your computer, textbooks and other things you will need if you to choose study remotely in the coming days.\n\nGraduate students, we recognize that, in addition to taking traditional classes, many of you also participate in research, teaching, and scholarship as part of your responsibilities, and we are taking measures to support you in each of those areas.\n\nFaculty, your college and unit leadership have reached out to you to help prepare you to deliver your courses in alternative ways.\n\nStaff, we appreciate your efforts to ensure that we can continue to provide essential services to our university community throughout this unprecedented time.\n\nMany people across campus have been planning for several weeks to be prepared for this extraordinary situation. We have worked in concert with local emergency planners and the Champaign-Urbana Public Health District, as well as state and national public health officials.\n\nWe know the uncertainty of this situation is challenging for everyone in different ways. We have focused on what this decision will mean to you, and we are taking measures to mitigate the potential impact. Our goal is that you will be able to focus on your studies, your work, your wellness and your life, and we will provide the support and resources to protect you and our entire community.\n\nThe information below offers guidance on course delivery, travel and university-sponsored events and meetings. We also encourage you to visit [covid19.illinois.edu](https://covid19.illinois.edu/) for the most up-to-date information as we move forward.\n\nWe are confident that together we can continue to find innovative ways to address this and any other challenges we face, and we remind you to take care of yourself and to support each other in the coming weeks.\n\nSincerely,\n\nRobert J.

Cangellaris  \nVice Chancellor for Academic Affairs and Provost  \n\n\n**More Information on Course Delivery, Travel and University-Sponsored Events and Meetings**\n\n**Course Delivery**\n\nClasses will continue as normal through Friday, March 13. The campus will be suspending face-to-face course instruction after spring break. Face-to-face courses will be cancelled beginning March 23. Beginning as soon as possible after that date, most courses will be taught via alternative, online delivery approaches. Students are encouraged to consider staying at their permanent home. However, students who are unable to return home or who do not have adequate computer and internet access at home are welcome to return to campus. Courses already fully online will face no disruption and will continue as scheduled. Students with technology questions should contact Technology Services at [consult@illinois.edu](mailto:consult@illinois.edu) or +1-217-244-7000. Students who need accommodations or assistance with this transition should contact Disability Resources and Educational Services at +1-217-333-4603. Students involved in clinical training or clinical experiences should wait for guidance on what to do.\n\nWe will provide further updates as they become available.\n\n**For Faculty, Instructors and TAs**: Details will follow in a separate communication about support resources to help with the transition to alternative online course delivery. Instructors should work with their unit and college leadership to ensure appropriate continuity for their courses.\n\n**For Undergraduate Students**: If you are leaving campus for Spring Break, please make sure you have whatever computers and course materials you will need to continue with your courses remotely. You will be notified by your course instructors with instructions for how each course will be delivered. Please hold off on contacting faculty and advisors with questions until after you have received this information. Details about technical support for students will follow in separate communication.\n\n**For Graduate Students:** We recognize that graduate education frequently involves research and educational experiences outside of traditional classroom settings. For this reason, advice pertaining to graduate students will be developed separately in consultation with their academic program and the Graduate College.\n\nFor more information, visit [this FAQ](https://covid19.illinois.edu/frequently-asked-questions/).\n\n**Travel**\u00a0\n\nThe university is prohibiting all international travel on university-sponsored business for faculty, staff and students from March 16 until further notice. Those who believe they have an essential business reason to travel by air can request a waiver through their unit leader (dean, vice provost, vice chancellor, etc.), but the expectation is that such waivers will be rare.\n\nThe university has [cancelled all international Study Abroad](https://safetyabroad.illinois.edu/incident-response/updates/coronavirus.html) for all students from March 14 to at least August 15. The university will offer assistance to address academic and financial issues and other challenges that might arise from this decision. Study abroad educational experiences are life-long and life-changing; however, our top priority at this time is to ensure our students\u2019 personal health and safety while ensuring they can continue to make academic progress.\n\nThe university is limiting domestic travel for faculty, staff and students to pre-approved travel for essential university business. Those who believe they have an essential business reason to travel by air can request a waiver through their unit leader (dean, vice provost, vice chancellor, etc.), but the expectation is such waivers will be rare.\u00a0\n\nThe university is strongly advising against all international and domestic air travel on personal business for faculty, staff and students, especially those with underlying health conditions.\n\nAnyone who travels to a CDC Level 2 or 3 region, whether for professional or personal reasons, will be required to self-quarantine off-campus for 14 days BEFORE returning to campus. More information about [the Self-Quarantine Protocol can be found online](https://provost.illinois.edu/policies/policies/coronavirus/).\n\nFor more information, visit [this FAQ](https://covid19.illinois.edu/frequently-asked-questions/).\n\n**University-Sponsored Events and Meetings**\n\nThe university is suspending all university-sponsored, in-person events and meetings in campus facilities, effective March 13. More specifically, gatherings of 50 or more attendees should be postponed or cancelled. Instead, if possible and as appropriate, organizers should explore alternative ways of conducting the event, e.g., livestreaming and conference calling. Technology Services is increasing its capacity to support the necessary digital platforms and additional internet traffic. Resources will be limited, so please be thoughtful when identifying alternative options if possible.\n\nUniversity-sponsored events include events such as: colloquia, seminars, workshops, town halls and registered student organization events.\n\nAdditionally, the university strongly recommends that individuals with underlying health conditions not attend any meetings or events on campus. Those who believe they have an essential business reason to hold an event can request a waiver through their unit leader (dean, vice provost, vice chancellor, etc.), but the expectation is such waivers will be rare.\u00a0\n\nBeginning March 13, the university recommends that all in-person meetings be moved to an alternative solution unless meeting in-person is essential to do so. If so, please observe [CDC guidelines on social distancing and other preventative measures](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/index.html).\n\nFor more information, visit [this FAQ](https://covid19.illinois.edu/frequently-asked-questions/).", "title": "This Hour's Massmail - another one"}, {"created_utc": 1583981984, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/fh9n82/possibility_of_online_classes_for_whole_semester/", "id": "fh9n82", "is_self": true, "score": 1, "selftext": "What\u2019s the possibility?

[https://it.engineering.illinois.edu/keepteaching](https://it.engineering.illinois.edu/keepteaching) \n\nOne of the most important things you can do for online learning is to make sure your technology is functional.

Your instructors may choose Zoom or Skype (or potentially a 3rd option) to share and stream content with you, and each has a browser plugin of its own.

My main point is to avoid using software that students must download to their computer and can, instead, use in a web browser. This is desirable because it guarantees platform support anywhere that has a functional web browser (which is basically everywhere, and keep in mind that some students may want to use a computer that they can't install things on, such as in a public library). I hope that I can convince you of that, and provide useful advice regardless, in this post. \n\nAnother very important thing that I would like to mention is that Zoom, although it has nominal support for Linux, has really questionable support in practice. Last year, I had to do an online class that used Zoom, and it was a constant and never-ending string of issues, both for me and others (who were not on Linux), despite my best efforts to solve these issues. It would be *really* helpful to avoid using it for this reason alone, even putting aside my other concerns. \n\nFor lectures, there are a variety of options that work in a web browser (e.g. Twitch and Youtube streaming), thus eliminating the need for anyone to download anything, and guaranteeing that the software will work everywhere (e.g. Linux). The Free and Open Source [Open Broadcasting Software](https://obsproject.com/) can connect to these services very easily, and stream your computer's screen (e.g. for a powerpoint presentation), input from a webcam, or both at the same time (e.g. picture-in-picture). There are also alternatives to OBS, but they tend to cost some money. [Here](https://www.tomsguide.com/us/how-to-stream-to-twitch,news-21077.html) is a tutorial for how to stream to Twitch. Although these platforms and tools are usually used only for gaming, they have reliable and battle-tested infrastructure run by companies with massive infrastructure (Youtube owns Google, and Amazon owns Twitch) for streaming arbitrary videos, which makes them a great option for the current needs. One of my professors last semester held office hours on Twitch, for example (presumably just to make it more convenient for students).\n\nTheir main issue, however, is that these platforms make interaction somewhat more difficult since anyone who isn't doing the main stream needs to type their questions, etc. and send them. This isn't really an issue in most lectures, but, where more direct interaction is desired (e.g. office hours, discussion sections) than in a lecture, I would like to recommend two different tools: Discord, and Jami. Discord recently upped its maximum number of people in a conference call to 50 (with screen sharing, video chat, etc.), and it allows voice servers with an unlimited number of people to allow natural conversations to take place. Like Twitch and Youtube, their infrastructure is battle-tested (and cloud hosted, so it can expand to meet demand very quickly), and can be used in a web browser (native clients, including for mobile, exist too for those who prefer that). With Discord, you can quite easily setup a server and then share a link to students (e.g. via email), which then will work in a web browser. It also has great tools that will allow you to police the server (e.g. to remove someone who is causing trouble), and I have experience using it in my server of almost 1,000 people \u2014 it works well. Jami is a free and open source alternative to Skype. The features that it offers are very similar, but it has *much* better platform support (with first class clients for Windows, Mac, Linux, Android phones, IOS/Apple mobile devices, and Android TVs), and completely avoids any sort of centralized server altogether, thus eliminating any real concern about capacity for the added load. Jami is, however, a bit harder to use and lacks a web client, so Discord is probably the better option. I mention Jami just to have a backup in place in the unlikely scenario that Discord has issues.", "title": "To professors who are currently figuring out how to do online classes: *please* don't make me download and use questionable software (e.g. Zoom) (alternatives included)"}, {"created_utc": 1584054939, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/fhppgv/cwl_207_exam_1/", "id": "fhppgv", "is_self": true, "score": 1, "selftext": "If you're taking CWL 207 this spring 2020, can you tell me where should I go to get the answer for exam 1?

J.B. Pritzker temporarily closed the state\u2019s pre-kindergarten through 12th grade schools as part of ongoing efforts to curb the spread of COVID-19 in Illinois.\n\nAs you know, the University of Illinois System also took a proactive approach by migrating courses to online or alternative delivery mechanisms and by reducing large gatherings to create the social distancing that our scientific experts say is key to slowing the outbreak.\n\nAlthough primary and secondary schools will be closed, we want to remind you that our universities will remain open. Residence and dining halls will be open for students who chose to study from campus rather than home. In addition, many labs will be open for research, as will our hospital and clinics for patient care.\u00a0\n\nFaculty and staff will continue their work at our universities. We know that child-care issues will arise with the closing of pre-K through 12th grade classrooms, and employees should work with their supervisors to identify alternative work arrangements where appropriate. You will hear more in the coming days from your university\u2019s leadership with specific guidance on this matter.\u00a0\n\nTo date, we still have had no confirmed COVID-19 cases among our faculty, staff and students, and we will do everything in our power to limit the impact of the pandemic on our campuses going forward.\n\nThank you again for your understanding and flexibility. We recognize that this evolving situation is stressful and we encourage you all to take care of one another as we confront this public health crisis together.\n\nSincerely,\n\nTim\n\nTim Killeen, President, University of Illinois System\n\nAdditional resources:  \n[University of Illinois System](http://links.illinois.edu/f/a/VNS-S6bAuWCSEooKZOshJw~~/AAMFlAA~/RgRgTppaP0QlaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudWlsbGlub2lzLmVkdS9jb3JvbmF2aXJ1c1cDc3BjQgoAHVoVbF5laxMrUhNyZWFnYW5AaWxsaW5vaXMuZWR1WAQAAAAE)  \n[Urbana-Champaign](http://links.illinois.edu/f/a/Xlg2Qsm3KPAg_NomNi2jGw~~/AAMFlAA~/RgRgTppaP0QdaHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5LmlsbGlub2lzLmVkdS9XA3NwY0IKAB1aFWxeZWsTK1ITcmVhZ2FuQGlsbGlub2lzLmVkdVgEAAAABA~~)  \n[UIC](http://links.illinois.edu/f/a/0F_Zw3ZAYRIyFz3H6PrPcw~~/AAMFlAA~/RgRgTppaP0QhaHR0cHM6Ly90b2RheS51aWMuZWR1L2Nvcm9uYXZpcnVzVwNzcGNCCgAdWhVsXmVrEytSE3JlYWdhbkBpbGxpbm9pcy5lZHVYBAAAAAQ~)  \n[UIS](http://links.illinois.edu/f/a/uBENnXvHBUkOXxHWsT5WuA~~/AAMFlAA~/RgRgTppaP0QdaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudWlzLmVkdS9jb3ZpZC0xOS9XA3NwY0IKAB1aFWxeZWsTK1ITcmVhZ2FuQGlsbGlub2lzLmVkdVgEAAAABA~~)\n\n*This mailing approved by:*  \nOffice of the President   \n\n\n*sent to:*  \nEveryone", "title": "New Massmail @ 6:21PM 13 Mar. sez: \"To date, we still have had no confirmed COVID-19 cases among our faculty, staff and students, and we will do everything in our power to limit the impact of the pandemic on our campuses going forward.\" Full text below."}, {"created_utc": 1584150723, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/fib1rg/important_information_regarding_covid19/", "id": "fib1rg", "is_self": true, "score": 1, "selftext": "Nigga juice", "title": "Important information regarding COVID-19"}, {"created_utc": 1584150848, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/fib2r0/chem_102_hummel_exams/", "id": "fib2r0", "is_self": true, "score": 1, "selftext": "I took 102 last semester, and I\u2019m trying to find the old hour exams cause I\u2019m trying to show a friend.

For UIUC, my first major was CS+Stat and second major just Stat, but sadly I got into my second choice. If I go to UIUC, I certainly will change my major to CS+Stat.\n\nMy concern is this:\n\nI think UIUC has better reputation in computer science than Purdue, but I heard transferring to CS+X is very difficult. Especially, Data science is very hot now, so I believe it would be nearly impossible to get in. Also, I want the major title \"Data Science\" but UIUC just has \"Statistics and Computer Science\". This is not a big problem but it kinda uncomfortable with me. And the curriculum also, I compared the curriculums of those two, and Purdue was more optimized to real data science while UIUC seemed to be just CS and Stat jointed.\n\nREPUTATION, is important to me. I know Purdue is a great school for engineering and computer science but not as much as UIUC. Right? \n\nBecause I am international, I do not know exactly how much people appreciate Purdue and UIUC.\n\nWhich one is better? Going to Purdue for Data Science or going to UIUC for Stats and transfer to CS+Stat?

MTD is monitoring the situation closely through regular contact with the Champaign-Urbana Public Health District and Champaign County Emergency Management Agency, as well as other valued community partners, municipalities, and public officials.  \n\n\nMTD will begin providing free rides effective **Tuesday, March 17**. We encourage all passengers to limit non-essential travel. MTD recognizes there are some who serve in industries that must continue to operate as well as errands that must be run. MTD wants to eliminate any barriers to access and the free rides will apply to our fixed-routes, demand response services, and ADA Paratransit. Free rides also eliminates the need for our Operators and passengers to exchange cash, coin, and transfers.  \n\n\nMTD is currently operating our regularly scheduled service. [Reductions ](https://cumtd.us2.list-manage.com/track/click?u=5a377f81ec43c791d2b05d6f8&amp;id=90c44b0595&amp;e=2ec3a5308a)for the University of Illinois Spring Break are in effect Saturday, March 14 through Saturday March 21. At this time, MTD plans to resume full and regular service on Sunday, March 22. MTD is continuing to monitor ridership and our own employee availability to determine adequate and feasible service levels.  \n\n\nThis is a rapidly changing situation\u00a0and we will continue to update you through our [website](https://cumtd.us2.list-manage.com/track/click?u=5a377f81ec43c791d2b05d6f8&amp;id=cb1f0161a1&amp;e=2ec3a5308a) and on our social media channels.\u00a0  \n\n\nTo respond to precautions about being in public spaces, MTD has implemented a more robust [sanitation process](https://cumtd.us2.list-manage.com/track/click?u=5a377f81ec43c791d2b05d6f8&amp;id=f347ea48f9&amp;e=2ec3a5308a) for our fleet and facilities.  \n\n\nOur vehicles are cleaned every day, but as a precaution, we have introduced a deep cleaning procedure to disinfect our vehicles using electrostatic sprayers. The sprayers use medical-grade Husky 814 Q/T Tuberculocidal disinfectant solution ([EPA-Registered #1839-83 - Approved for Use Against COVID-19](https://cumtd.us2.list-manage.com/track/click?u=5a377f81ec43c791d2b05d6f8&amp;id=9c2a87357c&amp;e=2ec3a5308a)) to eliminate everything, from tuberculosis to coronaviruses, on treated surfaces. These sprayers emit the solution with a static electric charge, which allows it to adhere to everything, including cracks and crevices throughout the vehicle\u2019s interior.  \n\n\nMTD buses are currently being sanitized at least once a week; however, we are prepared to increase those efforts as needed. Vans for ADA Paratransit, C-CARTS, and DRES are on a more rigorous daily sanitation schedule because these services tend to transport vulnerable populations including elderly riders, people with weakened immune systems, and those with underlying health conditions.  \n\n\nWe have taken precautionary steps to protect our passengers and employees. We provided our frontline employees with individual bottles of hand sanitizer to use when soap and water are unavailable because hand washing is the first line of defense recommended by the CDC.  \n\n\n*In Service,*  \nKarl Gnadt  \nManaging Director/CEO\n\n===========\n\n*MTD will continue to follow the advice given by public health officials and we ask our passengers to do the same:*  \n\n\n**Protect Yourself**\n\n1. Clean your hands often - wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds especially after you have been in a public place, or after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing. If soap and water are not readily available, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Cover all surfaces of your hands and rub them together until they feel dry.\n2. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.\n3. Avoid close contact with people who are sick.\n4. Avoid handshakes, high fives, and hugging.\n\n**Protect Others**\n\n1. Stay home if you are sick, except to get medical care.\u00a0 \n\n* Call your doctor or nurse hotline to determine if in-person care is needed to avoid overwhelming our local health care facilities.\n* Cover coughs and sneezes.\n* Throw used tissues in the trash and wash your hands immediately after.\n* Wear a facemask\u00a0if you are sick.\n* If you are NOT sick: You do not need to wear a facemask. Facemasks may be in short supply and they should be saved for caregivers.\n\n**Clean and Disinfect**\n\n1. Clean AND disinfect frequently touched surfaces daily. This includes tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, faucets, and sinks.\n2. If surfaces are dirty, clean them: Use detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection.\n\n**Help Medical Personnel**\n\n1. Unless you are sick, you do not need to wear a facemask. Masks are in short supply and should be prioritized for caregivers, medical staff, and those who are sick.\n2. If you are sick, an initial phone consultation with your doctor\u2019s office may help prevent the spread of illness but also alleviate congestion in medical facilities.\u00a0\n3. While there is currently no vaccination against COVID-19, if you have not had a flu or pneumonia shot, you can still get one to protect yourself from other illnesses. Preventing the flu and pneumonia can help medical facilities avoid overcrowding.\n\n**Prepare Your Household**\n\n1. Refill prescription medications in case your household falls under quarantine. Call your doctor to see if a three-month prescription can be ordered.\n2. Prepare to stay in your home for two weeks or more, with critical items including food, hygiene items, over-the-counter medication, and pet supplies.\n3. Stay up to date with information and guidelines from public officials.\n\n**Resources**\n\n1.

So I know we're all reeling from the last email still--I'm a senior, and I've already had several dramatic crying sessions over it--but I've seen a couple of people posting about being bored/having nothing to do, and I thought I might make a list of some enriching ways we can pass the time. This sucks, there's no other way to put it, but if we can come out the other side having used all this alone time to learn a new skill or nurture a new interest, it will not have been entirely a time sink. The worst thing would be for us all to come out the other side of this having done nothing but coast in class and watch caustic YouTube reviews of movies we're never seen before or other unproductive things. Obviously it's good to rest sometimes, but I find sometimes the things that are too passive, like YouTube and Netflix, Reddit, other social media, can actually make me more stressed.\n\nSo a few things to do:\n\n* Do you have a skill you want to start using for freelance work? Finally make that website you've been planning to! There's a million platforms for this--I think Wordpress is the cheapest with the least ugly free URLs.\n* There are a million free apps in the app store that teach you coding. Why not learn the basics of HTML, CSS, etc?\n* If computer language isn't your thing, you can finally answer the call of the Duolingo owl. Start taking your target language seriously. Make a spotify playlist of songs in that language, and listen to it. Watch soap operas in that language. Practice making simple sentences. \n   * You can learn Ancient Greek for free [here](https://ancientgreek.pressbooks.com/) (my ancient Greek class uses this textbook!) and the basics of Middle Egyptian [here](http://www.egyptianhieroglyphs.net/egyptian-hieroglyphs/). \n* Through the UIUC library, you can stream HD productions of Shakespeare and Marlowe plays at the Globe Theater, for free. \n   * Productions from 2008-2015 are here: [http://www.library.illinois.edu/proxy/go.php?url=https://www.dramaonlinelibrary.com/series/shakespeares-globe-on-screen-2008-2015-iid-154834](http://www.library.illinois.edu/proxy/go.php?url=https://www.dramaonlinelibrary.com/series/shakespeares-globe-on-screen-2008-2015-iid-154834)\n   * productions from 2016-2018 are here:[http://www.library.illinois.edu/proxy/go.php?url=https://www.dramaonlinelibrary.com/series/shakespeares-globe-on-screen-2-2016-2018-iid-179726](http://www.library.illinois.edu/proxy/go.php?url=https://www.dramaonlinelibrary.com/series/shakespeares-globe-on-screen-2-2016-2018-iid-179726).\n* Learn about sustainability and zero waste (huge YouTube wormhole, ye be warned), and make a plan to implement some changes in your life. All the supply shortages lately have made me realize how many different products I have to restock, and often, but it turns out, you can make a lot of them yourself for a fraction of the cost (and with zero extra plastic packaging! sustainability is made out to be this high maintenance thing but it's actually simplified so much of my life and I've barely done half of what I plan to). \n   * Ex: I learned how to make my own translucent makeup powder, which means I don't have to pay $5 for a new plastic container of it every few weeks. Even if it just means growing a little bay leaf plant in your apartment instead of buying the leaves in the spice aisle, you can save *so much money* in the overwhelming amount of cases. \n   * Other things you can do: repurpose old t-shirts into rags (good for getting out your 'I'm paying all this money for glorified Khan Academy' rage), make your own vegetable stock using kitchen scraps, make your own laundry detergent (and make it smell like whatever you want...which means u can coordinate it to the undernotes in your perfume or cologne), plan out the biologically sustainable landscaping of your future house, make seed bombs ~~to throw at golfcourses with your friends when this is over~~, plan out the economics of getting solar panels, etc.\n* Learn to make bread from scratch. Also saves *tons* of money. And takes a ton of time sitting around. And takes multiple attempts to get right. The kneading is also good arm exercise.\n* Write letters or emails for Amnesty International! This is a really great way to do some good in the world at large right from your home. I know COVID19 is really scary, but there are so many other messed up human rights violations happening all over the world. You can choose what kinds of issues you write for (free speech, women's rights, LGBT rights, etc), and can do everything from signing a petition to writing handwritten letters. You can read more about it here:  [https://www.amnesty.org/en/get-involved/write-for-rights/](https://www.amnesty.org/en/get-involved/write-for-rights/) \n* Project Gutenberg:  [https://www.gutenberg.org/](https://www.gutenberg.org/)  and ZLib: [https://z-lib.org/](https://z-lib.org/)  offer free books, short stories, and articles. Now is a great time to educate yourself on that thing you've been meaning to educate yourself on (be it investing ~~\\[lol\\]~~, feminism, gay and lesbian studies, calligraphy, etc)\n* Start a melodramatic journal detailing your experience during this trying time (I always keep a melodramatic journal, but I'm an english major so)\n* Watch that snotty 3 hour film you've wanted to watch. And don't look at your phone while you do it. I guess this involves Netflix technically, but you know.\n\nReddit is starting to freak out so I think that's my cue to shut up. Again I'm not trying to make light of the situation as a whole, but I hope y'all can try to find a little bit of light in it. When you aren't supporting your loved ones, doing your work, or Skyping your friends, you deserve to do something wholesome that will leave you feeling good after. And *then* watch that YouTube rant review about the film you've never even seen. I'm so sorry this is happening right now.\n\nOh also, I know it's risky to be out and about, but **VOTE if you haven't already!!!** Ideally for someone that will make it illegal for big pharma to charge thousands for a vaccine when it comes out.", "title": "(Somewhat productive) ways to pass the time"}, {"created_utc": 1584404049, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/fjvh2h/the_university_is_suspending_all_facetoface/", "id": "fjvh2h", "is_self": true, "score": 1, "selftext": "Of course I'm hoping things will get better, but damn.", "title": "The university is suspending all face-to-face classes, everyone is staying inside, it's probably going to get worse, and now I'm wondering how I'm supposed to hang out with and say goodbye to all of my friends/classmates, professors, and coworkers before I graduate and move away... *cri*"}, {"created_utc": 1584405150, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/fjvr2p/dorms/", "id": "fjvr2p", "is_self": true, "score": 2, "selftext": "so according to the most recent email, do students who choose to stay on campus after break have to move to one of the dorms listed on the email (Bousfield, Nugent, Wassaja, Sherman, Daniels, and PAR)?\n\nThe email reads: \n\n\u201cResidents who are unable to move out of their permanent room by March 28 and require on-campus housing, may request Continued Housing.\n\nContinued Housing will be available in Bousfield, Nugent, Wassaja, Sherman, Daniels, and PAR.

The health and safety of our residents and employees is a top priority. We are actively following guidelines from the CDC, as well as other local and state organizations, and we will continue to monitor the situation. In an effort to practice social distancing we will be temporarily conducting all business via phone and email. Please give us a call at 217-352-3182 or email at leasing@ugroupcu.com and we will be happy to help you!\n\nWe are aware that the University of Illinois has suspended all face-to-face instruction for the rest of the Spring 2020 semester and that you recently received correspondence from the University regarding student housing which may be confusing to some of you. Please be advised that our apartments are not University Private Certified Housing and that the recent correspondence you received from the University relating to student housing does not apply to The University Group or any of our apartments. The University Group is a privately owned company that is not affiliated with the University of Illinois. Your lease with The University Group is a legally binding contract and will not be terminated prior to the end of its current term, so you will need to continue to make your rent payments as provided in your lease.\n\nIf you do not wish to remain in your apartment through the end of the lease term, or if you would like to avoid or reduce your rent obligations under the lease, then you may sublease to someone. We recommend advertising on our website https://ugroupcu.com/submit-your-sublease/, Craig's List, social media, etc. There are also good Facebook Groups like UIUC Apartment Hunters and roommate finding websites that are good for sublease advertising such as https://www.roommates.com/, https://www.roomster.com/, etc. Once you find someone to sublease the apartment we can easily sign a sublease agreement electronically, as long as we approve the subtenant in advance. The first step is for them to fill out the online rental application https://ugroupcu.com/rental-application-form/. If you cannot find a subtenant, you will need to continue to make your rent payments as provided in your lease.\n\nYou can easily pay rent online at https://ugroupcu.com/pay-rent-online/.  If you need to activate your online portal please contact leasing@ugroupcu.com. If you must pay with check or money order, please make sure your full name and full apartment building and address are on it and drop it through the night deposit drop slot located to the right of the front office door.\n\nIf you need to pick up a key, please call 217-352-3182 when you are in the parking lot and we will bring the key out to you.*\n\nSeems tone deaf to me.

J.B. Pritzker issued a stay-at-home order for residents of Illinois, part of the state\u2019s ongoing efforts to curb the spread of COVID-19. The order will be in effect through April 7 to keep people home as much as possible and minimize the person-to-person\u00a0contact that has fueled the global pandemic.\n\nBecause of actions we have taken to date, the governor\u2019s order is very consistent with what we are already doing. Faculty and students are transitioning to online and alternative learning mechanisms for the rest of the semester and many of our employees\u00a0are already working remotely. It has been a herculean effort and we are grateful to all members of our campus communities who have worked so hard to enact such a swift changeover. \u00a0\n\nGoing forward, we will add the following to comply with the\u00a0new order:\n\nEmployees\u00a0will work remotely other than those in essential jobs defined in the order, such as police, healthcare workers, power plant operators, and housing and dining personnel. Employees who have specific questions about whether this\u00a0announcement changes their current working arrangement should ask their supervisor.\n\nUnless in essential jobs,\u00a0faculty and staff\u00a0should stay at home except when pursuing essential activities related to healthcare, pharmacy and grocery shopping, gas stations, banking, drive-through and carry-out restaurants, and home-based\u00a0care for children and seniors.\n\nStudents, we are here for you and we are so proud of you! Please help us prevent transmission by staying in your residence halls, apartments, and permanent homes as much as possible while we clamp down on this virus. And use the technologies\u00a0that you are so good at to stay connected to our universities.\n\nNow, let\u2019s keep showing the way. Our healthcare professionals at UIC and across the state are on the front lines, caring for patients while addressing the epidemic. Faculty across our three universities are sharing their expertise with the Governor\u2019s Office,\u00a0including an Urbana-Champaign epidemiological study that demonstrates how heightened social distancing can slow the outbreak and prevent a shortage of intensive-care unit beds across the state. In fact, Gov. Pritzker has praised the U of I System\u2019s contributions,\u00a0which also include providing up-to-date research on the control of infectious diseases, emergency preparedness and public health.\n\nAll of you share the credit. Thank you for your concern and compassion for each other and for embracing our collective responsibility to curb the spread of the virus across this state that we are so proud to serve.\u00a0\n\nSincerely,\n\nTim Killeen, President, University of Illinois System\nBarb Wilson, Executive Vice President and VP for Academic Affairs, University of Illinois System\nRobert J.

Pritzker has issued a \u201cShelter in Place\u201d mandate beginning Saturday, March 21, 2020. This order will restrict all non-essential travel and business across the State. Residents will still be able to leave their homes to perform tasks essential to the health and safety of themselves and family members, including pets. This involves getting groceries and food items, gasoline, and obtaining healthcare services, including medical supplies, professional treatment, and medications. \n\nFor some people, public transportation is their only means to access these essential services. It would be devastating to those who rely on the Champaign-Urbana Mass Transit District (MTD) if our vehicles were not available to connect them to these critical needs. Many public services, such as Police, Fire, and Medical, have been deemed as \u201cessential services\u201d by the Governor, Public Health Districts, and the Department of Defense; public transportation is included as an essential service. MTD is honored to serve alongside other essential personnel in our community \u2013 to transport their employees, bring patients to their lifesaving appointments, provide access to prescriptions, and help families maintain access to food. All passengers riding the bus have a critical need to do so, and as public servants, we are proud to stand up and serve our community in this time of great need.\n\nOur ridership is down this week, which for the first time, we can celebrate as a victory. Fewer passengers allows more social distancing to keep everyone safe; this \u201cShelter in Place\u201d order will further aid efforts to reduce contact and limit service to essential travel. We ask that our riders maintain a safe distance from operators and other passengers by utilizing the entire space of the bus for seating and positioning themselves appropriately at bus stops and shelters.\n\nWe will continue to operate our [reduced service schedule](https://mtd.org/inside/mtd-pulse/non-university-of-illinois-service-reductions-continue-after-spring-break/) and address changing needs and circumstances as things evolve. Our services will remain fare free to eliminate the need for our passengers and Operators to exchange cash, coin, or transfers and also encourage social distancing by preventing crowding at the farebox. \n\nTo protect our passengers and Operators, MTD is positioning backup vehicles throughout our community to prevent crowding and allow social distancing on fixed-route buses, ADA Paratransit, and C-CARTS. Operators have been instructed to radio for additional vehicles if their passenger loads require more space. \n\nTo ensure capacity and social distancing opportunities are maximized, we will be employing the use of our large 60\u2019 articulated buses on popular routes to give our passengers more space, and 30\u2019 buses can be upgraded to 40\u2019 models when needed to ensure adequate space for passengers to spread out safely. An additional vehicle will be available for our SafeRides service to promote social distancing. SafeRides will continue to operate reduce hours - beginning at 7:00 pm and taking final trip requests at 12:00 am. We are also continuing our deep cleaning services with electrostatic sprayers to disinfect the buses.\n\nWe thank all of our passengers for their patience, support, and understanding.

The novel coronavirus or COVID-19 [threatens the health and lives of millions in this country](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/20/us/coronavirus-model-us-outbreak.html), as well as across the globe. With an inadequate response at the federal level, states are now rushing to handle the pandemic. Here at UIUC, *only two days before break* were we notified that classes were suspended, leaving many of us still scrambling to figure out future plans.\n\nStudents from across the country have formed the [National Intercollegiate COVID-19 Coalition](https://niccoalition.org/) in calling for their schools to pivot away from traditional grading scales, with organizers at **MIT, Columbia, and Duke** successfully petitioning for universal pass/fail. We at **No Fail UIUC** follow in the footsteps of our peers at Yale in **petitioning UIUC to switch to a universal pass grading system**, in order to mitigate the unequal impact COVID-19 will have on low income, neurodivergent, rural, international, and many other students. \n\nMany students will inevitably contract the virus. Some students will die. **All will struggle- and to what degree will be partially determined by how the school responds.**\n\nOur rationale is as follows:\n\nSuccess in education is determined not just by individual ability, but the resources available to a student- housing, food security, internet access, physical and mental health, etc. Being on campus with university resources acts as an equalizer, but due to current events, students will return home to wildly different circumstances that will determine how well they do on schoolwork and thus impact their futures.\n\nWith [millions of workers laid off](https://www.vox.com/2020/3/21/21188529/initial-unemployment-claims-goldman-sachs), students find themselves worried about their family\u2019s economic situation: whether they can afford schooling next year, whether they can pay rent or mortgages, or whether there\u2019ll even be food on the table. Many students are also expected to care for siblings whose K-12 education has been suspended. Others may be caring for family members who are at grave risk during this time, or may be immunocompromised themselves. **When the lives of yourself and your loved ones are in jeopardy, academics should be the last thing you have to be concerned about.**\n\nThose without consistent internet access are forced to venture out to libraries and other public spaces, endangering themselves and others- that is, *if* they haven\u2019t been closed already, leaving them unable to do their coursework\n\nStudents with anxiety, depression, ADHD, and other learning disabilities find themselves set adrift without academic or social support structures, struggling with overwhelming dread or distractions by the circumstances of a global health crisis without their counselors, friends, or disability resources to help them through it. \n\nOthers return to unstable home lives- neglect or abuse, even domestic violence- and are now trapped with abusive families by social isolation and stay-in-place orders.\n\nInternational students undergo unique stressors by nature of being isolated from their families here, or returning to unstable situations in their home countries. Those in different time zones find themselves unable to attend live lectures &amp; discussions unless they exhaust themselves by working into the late hours of the night, impacting their health and educational outcomes.\n\nThrough no fault of their own, **these students will get worse grades and/or fail classes, not only harming them in future job and graduate school applications in an uncertain economy, but potentially delaying their graduations and causing extra financial strain.**\n\nWhile some professors have already recognized these issues and have announced graciously flexible grading policies, they remain a minority. Even today, two days from the start of school, many have no updates from their professors on what to expect for the next half of the semester. While this is understandable, seeing as teaching staff have their own personal issues to deal with during this time, it highlights the fact that **we cannot place the expectation of equal treatment on individual professors and instead need a response at the institutional level.**\n\nUIUC has had a long standing commitment and history of equality in education. We call upon faculty and the administration to further honor this legacy, by:\n\n* **Switching to a Universal Pass system**\n* **Refunding tuition + fees to reflect the move to an online system**\n* **Subsidizing educational resources for disadvantaged students- laptops, internet access, software fees, etc.**\n\nAnd we ask you, fellow students, to \n\n1.

When two construction workers saw a poster of Asian candidates in the student union election, they muttered, \u201cVote corona.\u201d  \nBut now that the virus has firmly taken hold in Britain,\u00a0outmuscling the low-key measures taken by Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Chinese students are fretting for a different reason: \u201cPeople here haven\u2019t realized how serious this is,\u201d Ms. Zhou said. \u201cOver in China, there were a lot of control mechanisms in place, but not here yet.\u201d  \nThat wariness toward the way British universities have handled the outbreak could soon have huge financial implications. Universities in English-speaking countries, especially Britain, Australia and the United States, have grown increasingly dependent on tuition from Chinese students, a business model that the virus could dismantle.  \nADVERTISEMENT  \nContinue reading the main story  \nWith qualifying exams postponed, travel bans spreading and anger rising among Chinese students and parents at the West\u2019s permissive attitude toward public health, enrollment could plummet in the coming years, experts said, potentially leaving countries with multibillion- dollar holes in their universities\u2019 budgets.  \nAlready, analysts are talking about the prospect of government bailouts of higher education if Chinese students stay home, starving universities of the often-exorbitant overseas tuition fees that keep their less-profitable departments afloat.  \n\u201cIn quite a short period of time, we have become sort of addicted to one source of income,\u201d said Kerry Brown, a professor of Chinese studies at King\u2019s College London. \u201cIf the worst case happens and Chinese students don\u2019t want to come here in September, it\u2019s potentially a kind of seismic change.\u201d  \nIn Britain, some Chinese students are fuming that universities did not act more decisively to move classes online and scrap major events like spring balls. In interviews, they said they were weighing the health benefits of wearing a surgical mask with their fear of being racially abused or even attacked,\u00a0as a student from Singapore was last month in London.  \nNow that\u00a0China has seemingly corralled its outbreak, some students are even swallowing the cost of expensive plane tickets and rushing home.  \nADVERTISEMENT  \nContinue reading the main story  \nIn Australia, where the academic year began around the end of February, an entry ban on anyone who had recently been in China stranded tens of thousands of Chinese students at home. The outbreak has grown enough in Australia, though, that analysts fear the next travel ban will be imposed by the Chinese, with the government potentially asking students not to travel to virus-prone countries for schooling.  \nAnd in the United States,\u00a0swift shutdowns\u00a0left international students without any help as they packed up and tried to find affordable flights home.  \nTaken together, those slights and miscalculations have dented the reputation of overseas universities in China, analysts said. American universities were already hurt by trade tensions between Washington and Beijing and new visa restrictions on Chinese graduates. And British universities, too, are dealing with uncertainty over European Union research money and student-exchange programs after Brexit.  \nUniversity administrators are bracing for parents already wary of the risks of global travel in the age of the virus to decide it is no longer worth shelling out tens of thousands of dollars for an overseas degree.  \n\u201cI think this is going to exacerbate the sense that has been growing for years that the U.K., and to a lesser extent the U.S., are not great destinations for international students, especially Chinese students,\u201d said Craig Calhoun, a professor of social sciences at Arizona State University and a former director of the London School of Economics and Political Science. \u201cApplications and acceptances could go down precipitously, and I think very few U.K. universities have planned for that.\u201d  \nIn Britain, universities began chasing after Chinese students amid declining government funding, combined with a move by Indian students to enroll in American schools instead. Last year, more than 120,000 Chinese students enrolled in Britain, with some major universities\u2019 student bodies now a fifth Chinese.  \nADVERTISEMENT  \nContinue reading the main story  \nConservative estimates put their combined fees at about 1.5 billion pounds, about $1.75 billion. Many enroll in postgraduate business and finance programs that are the universities\u2019 biggest moneymakers.  \n\u201cIf enrollment falls by a quarter, that\u2019s a huge amount of money and, for some universities, the difference between bankruptcy and staying afloat,\u201d Professor Brown said.  \nAlmost 400,000 Chinese students\u00a0were studying in American universities last year. Australia has become even more reliant on Chinese recruitment: With 200,000 Chinese students, it stood to lose about $4 billion, by some estimates, had the coronavirus-related travel ban kept them from attending the first term.  \n\u201cIn Australia and New Zealand, the approach has been to treat international students as cash cows, and as a result the shortcomings in their systems are really coming to the surface,\u201d said Salvatore Babones, an associate professor at the University of Sydney and an adjunct scholar at the Center for Independent Studies. \u201cWe\u2019re essentially just running an offshore university experience at the master\u2019s level.\u201d  \nChina, desperate to fill universities hollowed out under the one-child policy, has lately improved the quality of its own higher education system, tempting some students to stay home. British university administrators now fear that those changes, combined with China\u2019s success in battling the coronavirus, could make the case for an overseas education more difficult.  \nZhexuan Lu, a second-year student in sports management at the University of Bath, said he was surprised to find the British government ignoring the virus when the spring term started in January.  \nADVERTISEMENT  \nContinue reading the main story  \nFew countries have since charted such a different course from China than Britain, which initially hesitated to shut restaurants and pubs. China, by contrast, has reported reducing its new local cases to zero by heavily curtailing people\u2019s movements.  \nAs the president of the Bath Chinese Students and Scholars Association, Mr. Lu sent a letter to the university\u2019s vice chancellor asking for more lectures and course notes to be made available online. But he said the university was reluctant to do more until there was a confirmed case of the virus on campus.  \n\u201cNobody worried about it except Chinese students, because Chinese students know what happened and what helped in our home country,\u201d Mr. Lu said.  \nNevertheless, Mr. Lu said that younger Chinese students applying to British universities would not be deterred by the way Britain responded to the coronavirus, saying the virus would pass.  \nShould it remain a threat for longer, though, Professor Babones said, there was a risk that China would reciprocate other countries\u2019 travel bans by considering asking its students not to go abroad for their studies, fearing that they would bring the virus back from a country where it was more rampant.  \n\u201cIt\u2019d be a big propaganda win,\u201d he said. \u201cYou kept our students out? Now we\u2019re pulling them out.\u201d  \nSome British universities are considering offering preterm English courses online and allowing Chinese students to delay their enrollments until January next year. Some have also tried to diversify their international student body in recent years, though analysts warned that was unlikely to compensate for any financial losses from China.  \nADVERTISEMENT  \nContinue reading the main story  \nWhile Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union will pile pressure on its universities, the government has said it will extend the visas of international students as a way of persuading them to stay.  \nIn some ways, British universities\u2019 response to the virus reflects\u00a0the muddled messages coming from the prime minister\u2019s office,\u00a0which has been reluctant to impose any mandates and slow to discourage large gatherings.  \nIn one email that upset students at the University of Cambridge, administrators insisted that the business school would hold exams last week in rooms of up to 40 people, despite students\u2019 fear of the crowds. The university said it and its colleges were \u201cdoing all in their power to prepare students and staff for unforeseeable circumstances.\u201d  \nFor Ms. Zhou, the postgraduate officer in the student union at the University of Bath, being in Britain during the time of the virus meant fielding worried phone calls from her mother.  \nIt has also meant trying to adjust to the more relaxed views of others, like a man to whom she tried to sell a concert ticket after she decided the virus made it too dangerous to go.  \n\u201cHe was, like, \u2018It\u2019s just the media going crazy,\u2019\u201d Ms. Zhou said. \u201cHe encouraged me to go and have a fantastic time.\u201d", "title": "NYT Article Text"}, {"created_utc": 1584844137, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/fms8fk/dorm_mail/", "id": "fms8fk", "is_self": true, "score": 1, "selftext": "So....

I'm going to be posting here to keep you as up to date as we can. I'll update/edit as new information becomes available. I'll put dates on edits so that it's obvious when they happened. \n\n**Are we open? -** No. Due to the Stay At Home order issued by the Illinois Government, we closed at 6p on 3/20 and we stay closed until we have authorization to re-open. \n\n**Will you re-open and when? -** We certainly hope so and soon. The stay at home order currently lasts until 4/7 so at least until then. Also, we will probably be looking for student staff. So if you are looking for now, the summer or even next Fall you can apply [here](https://union.illinois.edu/about/employment/student-employment)\n\n**Can I order on-line from you? -** Currently, unless you are ordering digital content, not until we re-open. For physical items, you can place an order and we will process it as soon as we re-open. \n\n**What about my rental book? -** Unfortunately, we do not yet have a plan for that. We are going to be as lenient as possible and will send out updates here, from our email, on our website and through all of our social media accounts as soon as we have an answer.\n\n**How can I contact you? -** No one is at the store right now but all of our regular channels still work and are being monitor regularly. You can leave a voicemail at 217-333-2050 an email at [iubstore@illinois.edu](mailto:iubstore@illinois.edu) or you can contact me directly at [jmtrail@illinois.edu](mailto:jmtrail@illinois.edu)\n\n**What about  (I-Card, Amazon,Starbucks)? -** The University closed the building so all of our partners are closed as well.

Please share these resources with your students often and encourage them to use them.\u00a0\n\nAs you begin to navigate these unprecedented last few weeks of the semester, we hope you will also continue to monitor your own wellbeing and to utilize the support resources available to you as faculty and staff members:\n\n**COVID-19 Campus Wellbeing Services**\n\nIllinois Campus Wellbeing Services has created a\u00a0[Coping with COVID-19 Toolkit](http://links.illinois.edu/f/a/i0Fj559q5TJv1Oq14XkTNQ~~/AAMFlAA~/RgRgW6IoP0RraHR0cHM6Ly9odW1hbnJlc291cmNlcy5pbGxpbm9pcy5lZHUvY2FtcHVzLXdlbGxiZWluZy1zZXJ2aWNlcy9yZXNvdXJjZXMvb25saW5lLXRvb2xraXRzL2NvcGluZy1DT1ZJRDE5Lmh0bWxXA3NwY0IKAB8oHXleJmpMwlITcmVhZ2FuQGlsbGlub2lzLmVkdVgEAAAABA~~). It includes a variety of self-care resources.\u00a0\n\n**Faculty/Staff Assistance Services**\n\nFaculty/Staff Assistance Services (FSAS) is continuing to provide services by shifting to phone and virtual services. FSAS remains available to address any urgent needs and concerns. Please feel free to contact them at\u00a0[fsas@illinois.edu](mailto:fsas@illinois.edu)\u00a0or 217-244-5312 during standard business hours of Monday through Friday, 8:00 AM \u2013 5:00 PM.\n\n**Community Telehealth Therapists**\n\nWe also have a list of therapists in the community providing telehealth services and FSAS can facilitate those referrals. Please contact\u00a0[fsas@illinois.edu](mailto:fsas@illinois.edu)\u00a0if you are interested in more information about those services.\n\n**Rosecrance**  \nWe have a partnership with Rosecrance, a local mental health treatment center. For more information, please contact 217-328-4500. They also operate a 24-hour emergency crisis line at 217-359-4141.\n\nFinally, we want to be clear, all of you are valued members of our university community. It is distressing to hear racist and xenophobic language being used in national discourse about the COVID-19 pandemic.

Recently I have been increasingly interested in pursuing computer science, and I would really like to at least try it out. Having little experience in the field, I was admitted at UIUC with a different major, and I have no intention of trying to switch into the major, as I know it's nearly impossible.\n\nI've been thinking I will choose not to go to UIUC, and instead attend a school where I can major in CS, such as MSU. However, I recently received the idea of pursuing a CS minor as well as a data science certificate at UIUC, while majoring in something related. This would give me experience in the CS field as well as something to show for it. Though it appears that many people in the field regard both as sort of meaningless, which I could understand. It seems like the most valuable thing outside of a degree in CS is experience with projects done outside of class.\n\nAdditionally, I think I would be most motivated and happy at UIUC, overall, and I'm not even sure if CS is for me yet.\n\nMy question: Is there any known paths at UIUC alternative to majoring in CS that could still put me on a path to becoming an analyst or a developer if I really put in the work?

The following modifications to the CR/NC grading will be in effect for the Spring 2020 semester only.\n\nYou have until April 30, 2020, to elect CR/NC grading.\n\nCourses taken with CR/NC may be used to fulfill major, minor and General Education requirements.\n\nThere is no limit on the number of courses selected for CR/NC.\n\nFor a small number of courses that must significantly alter their assessment strategy, instructors may request a switch away from standard course grading (A/B/C/D/F) to \u201cpass/no-pass\u201d (PA/NP) grading for their course. This option is only anticipated for\u00a0courses where the assessment modification makes it difficult to fairly assign letter grades.\n\nIf a course is approved for PA/NP grading, all students will be assessed using the same pass/no-pass criteria. There is no option for students to select standard grading.\n\nYour instructor will let you know in the near future if your course is converted to PA/NP grading.\n\nDeadlines for student actions:\n\nThe deadline to drop a full semester course (without a W) is now April 30.\n\nThe deadline to select CR/NC grading is now April 30 (see above).\n\nThe deadline to utilize Campus Grade Replacement option is now April 30. Students who previously selected a course for grade replacement may now retract their prior request.\n\nOther important dates for continuing students:\n\nTime-tickets for Summer 2020 and Fall 2020 registration will be released on April 6.\n\nRegistration for Summer 2020 will begin on April 20.\n\nRegistration for Fall 2020 will begin on April 20.\n\nStudents and courses in professional programs (College of Law, Carle Illinois College of Medicine and the College of Veterinary Medicine) are excluded from these temporary academic policy modifications.\n\nColleges and departments have agreed to work with those of you who were expecting or require graded courses for career or certification purposes. We promise CR/NC and PA/NP grading will not affect your status as a student at Illinois.\u00a0\n\nWe are seeing a growing number of our peer institutions implementing similar policies for this semester, and we expect external stakeholders (e.g., graduate schools, employers) to recognize the unique nature of this semester. We are extending these deadlines\u00a0to give you more time to make informed choices to try to lessen your stress.\n\nIf you do not have proper technology equipment to continue your studies remotely, please contact the\u00a0Student Assistance Center\u00a0in the Office of the Dean of Students right away. They can work to supply you with internet access, laptops, hardware and anything else you might need.\n\nI know this adjustment to our policies is neither ideal nor is it a course of action we would ever consider in any normal circumstances. But, in this unprecedented time, we believe these actions are the best way to deliver an educational experience that\u00a0is fair and academically sound.\n\nSincerely,\n\nAndreas C.

However, I believe the deadline they have chosen is not the best given the situation. I think the deadline should be after final grades are released for the following reasons:\n\n\\- The incentive structure to study for and perform well in finals is broken. I am sure there will be a bunch of students who have already reached the minimum grade they need to get credit before the final. Since many students will have converted their courses to CR/NC by April 30th just to not have the stress of finals, they have no incentive to study for or do well in their finals (even if they do end up getting a high grade in the class they can't swap back to a normal grade structure).\n\n\\- For classes that have group projects, this situation is even worse. If there are some members of the group who have already chosen to convert the course to CR/NC, they will likely not put nearly as much effort into the project as they would have otherwise. This will force group members still following the normal grading structure to either do more work than they were supposed to in order to pick up the slack or just accept a lower grade for the project. If the deadline was after final grades, there would be more students who would still have the incentive to keep working through the project.\n\n\\- Having the deadline on April 30th just adds another deadline for students to stress about.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am aware that regardless of when the deadline is there will still be several students who chose to just convert all of their courses to CR/NC, just to avoid the stress / avoid having to do all the work.

Some things that are important in my decision:\n\n* Cost is a non-factor in my decision as all cost similarly.\n* Weather/location is also something I don't care about. \n* I understand that outcomes in terms of jobs/internships/etc. are roughly the same, and that ranking-wise they are all pretty much equal.\n* However, there may be a slight difference in the schools when it comes to non-CS subjects. I'm also looking to study mathematics and statistics, so the departmental strength of these fields are also important. \n* I have an interest in either pursuing academia/research in math/CS or quant finance, so the relative opportunities for those two fields is an important factor. However, the differences between the schools will be pretty marginal as well (I think?). Location can possibly play a role since UIUC and Michigan may attract Chicago trading firms, but I'm not sure if this is that significant.\n\nBased on what I've thought about above, I feel like the best choice university to attend will be the one based on soft factors like culture, community, etc. (unless I'm wrong on this conclusion). However, because the current pandemic has left all physical campus visits to be cancelled, it's been hard to judge each school based on these factors.

If you wrote a paper with a co-author, then you\u2019d each get half a point. If you wrote a paper that\u00a0*doesn\u2019t* appear in a top conference, you get zero points. Your institution gets the sum-total of all the points its researchers receive.\n\nEven if you are interested in a research career, though, the number of publications doesn't speak to the professors' ability to mentor, teach, and shepherd an undergrad. A professor who publishes 4 articles a year might actually be better at that than a professor who publishes 8\".\n\nI am a committed CS major at UIUC, but this honestly leads me to think that subject rankings on CSRankings have the potential to be really skewed.

Because the thing is this. People are capable of blind hatred yes. But when there is a living, breathing human being right in front of them that's doing no wrong, it is so much harder. People stop.

The course has a very large enrollment. The logistic challenges of scale coupled with students having access to varied resources, will make designing assessments that are fair and equitable, impossible. *\n\n*Dispersed Students. Students are now dispersed in different geographically locations. This makes it challenging to ensure that all students equal access to the instructional staff due to time differences. In addition, some students have limited internet access. This makes it difficult to have a fair evaluation of all students.\n\n*Proctoring Challenges. The course relies on proctored exams and quizzes. Relying on the Proctor IO infrastructure is a major concern because it is internet based, and with increased load on the internet and inequitable access to internet, this could cause major challenges. In particular, this may result in a number of students being wrongly accused of cheating, when there are breaks in the internet connection. Such wrong accusations will cause increased anxiety among students and will increase faculty and TA workload because they would need to review those cases. *\n\nSynchronous Paper-Based Assessments. Paper-based synchronous tests are relied upon because students in the course are tested on their ability to write mathematical proofs. Synchronous testing is necessary because there is a small pool of questions at the right level, and moving to asynchronous testing will either make the tests very hard, or allow students taking the test later to have an unfair advantage. Further, it is difficult to provide an online testing environment as there is no adequate computer-based method for students to enter mathematics that does not have a significant time overhead which will lead to stress in a test environment. Synchronous testing is not fair and equitable to all students due to their location in different time-zones and differing resources. *", "title": "CS is not switching to mandatory Pass/Fail"}, {"created_utc": 1585785318, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/ftbmsm/what_to_do_with_yard_waste/", "id": "ftbmsm", "is_self": true, "score": 1, "selftext": "I saw city of champaign postponed pickup indefinitely.

Participants will receive a $10 Amazon gift card after completing the study.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in signing up or would like to learn more, please visit this form: [https://forms.gle/rSgAC8AtKQ8zp23M9](https://forms.gle/rSgAC8AtKQ8zp23M9).\n\nRegardless, hope you all are doing ok during these stressful times and good luck to everyone!\n\nThank you!\n\nUniversity of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign\n\nIRB#20637", "title": "[Update: compensation included] How do you evaluate each other in group projects?

Basically I was raised with a lot of space and cleanliness. My older bro who went to uiuc stayed in Illini tower which my parents liked because he shared a bathroom with total 4 guys. My mom keeps getting mad saying that im gonna get cold, flu, diseases (and STDS!!) from a communal bathroom shared w/ everyone. She thinks its gross and unhygienic and also that dorms are such small places and if my roommate is sick ill get sick because we\u2019re in such close proximity. Shes like \u201chow are you gonna sanitize everytime u use the bathroom?!\u201d I really dont want private housing because i want the traditional college freshman typa feel (socially) and overall dorms are convenient bc you can eat wherever. That stuff is more important to me than having a nice bathroom and its my college experience. Id obviously take basic precautions (sanitize things often if roomie is sick, cover cough/sneeze, wear shower slippers, toilet seat covers etc.). At the end of the day im the one staying here. So any advice that i can tell my mom? My parents are the one paying for this after all and although theyre willing to pay more money for private housing for my \u201csafety\u201d i still have to be respectful of the fact that theyre paying for all this.

After reading this, I had an \"oh shit\" moment where I couldn't remember if I included an incident in my application or not. Basically, what happened was I got caught with alcohol at school back in December (I'm stupid, I know), a couple weeks before the regular decision deadline for UIUC. I wasn't drunk or anything so I ended up getting away with just a one-day suspension.\n\nAfter reading the policy on the acceptance page, I went back into my application to see what I had written in the disciplinary actions section and, as I feared, I completely fucked up and forgot to change my application to reflect this in the disciplinary actions section of the application after this happened. Looking back, it was since I already filled out everything and reviewed it before this happened as all I had to do was finish my essays (I know I definitely should've looked back at everything again, but hindsight is 20/20). I have one other incident on my record from my junior year where I used inappropriate language that some kid overheard and got offended over which got me suspended for a day and that was on the application so it's not like I was trying to cover things up.\n\nI just wrote up an email to send to them that explains my mistake more in-depth than this along with talking about the situation that happened at school, answering everything they ask for in that section of the application.\n\nBasically, has anyone else been in this situation where they failed to provide a disciplinary action in their application and have insight as to how they would handle this? If not, at least had an issue in school such as this after their application was already accepted and know how they generally look at this kind of incident? I know the falsification and/or concealment of information of your application is serious stuff, but this was a straight-up mistake in my application that I'm 100% willing to own up to. If I'm upfront about it, do you guys think I'll be good and still be able to be admitted to UIUC?\n\nAlso, if this matters, as far as my grades go, I've done well in school prior to and after the incident (I actually have the best grades I've had in my four years of high school during this semester so far, all A's and one B.

Later, I realized from talking to students from other Universities, that the problems are present in most of the largest Universities in the USA.\n\n&gt;Every semester students face the same problem; having to arrive at school 30 minutes to one hour earlier just to be able to have time to find a parking spot. It is a real hassle being able to find a parking spot and it becomes frustrating and stressful. \n\nA group of friends and I decided to continue with the idea and commit to solving the problem. So, to help us better build a solution for the students and the schools, we are asking students at various Universities a few questions about their experience when parking at your university campus.

The JSM gym location is also right below the apartment and you'll have full access to that. JSM has informed me that once I find someone, I can either have my security deposit of $1,105 returned to me after 30 days, or I can gift it to the new resident.

From the top, all the way out on the arm, sitting, straddling the bars on the end, I had the best view of campus I had ever seen in person or on photos. The UGL was just below me, as was the South Quad (McFarland) Belltower, and well, everything else because cranes are fucking tall. I was hooked like drugs.\n\n[Where it began](https://preview.redd.it/vtmjnf0qzes41.jpg?width=1512&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6c8c5e5a61f5652af060243e4b16920034049d40)\n\nMeat Science Lab Radio Tower by PAR\n\nAn easy climb \u2013 over the wall behind the building, onto a low roof which holds the tower, and using pegs on the sides of the tower to climb to platforms at the top.\n\nCrane #2 Midtown Lofts\n\nIt didn\u2019t feel that high up thanks to the rooftop of the construction underneath me, but it was a trickier climb since the ladder on the crane was not enclosed and didn\u2019t have intermittent landings. There was a cart/elevator thing on it halfway up, which I had to climb around and into in order to continue, which gave me a nice place to sit and break. During this, my wallet fell out of my pocket and I had to run back to get it from the base of the crane a few hours later. I remember seeing cops drive past me on the street and thinking how odd it is that nobody ever looks up. Once out on the arm, I copped this beautiful photo:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hxt7r13tzes41.jpg?width=1512&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=589c1059d7cc2d240cc383b7049297bae1412743\n\nNuclear Physics Building\n\nThere is scaffolding around some exhaust pipes on the south side of the building, and ladders on the rooftop to reach various levels.\n\nECE Building\n\nAfter hopping up on a little glass overhang above a door on the Southeast corner, myself and another person used the louvers to climb the fa\u00e7ade like a ladder. I climbed down; my compatriot literally walked into the building from the roof and took the elevator down.\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/fzzzlb/video/l4i2d9n10fs41/player\n\nThe Armory\n\nMy favorite climb. I had been planning this one for awhile, though it happened randomly after chapter one night. I was walking around the building, and thought the time was right. The middle doors are framed by concrete bricks that go all the way up to the top of the wall. These bricks alternate: flat, sloped, flat, etc. meaning that only every other block is a good handhold. Once I topped this wall, I walked along the lower roof towards the east side. Near the end are circular windows that are framed with concrete block; using those, I got a bit of height above the roof, reached up and around the next parapet, hanging backwards for a moment, then I found myself at the base of the arched roof. From here, there are 3\u201d wide supports spaced 8\u2019 apart that make a stretched-out ladder. The first few were hard for me and I had to jump, but as the roof curves, eventually I was able to stand up and walk to the top to enjoy a 360 degree view in the middle of Campustown. On the way down, just as I started downclimbing the big doors, a couple walked past, saw me, stopped, seeming very confused. when my feet hit the ground one of them asked me if I was Spiderman. Disclaimer: do not try. I was thankful for my years of bouldering experience and for my and approach shoes here.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v9qawt7xzes41.jpg?width=2016&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2057a3529be419b241b4ee51967a300a56a52a37\n\nMcFarland Belltower\n\nThis climb I fucked up, hard. As in, falling 25 feet, breaking both heels, my left thumb, as well as getting a 10 percent compression fracture in my L3 vertebrae, bad. Given the height of my fall, I\u2019m lucky to be walking now, and alive at all.\n\nThe tower has platforms every 25 feet. Between them are ladders. However, there are no ladders up to the first platform. The walls are sheer and brick; no handholds to be found. I had to chimney; that is, use both legs and both arms pushing against opposite walls, like that one challenge in American Ninja Warrior, and shuffling upwards. I had done this before, but never with walls that were so far apart. I made it to the first platform, was unable to remove either of my hands to grab onto it, started to downclimb, felt myself weakening, and decided to let go and fall of my own accord rather than slipping and probably losing control and maybe dying. I feel that this decision, although difficult, probably saved my life. I fell straight onto the concrete, legs buckling beneath me, breaking lots in the process. I then called 911 myself. I finished my semester from home (thanks, UIUC, for letting me do that), paid my time in a wheelchair, and am still recovering physically and mentally, two years later. I was in the Champaign newspaper, and on Daily Illini, twice, thanks to this endeavor. Needless to say I learned a lot.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m0odwtgl0fs41.jpg?width=988&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0092a54056909ba961c4d06cb1b30090e93788ae\n\nCrane #3 Near County Market\n\nJust proving to myself, eight months later, that I was still alive.\n\nTalbot Laboratory\n\nWas walking by this building one day when I noticed some massive doorhinges on one of the back walls. I climbed up them and onto the low roof, avoided some office windows, then took a series of tall ladders to the roof of the building.\n\nCrane #4 Green Street\n\nThis crane was asking for it. What a prime location. Unfortunately, the arm wasn\u2019t dangling over Green Street on the night I decided to climb it. So, I opted not to go out on the arm \u2013 for the first time in my history of climbing cranes. My sponsor would call this, progress.\n\nClosing Arguments:\n\nDid I ever climb intoxicated?\n\nNo. Some things that you love should be tried under the influence. Football. Sex. This is not one of those things.\n\nWhy do I climb?\n\nAhhhhhhhhh\n\nWill I continue to urban climb?\n\nProbably, but with less gusto than I did during 2017. Turning 20 in the hospital was a real eye-opener for me.\n\nShould you urban climb?\n\nProbably not.\n\nAny advice?\n\nIf you decide to start urban climbing, be smart, not rash. Adrenaline is great but it fogs long-term judgement. It\u2019s also no substitute for real happiness.\n\nIf you made it this far, thanks for reading :-)\n\nA rough map of buildings, balconies, and cranes that I\u2019ve climbed in Champaign within memory, excluding climbing gyms:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t237dg4r0fs41.jpg?width=736&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1409f3499287027984926a9cb207e2fda6ba3245", "title": "Tales of an Urban Freesolo Climber at UIUC"}, {"created_utc": 1586713453, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/g0161r/privacy_rso/", "id": "g0161r", "is_self": true, "score": 2, "selftext": "Hey everyone!

I have no idea if anything will be done about it, I will give an update later, but here is the email I wrote. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDear Professor \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_,  \nI just received your email regarding getting familiarized with Proctorio. I understand that the university has a special contract with Proctorio that guarantees\u00a0that all requested permissions are only used for proctoring\u00a0purposes, and that data is encrypted and only instructors have access\u00a0to the recordings. Nevertheless, I still believe that use of this application constitutes an invasion of privacy. Furthermore, my concerns extend to fairness for students who may not have easy access\u00a0to a space that meets the requirements of the application (for example, their computer might be in a shared space).\u00a0  \nIn this situation, my consent to Proctorio's terms of service are being coerced, as failure to consent to the terms of service will result in a zero on the exam. While I understand the pressure that the university is under to adopt new applications\u00a0for remote learning, introducing this requirement in the middle of the term is unacceptable.\u00a0   \nA list of specific concerns:\n\n* I object to submitting a scan of my private space to this application and to university personnel.\n* I object to disabling web extensions and proxies, resetting Chrome, etc. This is, at the least, inconvenient, but can also prevent security software from functioning properly.\n* I object\u00a0to the requirement to remove all other monitors from my room, as I should not have to rearrange my private space to meet the needs of the university.\n\nFurther, I do not believe that the use of a proctoring service is necessary, as this situation has been handled better in other courses I am taking. For example, PHYS 212 used an online test that could run on UIUC internal servers for security, and required acknowledgement of an honors code for academic and ethical integrity. Math 286 had a similar system with an honors code requiring everyone to agree to not get help from students or resources other than what was explicitly allowed. Proctorio does make it difficult to cheat, but it is far from infallible, those who want to cheat will find a way to cheat. For those who want to take the exam honestly and earn the grade they deserve, Proctorio will present a logistical boundary and a major privacy concern.  \nMany fellow students have expressed similar concerns regarding the use of Proctorio and other similarly invasive online proctoring services. I urge you to consider an alternative platform for administering the upcoming test.  \nSincerely,\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_", "title": "Objecting to proctorio"}, {"created_utc": 1586811284, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/g0rf5y/can_someone_make_a_custom_black_ops_3_zombies_map/", "id": "g0rf5y", "is_self": true, "score": 89, "selftext": "Would b kinda fun doe.", "title": "Can someone make a custom Black ops 3 zombies map of the ECE building with grainger auditorium as the starting room?"}, {"created_utc": 1586812400, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/g0rrz6/uiuc_nursing/", "id": "g0rrz6", "is_self": true, "score": 1, "selftext": "My roommate just got waitlisted at UIUC nursing.

How cycle-friendly are the environments? How easily can I switch majors? WHICH SCHOOL SHOULD I CHOOSE?**\n\nHere's the thing. I'm not super interested in Applied Physics at Gatech, and **I might want to switch** to CS or Mechanical or something. On their website, it says that I'm allowed one unrestricted change in my major (but only after October 24th). So that's cool because I don't think I'll be taking many major-specific courses in the summer or fall term, so I wouldn't be lagging behind too much. How true is that, though?\n\nBesides, I know a bit of CS already, and the foundational courses for mechanical are prolly very similar to those of Applied Physics. A friend says that it's pretty easy to switch majors in your freshman year; Gatech is not too strict about that. How true is that, though?\n\nI know CS is ranking higher at UIUC, but I know anyone would lean towards Gatech for mechanical. Heck, I might even want to minor in Robotics or major in something like aero once I'm given more exposure to the subject, so Gatech is better in those cases, right? Also, **how much does the \"name\" matter**? I mean, surely mechanical at Gatech is better than at Harvard, but Harvard's \"name\" is so much more prestigious. How much of a factor is that?\n\nThere's another aspect - dorms. I know that most engineering majors at UIUC live really close to the main quad, which is where most engineering classes happen, which is nice. I'm not sure about the situation at Gatech, though... I've watched a few dorm tours for UIUC and Gatech, and I've noticed that **the rooms at UIUC are generally bigger** and house two students, instead of Gatech's four students. How true is this, though? Personally, I'd prefer fewer people in my room.\n\nLastly, cycling. I love to cycle, and I'm pretty sure that **my cycling experience at Gatech would be tons better than at UIUC**. UIUC snows for like 6 months throughout the academic year, 6 months of walking! Yuck. I can handle walking, sure, but if I could cycle, I would definitely choose to do so. I've heard that it barely snows in Atlanta, so I can cycle pretty much always. It's just more convenient and efficient.

I never had the time to do it while in school but now I've created this project.\n\nIt works with Verilator (open source) instead of Modelsim, which allows you to create a test bench in C++. The first thing you can do out of the box is draw to an 80x25 text mode VGA terminal ([demo](https://twitter.com/umenthum/status/1248791832470990848)) and also write to the simulation process' stdout via the UART module. If you add interrupt support to your core, you can get UART (think stand-in for having a keyboard) interrupts whenever input comes in from the simulation process' stdin. Finally, if you add support for the debug extension (actually not much harder than adding interrupts, it's very doable) you can attach the OpenOCD debugger and attach GDB to that to debug the code running on your core, just like attaching GDB to QEMU in ECE391.\n\nUnfortunately I haven't published this with a working core because I designed it around the course staff's MP1 solution. If you have any trouble using the test bench, please let me know so I can improve usability. If you want pointers on implementing interrupts or the debug extension for your design, feel free to reach out. I can give you an overview of my implementation, point you to relevant chapters of the various RISC-V specs, and even share some snippets of code that aren't related to the ECE411 MPs.\n\nI had a lot of fun and learned a lot while making this, I hope at least a few of you try it out and have the same experience!", "title": "Current and former ECE411 students: try running your RISC-V CPU with this interactive test bench: a fun introduction to UART, SystemC/TLM, and JTAG, with a bit of text mode VGA"}, {"created_utc": 1586890378, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/g1bf31/double_majoring/", "id": "g1bf31", "is_self": true, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hello everyone, I'm a high school senior and currently deciding between colleges.

How cycle-friendly are the environments? How easily can I switch majors? WHICH SCHOOL SHOULD I CHOOSE?**\n\nHere's the thing. I'm not super interested in Applied Physics at Gatech, and **I might want to switch** to CS or Mechanical or something. On their website, it says that I'm allowed one unrestricted change in my major (but only after October 24th). So that's cool because I don't think I'll be taking many major-specific courses in the summer or fall term, so I wouldn't be lagging behind too much. How true is that, though?\n\nBesides, I know a bit of CS already, and the foundational courses for mechanical are prolly very similar to those of Applied Physics. A friend says that it's pretty easy to switch majors in your freshman year; Gatech is not too strict about that. How true is that, though?\n\nI know CS is ranking higher at UIUC, but I know anyone would lean towards Gatech for mechanical. Heck, I might even want to minor in Robotics or major in something like aero once I'm given more exposure to the subject, so Gatech is better in those cases, right? Also, **how much does the \"name\" matter**? I mean, surely mechanical at Gatech is better than at Harvard, but Harvard's \"name\" is so much more prestigious. How much of a factor is that?\n\nThere's another aspect - dorms. I know that most engineering majors at UIUC live really close to the main quad, which is where most engineering classes happen, which is nice. I'm not sure about the situation at Gatech, though... I've watched a few dorm tours for UIUC and Gatech, and I've noticed that **the rooms at UIUC are generally bigger** and house two students, instead of Gatech's four students. How true is this, though? Personally, I'd prefer fewer people in my room.\n\nLastly, cycling. I love to cycle, and I'm pretty sure that **my cycling experience at Gatech would be tons better than at UIUC**. UIUC snows for like 6 months throughout the academic year, 6 months of walking! Yuck. I can handle walking, sure, but if I could cycle, I would definitely choose to do so. I've heard that it barely snows in Atlanta, so I can cycle pretty much always. It's just more convenient and efficient. Let me know your thoughts.\n\nThanks for all your responses!!!", "title": "UIUC or Gatech?!

I know this isn't quite the best time to share because no one can go anywhere, but I figured it help me pass the time. Spoiler: Many of these places might only be accessible to you by car (or sometimes by bus). \n\n* Plant Mode: Charming plant nursery in Champaign. The owner is super nice, helpful and knowledgeable. I have around 6 plants from that store.  \n\n* Riggs Brewery: This one is mentioned on this subreddit quite a bit. But its my favorite, so I though I would share anyways. Single-handedly made me love German beer.  \n\n* Stix Arcade Bar: Fairly new bar in downtown Champaign. Its not just a bar, they have a spread of arcade games and a few consoles. Gets really, really crowded and cramped unfortunately.  \n\n* Astro Observatory: Most everyone knows where this observatory is on campus. But some people don't know that they occasionaly have open house nights where you can come in, see the equipment, and ask questions. Kind of cool experience. \n\n* Station Thearte: Virginia Theartre and Krannert do a lot of cool shows and what not, but so does Station. Station is unique because its a very intimate experience. Located right by Black dog in Urbana.  \n\n* See You CD &amp; Vinyl: I enjoy buying records, and this is a great place to do it. Another small business ran by a nice, helpful and knowledgeable owner. \n\n* Exile on Main Street: The other place where I buy records. Also includes a lot of fun thrift shopping. \n\n* Sipyard: If you're in town during the city, this is a great place to go. Its an alley in downtown Urbana that sells beer. On great nights they have live music and people bring their dogs. \n\n* Orpheum Children's Science Musuem: If you have small siblings or family that come to visit, I think this is a great place to bring them. As a college student, even I enjoyed some aspects of it.  \n\n* Crystal Lake Park: Unfortunately, the \"nature\" here in UC is limited or non-existent. If you want to see a body of water that isn't Boneyard creek, and you can't drive out of town.. Crystal Lake isn't a bad replacement.  \n\n* Urbana Boulders: I'm not good at rock climbing in the slightest, but ~15-20$ gets you a whole day of climbing here. And I think its fun, and its certainly quite the workout. Definitely not a place to walk to if you're anywhere near campus.     \n\nHope you guys are all doing well during this time.

I don't even think I'm a bad test-taker, but making it online (and through goddamn prairielearn where we know our scores immediately) has deeply impacted my confidence during the test, making me blank out.\n\nI don't want this post to just be a rant, but if yours went bad too/you feel the same, don't you think we should contact the professor and ask him to release our curved scores before Apr. 30, so that we know where we stand? So that we can make an informed decision to make it Credit/No Credit? I'm literally at that point in this class, and I can't hurt my GPA.\n\nI'm only posting this here to know how it went for a few more people. Me contacting the professor about this alone won't do anything (if the test was actually easy for y'all).\n\nif it went well for you, good job.

I recently accepted my offer to UIUC's grad program, but I'm having serious second thoughts since I was unable to visit it due to the coronavirus outbreak. I visited in the virtual open house, but it just didn't feel the same as getting to know the professors and graduate students in person.\n\nI got accepted into other schools with much better financial packages and locations, but I ended up deciding that UIUC's stronger program would be the best choice for me. Since I am unsure exactly what field I want to go into, I thought UIUCs large size would give me an opportunity to try a lot of different things with world-class faculty, though I am primarily here for the solid state program.\n\nI've lived in the midwest for a majority of my life, and to be honest, I can't really tolerate it much more. Everything else about the program seems great, and I know it seems like a shallow reason to be second guessing my decision. I was just curious if anyone else had the same problems, or what other physics graduates think. I don't mean to insult the school - far from it - UIUC seems like a great place to be. I'm just not entirely confident that I chose the right program for ME. My main questions are:\n\nHow is the cameradery between students? Are the first couple years manageable? What do you like best/least about UIUC or the towns surrounding it?

It might work very similarly, but would at least have source code that you and others could inspect and audit. This might at least alleviate some of the concerns about what data is being collected, where it is going, and how it will be used.

I've heard that ECE 391 really requires one to be comfortable with programming/version control/debugging (specifically talking about tools like Valgrind and GDB). I've chugged along well enough through ECE 220 and CS 225, but I'm by no means extremely fluent at these things.

My dad, an embedded systems guy who's done a lot of work with Linux kernel related work, is really discouraging me from taking ECE 391 next semester.\n\nReally, beyond my skills, I'm worried about my ability to manage my workload. I have ADHD, and I have trouble with time management.

Are these classes the right move to increase attractiveness to grad schools as a non-major? Are there any alternatives that you can suggest over these two?

I know that you're supposed to take 233 before 241, so is the 233 prereq really enforced? I've heard mixed news about that, so I'd like to survey the field. The reason I'd like to take 241 over 233 is that its title is explicitly Systems Programming, which would tick off another prereq.\n3. Bonus: with these six classes, some AE classes that do intersect with CS in interesting ways, demonstrated interest in CS, a CS-based research project, and some work experience in SWE, would that be enough to be attractive enough to grad schools?

Just check both of those filters!\n* Want to know what ECE 400 levels are being offered this semester? Type in `ECE 4[0-9][0-9]` and check Fall 2020! Yes, this supports regex, and you can do some pretty powerful things due to this. For example, `(?!CS)([A-Z]+ 4[0-9][0-9])` matches all 400 levels not in CS. (could be used to find advanced electives, for example) Check out more regex examples in the Help section of the website\n* Comprehensive grade distributions for each course, including +/- letter grades.\n* Support for cross listed courses: you don't need to know which department the course really belongs to, just type in `ECE 374` and it will show the statistics for `CS 374`.\n* Per semester GPA statistics: select the semester you want to view the statistics for in the drop down menu, and you can view statistics for that semester including average GPA, per professor's average GPA, and a cool graph of the grade distribution!\n* All searches are sorted by GPA from highest to lowest. So you can use this search engine to look for the easiest classes which satisfy any criteria!\n* Links to the latest course explorer for each course, so that you can look at the course availability for the current semester!  \n  \nI was inspired by Professor Wade's [amazing](http://waf.cs.illinois.edu/discovery/grade_disparity_between_sections_at_uiuc/) [course](http://waf.cs.illinois.edu/discovery/gpa_of_every_course_at_illinois/) [visualizations](http://waf.cs.illinois.edu/discovery/every_gen_ed_at_uiuc_by_gpa/) and wanted to build one which encompassed all of their features, and more!

He was also employed at the McShane Bell Company, which cast our chime's bells.\n\nMcShane Bell sent Mr. Mettee to the University of Illinois to play the dedication concert on October 30, 1920. According to news reports on the thirty-first, he performed the concert beautifully, but apparently fainted during his performance of \"Illinois Loyalty\" due to a sickness from which he thought he had fully recovered.\n\nFor the next few days, Mr. Mettee stuck around to teach a number of students and university figures to play the chime. His most notable student was Albert Austin Harding, director of the university band.\n\nHis arrangements have largely been lost to time.

I had a question about the University Housing Contract that I was wondering if anyone on this subreddit might be able to answer. I looked at a few other posts in this subreddit, but I still got mixed answers to my question.\n\nI am currently enrolled in and attending UIUC, but I am also waitlisted for admission into UC-Berkeley. I was just about to complete my Housing Contract when I noticed a clause that stated \"If your plans change and you will not be attending the University of Illinois, you must notify both University Housing and the Office of Admissions. Failure to honor this contract may result in a settlement fee of up to 75% of your room and board costs for the contract year.\"\n\nIf I am offered admission into Berkeley and decide to go there, would I have to pay the settlement fee? Right now, I'm particularly unsure about when the fee would begin to apply. The contract mentions that for new students, the fee starts to apply after May 15 immediately after the contract is completed, but it also mentions students having 30 days to cancel their contract. Furthermore, does the fee apply after the general University Housing Contract is completed, or only after I have chosen and filled out a contract for a specific room?\n\nI will likely find out about Berkeley in May, and if I have 30 days to cancel without consequence, I could fill out the housing contract before the May 15 priority deadline. If not, I might wait to submit the contract as long as possible. There is also the mention of the settlement fee being waived \"If a student no longer attends the University\" on the contract, which I thought could apply to enrolling at another school, but the clause I mentioned earlier seems to contradict this.\n\nThere is also the matter of the COVID-19 Pandemic, and how it may affect our college lives in the fall. If instruction ends up being completely off-campus and online next semester, there may be no housing fee to worry about. However, I really hope this doesn't end up being the case \ud83e\udd1e.\n\nThank you so much for any feedback on this! Take care and stay healthy!
