I reassured I could pay the bills of the house and he said alright and shook my hand and left. 2 hours later my father gets a text from my uncle saying that I could no longer stay at the house and just because my father was the executor he had no power in a 2 vs 1 decision, I should also mention that the trust has not yet been started as our lawyer is slow(I assume)\n\nMy question is do I have any rights in a non-written verbal agreement and does my father having 1/3 claim to the estate give us any rights to the house to stay in and live?", "title": "2 days out from moving in to grandparents house was told I (20m, IL)can no longer move in."}, {"created_utc": 1578018593, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/ej8pqs/the_company_i_work_for_mn_is_going_through_a/", "id": "ej8pqs", "is_self": true, "score": 7, "selftext": "Hello,\n\nSo I work a sales position for a medical supply company in Minnesota that is going through a merger.

I just received a request for a refund of unemployment benefits, just over $10K I need to pay back. \n\nI had over 22 operations on both feet to remove the skin from the bottom of both feet. I had hundreds of plantar warts on the side and bottom of my feet. I almost had two of my toes removed. I was working as a bartender and decided to start having operations on both feet every Monday for twelve weeks straight. I told the owner of the bar/restaurant my situation and that I was having operations on Mondays and to not put me on the schedule until Thursday. I would work Thursday from 10:30 am to 8 pm, Friday from 10:30 am to 10 pm, Saturday and Sunday Open to close. From Monday to Thursday night the pain was excruciating from my procedures. At the beginning of every appointment, my podiatrist would take a scalpel and debride warts without anesthesia. Then he would pore a Cantharidin/Salicylic Acid/Podophyllin compound on my open wounds. Over the next twenty-four hours, you can feel every layer of your skin separating and filling with blood. The entire bottom of both feet were blood blisters that stuck out half an inch from the normal surface. The only relief I had was to clean an x-acto blade with boiling water and alcohol and cut the blisters open. For the remainder of the week until the following Monday, I would cover my feet in over the counter Salicylic Acid multiple times a day.  \nSo I was going through this every week for twelve weeks and my chain got messed up. Lost ankle strength, knees began to track wrong, and lower back and hip function went to hell. I started physical therapy for my back while I was still working and having operations. I eventually couldn't handle the pain as my back couldn't get better because of the feet. My supervisor/the owner knew all of this information. He told me I could take time off to get better and that my job would be there when I get better. I lost my health insurance initially and couldn't receive Medicaid because of a claim I made the year before but I was making too much money. I didn't get health insurance for another 4 months and started physical therapy again. At this point, the skin on my feet are better but the muscles in my lower body had atrophied and I was needed to put in work. I had been corresponding with my boss the whole time. I applied for unemployment 5 months after I stopped working because I didn't think I would be out of work for so long and I never quit and didn't get fired. I blew through my savings and was looking for assistance. I applied. I told them my story. I got approved. I continued physical therapy. When I asked my old boss to come back he said there are no hours available, so basically I don't have a job. I wasn't able to find work for a while but I finally started working thanks to a recruitment agency and have a sit-down job. I just received a notice in the mail saying I owe $10,348 for a refund of unemployment benefits because I quit my job without a good cause. I'm devastated. When I applied for unemployment I told the agent my situation and she said that was a good cause. My Boss knew my situation. I was approved for benefits. Now I don't know what to do.

TIA for reading this.  \n\n\nI'm (F36, in NYC) subletting from someone who turned out to be very dishonest and I'm moving out this month. She is the the only lease holder.\n\nI don't trust at all that she will hand me back my security deposit once I leave so I told her to keep my deposit in lieu of rent - that did not go well. What can I do? I've read of putting the rent money in escrow for things not being fixed etc, but that is not the case here. Is there anything I can or should do to cover my legal bases?\n\nShort story long:\n\n I moved in July 2019, it was advertised a minimum 6 month sublet that I could then continue month to month up to a year. I discussed this at the viewing because I would want longer than 6 months and was told the room would be available after the 6 months, just let her know then how much longer I want to stay.\n\n  \nApt is a 2 bedroom 1 bath with a converted lv room. Person whose room I'm subletting is the lease holder and was leaving the apartment. There are 2 other roommates (one M30s, one F20s),  I was adamant that I did not want more roommates, she was clear she was leaving.\n\n  \nDays after my move in, she came to the apartment and tried to sneak into my room. My room door was closed but unlocked, and I was inside fresh out the shower. It was during the day so she thought the house was empty and I gone. She told me she \"was curious and just wanted to see what it looked like\". So I stood there wrapped in my bath towel while this lady came in and then talked at me for an hour about her dead mother and all this other tmi stuff. I figured she was just in a bad emotional place and let go that she was trying to sneak in my room, but I've locked the door since.\n\n  \n2 weeks after move in, and she was here all the time. All day sitting at the kitchen table or cleaning things. I ask what is going on and she tells me that she was moving to her brother's but she had to leave (or got kicked out?) and some bullshit about staying here with my other roommate (F) for a little bit but \"not to worry I'm still ok subletting the room\".\n\n  \nAlmost a month later and she was still here, all day everyday, and I asked her what's the deal, because this was not what I signed up for and I was concerned - this time she's \"moving to her uncle's across the street, he has guests now but in a few days.\"  \nThat day comes and there's no uncle, there's no move, she's actually \"going to live here sharing the other roommates room\". I told her this situation was not what I agreed to, to please be honest with me in the future instead of letting me stress for 2 months about what is going on.\n\nI also find out she is charging me over half the rent despite there being now 4 people (my rent is $1200, apt is $2100) which I think she is allowed to do, but not paying the actual rent to the landlord, she owed months of rent. I don't know if she has since paid it all.\n\n  \nThrough this whole time she has been awful and bizarre, it's made my living situation needlessly bad. It adds insult to injury that I'm extremely clean, keep to myself and pay rent on time every time. This is already long but here are some choice examples to paint this shitty picture and why I think this person is not all there and cannot be trusted:\n\n\\-Refuses to give me a mail key. First because she \"will check the mail herself for everyone\" which she doesn't do everyday, couldn't when she was hospitalized, etc. I receive time sensitive packages for my job and got screwed repeatedly by this bs. After many requests she made me a \"copy\" - the key didn't work. She said she would make another copy and never did. I gave up trying.\n\n\\-Everything is a problem to this person - there's a speck of dirt on the stove, I get a text. A literal speck. There's a pan in the sink soaking for 2 hours, I get a text because she wants to rinse something in the sink and my 10\" pan impedes her (to paint a picture, this person constantly leaves dirty dishes and food out, I think these constant texts are just to be controlling). Wanting to be a good roommate, at first she'd say jump and I'd say how high, and go clean whatever even if it was bizarre or wasn't my dirty-ing. After a while the bs increased and I just stopped responding. These texts have mostly stopped. She is also a bit unhinged - turned on the sink to flood the bathroom to then yell for me because I \"left the sink running\" (I did not), I left muddy prints in the bathroom (I had been there barefoot hours before and when I checked these mystery prints were her own shoes), she \"tripped\" in the bathroom and it was my fault - this one was quite the doozy, we all got texted that she \"almost needed to call 911\" because she fell down and is very injured, it must be my fault showering with the curtain open (who even does that?), she will of course need a doctor tout suite (she never went to the doctor, surprise). Everything to this person is dramatic, and a near death miss, and she is just so frail. If this person was a sound, she'd be a whimpering sigh.\n\n\\-To contrast with \"there's a dirt speck, you must clean now!\" this person has her clutter everywhere (since she now has no room) and although she constantly cleans certain things, other things she is oblivious - blood on the toilet bowl, doesn't flush her pee, leaves the bathroom door open while using it. Something is just not right with this person and the bathroom. I have not complained because it's the least of my problems, except one time that I slammed the bathroom door shut after walking in on her in the morning for the 100th time. It's not closed but unlocked, it's just open enough that you might think it's free but cannot see in, and then surprise!\n\n  \n\\-She poisoned my bathroom items. This is the scary part. She put what we think (by the awful smell) is urine and rotten eggs in my bathroom things. Did I think I was going nuts at first? Yes I did. First I got the ubiquitous text that I left a speck of my body oil in the bathroom and her tshirt was now stained from touching said speck. Days later I'm using the oil and it feels funny, smells funny. I open it and it has a foul stench. Weeks later I open my clothing detergent (my other thing in the bathroom) and it's the same stench - it's so intense it makes you heave. I think she also put soap in my tea. I didn't drink it, and now feel like a paranoid person.\n\n\\-She has clearly been in my room while I'm gone, by the way she talks. My room has a door lock and I imagine she has a copy of the key herself.\n\n  \n\\-The cherry on top, she now lives in the hallway closet. Yes, that's right, she rents her room to me and then goes to sleep in a closet. I thought she was in the other roommates room all along like she said, but turns out nope! She has been using the closet as her room (this is NY, rooms are the size of closets, not the other way around). I know, it's nuts. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo here we are. In November she let me know despite what she said when I rented, she would not be prolonging the sublease, and \"granting me an extension\" and I should move by Feb 1st. Not what I originally wanted but given the circumstances I need to get out of dodge anyway. I told her I would move in January or February, depending on when I find a place (it's slim pickings in the winter). She gave me paperwork to sign that always had suspicious language, and when asked to rectify she didn't so I just told her I was not comfortable signing. It was made to look like an eviction, and maybe it's perfectly fine, but I just don't trust this person.\n\nI told her I would be moving January 15th, and to keep my deposit (which was half a month's rent) as rent. I don't think given her history she would ever pay me back my deposit, as she's been scamming me all along. I don't want to then have to chase this person in court and continue this nightmare. What can I do? She started yelling at me and going off the rails and now I'm so apprehensive about leaving the house and her going in my room or doing something crazy. I just want to cover my bases.\n\nThank you for sticking with me, help me Reddit, if you can.", "title": "Using my deposit as last month's rent because of dishonest overtenant"}, {"created_utc": 1578024981, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/eja1pc/missouri_i_didnt_get_a_survey_on_my_property_when/", "id": "eja1pc", "is_self": true, "score": 145, "selftext": "In October of 2018 I bought my first home with my boyfriend. We went though a real estate agent we hang out with. He told us, since our home was listed as a double lot, and we had a fence around the entire perimeter, that a survey wasn\u2019t very important, maybe a few feet different but nothing to worry about. We saved our money for the closing cost, and unknowingly made the biggest mistake we\u2019ve ever made. \n\nThis started with an empty lot bordering our fence. We wanted to purchase the lot to reduce the mosquitoes in our back yard and have a place for a greenhouse, the empty lot was terribly unkept and was truly an eyesore to everyone on our little dead end road. We called the assessors office, they gave us the name of the owner of the lot next to our address. After some googling, we had a woman\u2019s phone number and we called her the next day. She wasn\u2019t aware she owned the lot, and told us she had lost it in bankruptcy. Turns out, the woman we contacted lived in our home in 2012, and was the last person to own it as a double lot, she thought the bank took it during her bankruptcy when they took the house. The lot we thought we bought was half of the actual property we owned. And being dumb first time home buyers, we never thought to look at the measurements in our title. The man that sold it to us bought the house out of bankruptcy, fixed it up a bit and sold it, thinking he purchased a double lot like it appears. Anyone that looks at the house would think it\u2019s a double lot, our walkway to our door leads to the other lot, and our entire driveway is on the other lot. We contacted this woman on October 20th, and by October 30th she was a nightmare. We agreed to pay her $5,000 for the lot, she went to pay her taxes the next day and found out the assessed value was $40,000. I still don\u2019t understand that price, because larger lots in better areas are not assessed that high. Once she got this information and payed the taxes, she decided she\u2019s going to build a house on what was originally our side yard. Which, for the record is a 35 foot wide lot. A few weeks pass and we talked to everyone involved in the selling of our home. Everyone pointed fingers to other people, or blamed us for not getting a survey. She had a survey done a few days before thanksgiving, and her property is one foot from the edge of our home. The sidewalk leading to my back yard (which is the only entrance to the entire back of my property) is hers. I own one foot of concrete by my home, one foot of concrete on a two car driveway that my walkway leads to. On December 24th, she removed the front part of my privacy fence and put up galvanized chicken wire \u201cfencing\u201d to separate the lots, as well as private property signs. I\u2019ve never been so embarrassed in my life. Today she came by and said she was going to cut my sidewalk so our concrete wouldn\u2019t be on her property. She\u2019s sent us text, left voicemails and even showed up at our house unexpectedly, she seems to know when I\u2019m off work and always drops by when I\u2019m home alone. I\u2019m not a big person, I get intimidated easily and she\u2019s really doing a number on me.

Our water has stopped working twice. After the second time our heat and water stopped working, we asked our landlord if she would kindly let us out of the lease, so that we could find a place that has reliable utilities. She said no, and that we would have to continue paying rent until she founds someone else to rent it, or until our lease is up in May 2020. \"Whichever happens first\". We've spent several weeks and days not able to live (3 separate occasions) in our home, and it's causing me mental and emotional damage to not be able to count on our heat staying on. I live in the interior of Alaska and it gets anywhere from 20 degrees farenheit to -50 in the winter...\n\n&amp;amp;amp;#x200B;\n\nOur heat was broken when we moved in, our landlord said that he kept the baseboard heat off in the summer and that we'd have to use the propane space heater which is attached to the wall. It didn't work (pilot light wouldn't light), but we didn't bring this up to him and just brought a space heater from my folks' house and used that until it started to get chilly at night in September. \n\nThen he sold the place to this other woman. Our lease got transferred. \n\nWhen we brought up the heat issue to the new owner of the house (8/12/19), she said that the heat was actually broken and that it needed repairs. She promptly (4 days) had the propane space heater fixed so the pilot light would work, but the heat doesn't really reach into the bedroom because it's fixed to the wall in the living room. \n\nThen she had someone come \"fix\" the baseboard heat about a little over a month after I initially brought it to her attention (fixed 9/16/19). It seemed to be working, until it got incredibly hot, and after 4 days of not sleeping and being so tired at work that I couldn't stand it anymore, I tell my land lady that my boyfriend, my cat and I are going to stay with some friends until the heat is fixed and at a livable temperature. It completely upheaved our lives and we were living out of suitcases  on the floor of one of my Dad's spare rooms for 10 days. (9/20/19 - 9/30/19).\n\nApparently the heat for both my house and the house next to mine is pumped through the same mechanism, and was stuck and not getting into my neighbor's house which is why I had all the heat? That's how I understood it at least. \n\nFast forward about a month and a half later in November (11/5/19). Temperatures here in my town in November were about 20-33 F degrees average. We wake up in the morning and my boyfriend takes a shit in the toilet, and realizes that the toilet won't flush. None of the water works. We let our land lady know know about the problem via text. We realize that we have no idea how long this one will take to fix, so we pack up our suitcases once again, and move our lives (and cat) to my Dad's spare room floor, again. \n\nLater that day we haven't heard back about the water, so we go to check on the house. Our heat was broken again, leaving our house very cold. We were at my Dads house this time for two days before it was fixed 11/5/19 - 11/7/19. \n\nMy boyfriend and I are in complete disarray. Our stuff is everywhere, we are tired because we can't sleep very well on my Dad's floor. Our cat is developing a nervous IBS disorder which comes in painful attacks, for which we end up taking him to the emergency vet one night while we were staying with my Dad. We end up paying somewhere close to $600 - $700 and a $300 vet visit a couple weeks after to find out that his stress is giving him these issues. I told my land lady this and she gives me $100 of next month's rent. This is when I asked her if we could get out of the lease, and she said not without continuing to pay rent. We were about to enter the COLD winter months and this was making us both very scared for our cat and our items that were in our home that would be destroyed if frozen. \n\nNext time the heat went out was in December, the day after Christmas (12/26/19). I had been house sitting while my boyfriend was watching our house and our cat, and Christmas day we took our cat to my Dad's house overnight (for fun this time, so we could drink and party with family) and the next day decide to go check on the house.\n\nWe get there, and the whole house is frozen. It's somewhere between -20 and -35 degrees outside, and it's the same temperature inside our home. All of my plants were dead, all of my food was frozen. The pipes burst. The toilet water froze and broke the toilet bowl. This was about a month and two weeks after the heat had gone out  the last time. \n\nWe have been living at my Dad's house since then. They pretty quickly got space heaters into my house but we still can\u2019t stay there because there\u2019s no toilet/water. It's been 8 days, they've been working to get everything fixed.

Every second of every day I am just infuriated...infuriated that I can't fucking sleep at night because we are sleeping on the floor while paying $1000 a month to someone for a place we can't live. I'm so angry that I have been falling asleep at work (and I work in health care and am not good at my job when I'm tired). \n\nAll of my morning health practices have gone out the window...everything just sucks right now. I just want to cry. I'm going to have to pay my dad back for the utilities we've used since we've been here.

However, they use a very similar font and are a similar style to Pantone colour chips distributed by Pantone themselves. I wondered even before selling these prints whether I might run into any legal trademarking issues, but figured I'd covered myself noting that they were my artistic representation, making it clear they are by no means a direct copy. I also assumed that since many other shops were selling very similar items, there must be some loophole that we are collectively working within.

Everything was fine and dandy until a couple days ago, when her psychotic ex re-emerged out of nowhere.\n\nShe received a notification that someone had logged into her iCloud email from an unknown web browser... it was her ex. Once she got that notification it was already too late, her ex had hacked into all of her social media accounts including Facebook, IG, and Snapchat and saw all of our conversations. Once he found out who I was, he started stalking me as well. I noticed he initially began stalking my LinkedIn page multiple times in a 24 hour period (it tells you every time someone views your profile) - so I blocked him on there and every other social media platform. Last night he evidently found me on Snapchat, which I also promptly blocked him from without a single message being sent, and to this day I have not had a single piece of correspondence with this shit bag.\n\nMy girl went down to the police station last night and filed a formal complaint after her ex had sent her a video of him logged into her Snapchat and going through all of our conversations. In this video he was visibly disturbed and it looks as if he was on some sort of drug and he was yelling at her. Thankfully, she got everything documented in a report and her ex was dumb enough to continue blowing up her phone in front of the police officer while she was down at the station.\n\nIn addition to fearing for her safety, I am also worried for mine. He is trying to get a hold of me and I have no doubt his intentions are not pure. I have also been getting phone calls from random numbers and thankfully I haven't answered them but I still fear it's him using spoof numbers or what not.\n\nMy overall question to all of this is: Is there anything I can do on my end to end the harassment? I don't want to continue being harassed by this dude and I am afraid he is going to post my girl's and I's private moments all over social  media. Could this be considered extortion/blackmail or does there have to be money involved? He also knows where I live and that alone is enough to keep me on edge. I really do not want to go through the trouble of going through the courts to get a restraining order for myself, but if there is another alternative out there I am open to hearing about it.\n\nI know  this was kind of long and rambly and I apologize as my mind is not in the best state at the moment. Again, I thank you for reading over this and for any advice you can give me regarding this matter. I look forward to hearing back from you all.", "title": "Fear of Safety from Girl's Ex Boyfriend's Stalkerish Behavior"}, {"created_utc": 1578064619, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/ejgq33/landlord_publicly_displayed_mt_ssn_washington/", "id": "ejgq33", "is_self": true, "score": 131, "selftext": "I'm in the middle of a messy move-out from a room that I have rented for many years from from this guy who seems to be going a bit nuts in his aging brain.\n\nLong story short, he weirdly showed up at my parents house (I'm an able, working, 31 year-old man) and upon making no contact with them because they were at work, taped a copy of the move-out notice to their front door, face-out, with  my social security number and name clearly written on it.\n\nIn Washington State, does a landlord, or anyone who has requested my social for legitimate reason have any sort of responsibility to NOT PUBLICLY DISPLAY my social security number or to maintain its confidentiality?", "title": "Landlord publicly displayed mt SSN [Washington State]"}, {"created_utc": 1578065916, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/ejh0q5/locksmith_and_electrician_lurking_in_my_apartment/", "id": "ejh0q5", "is_self": true, "score": 21, "selftext": "Throwaway account \n\nMy apartment has the circuit breakers for all of th and units in my building.\n\nI received an email yesterday night from the property manager to let me know that another unit was having an electrical issue and they needed an electrician to come into my apartment to see the circuit breaker.

I displayed the idea on a Facebook page for Wooden Flag Makers. The idea was to show my ingenuity and, at the time, I had NO intent on selling templates. I don't even make them, I have them made for me.\n\nWell, the idea was VERY popular and a lot of people started wanting me to make them. Mine are laser cut from 16 ga. stainless steel.\n\nSoon after, someone else announced that they could make the templates as well. I had absolutely no problem with this and he, and I, talk regularly about designs and ideas. His are plasma cut from 14 ga. steel sheet. He advertises his templates on Etsy and other places, he also has a YouTube video out showing how to use the stencil for carving the stars.\n\nAgain, I am COMPLETELY OK with him and his company. For reference, i will refer to his as \"My buddy\" below.\n\nHOWEVER, he has just notified me that he had been served with a notice from a lawyer stating that his marketing of metal stencils violates a patent application from a company that makes burn stencils - stencils specifically for burning images on wood. They can also be used for painting and/or embossing. Basically, it was a cease and desist letter...\n\nHere is the kicker...it is a PROCESS patent. It is not a patent on the template itself..it is a patent on the process of how they are used. Meaning that anyone who uses a metal stencil to burn, carve, paint or emboss anything is violating the process patent.\n\nThis is complete and utter BULLSHIT (excuse the language but I am HOT). The process of using templates, some metal, for carving has been around for decades. The use of stencils to make signs as router templates has been around for decades...\n\nMy buddy sent me a picture of the letter he was presented. It has the name of the company seeking the process patent and I have a \"docket number\" that was received at the patent office.\n\nI could care less if I sell another metal template..but I do use them for carving the unions for my flags and several others do as well. This process patent would have everyone in infringement of the patent. Some people do this to support their families or are disabled veterans who find the templates therapeutic...\n\nSo, getting to my question, IS there a way to block a patent application?

My mother informed the travel agent she wanted to spend no more than between $6,000-$10,000 total for the trip. My Mother's friend agreed she didn't want to spend more than $5,000 for her portion. My Mother's friend recommended her travel agent for my mother to use. My Mother's friend has some sort of agreement with this travel agent where their accommodations were supposed to be free due to 'points' my Mother's friend had with this travel agent. My mother was told the only expenses she would owe for their stays would be cleaning fees and that she would cover the security deposits. All other costs of the trip were to be equally split between my mother and her friend. \n\nAfter reviewing my Mother's accounts over Christmas, I realized a third-party company, on behalf of a travel agent my mother used, has charged my mother more than $50,000 total between her credit card and checking account beginning from before her trip, right up until the end of December. The travel agent is unable to provide invoices for the majority of the $50,000 charged to this third-party company. I was informed that because my mother\u2019s credit card and debit card have low daily limits, the travel agent partially paid for expenses for the trip with my mother\u2019s credit or debit card and then used funds from the third party company to pay for the rest of the cost. According to the travel, the $50,000 plus was my mother having to repay third-party company for costs they incurred when booking travel and fronting money for my mother. \n\nThe travel agent informed me that my mother and her friend opted to not stay at hotels so my Mother's friend's point could not be used, so they were billed for their stays. Further, it turns out my Mother's friend did not pay for any portion of her trip as the travel agent is claiming my Mother said she wanted to pay for the trip as a gift, something my Mother never said. My Mother's friend has not offered to reimburse my mother for half of the expenses. \n\nThe travel agent gained access to my mother\u2019s credit and debit card numbers by having my mother sign a letter of guarantee for payment. My mother had this letter notarized and provided it to the travel agent who was dishonest about the need for such a document. My mother did not understand the document she was signing and providing to the travel agent. Further, my mother did not authorize any of the charges that took place on her accounts after she returned from her trip. \n\nThe travel agent who defrauded my mother is based out of Orlando, FL and the third party servicer is said to be based out of the Dominican Republic, but all of the charges on her account are listed as taken from Florida.\n\nThe travel agent is able to provide information concerning account for around $20,000 of the $50,000. The travel agent is claiming $20,000 is related to two properties that are in a travel insurance dispute as the properties were dirty, moldy, and inferior to how they were presented before arrival. The travel agent is claiming that $20,000 is being held in escrow until the travel insurance pays out to the broker/servicer third-party company in question above. She says that when the insurance pays out to the third-party company, my mother\u2019s $20,000 will be reimbursed. The travel agent will not provide me with any information about where the money is being held in escrow or with what company. The travel agent is unable to account for the remaining balance my mother paid to the third party company. Further, the travel agent never provided my mother with any estimated costs for the trip, receipts for purchases, or any information related to the total cost of the trip. \n\nI have filed a fraud report with her local police, the FTC, and disputed the charges through her bank for the credit and checking account transactions. However, I am worried they will not accept this as fraud as the travel agent has my mother sign the guarantee of payment form and my mother volunteered her account information. I have also cancelled the card used for this fraud and opened her new accounts with a new bank.  \n\nMy main question is does my mother have any case if she needs to civilly sue either her friend of the travel agent if the bank refuses to recognize these transitions as fraud? \n\nApologies for this being rambling, it's quite a strange story, I will answer any questions to help clarify. \n\nTL;DR - My mother took a trip to Spain and France via a travel agent who ended up charing her cards over $50,000 under very strange circumstances. The charges are being disputed via her bank, but the bank doesn't know if they will be refunded to my mother.

The space heaters have a tendency to pop  breakers, which aren't necessarily accessible to residents (leaving you without electricity AND heat). \n\n\\- They've been absolutely appalling at communicating, with almost no updates and only a 45 minute warning that they were going to have to close the only access to the rear parking lot so the construction crews could dig up the pipes, which has left a handful of vehicles trapped for weeks, and has also closed off access to the dumpsters for garbage removal. Garbage has piled up, which they have been slowly hauling away via golf cart, but at times there have been heaps of trash laying around for days, creating unsanitary conditions. \n\nI believe, given Colorado's Warrant of Habitability, that I can withhold rent, assuming I can prove the heat and sanitation is inadequate (I have photos showing the temperature in my room at 53 degrees on a day when I guessed wrong on where to turn the dial on the heater, and piles of trash by the dumpster). \n\nI already emailed management to complain and ask to be let of out my lease and they responded \"We are not allowing lease terminations at this time as the issue is very close to being fixed and it goes against our lawyer\u2019s advice.

So instead of using an impact gun, he used a wrench and he overdid it and cracked your engine block.\u201d (Steel bolt, aluminum block, it checks out).\n\nObviously I was upset because I\u2019m supposed to move to California in 2 days, and now I might need a new engine. I figured it would be ok since my warranty covers a rental car so I should be ok to take that out there, drive it until the car fixed, and maybe even have them ship the car to LA so I could have it. However, this was NOT the case.\n\nWhen I went in to speak with the manager, he told me that the technician didn\u2019t crack the block, and that they were not liable for anything. In fact, he went as far as to say that the crack had probably been there the whole time and that he\u2019d have an inspector come out to see if it\u2019s covered by my warranty (which I also found odd because my warranty covers the entire engine, block and all). He said that that other store sold me a bad car and that this was their responsibility. This means I only get a rental car in my state up to $35/day for 10 days, and they won\u2019t pay for the $300 drop off fee for me taking it to California. This ALSO means that I\u2019m on the hook for getting my car out there when it\u2019s fixed, and if for some reason this crack isn\u2019t covered by warranty that I\u2019d be on the hook for all of the rental, the repair bill, labor, storage, etc. He advised me to talk to the store down the block that sold it to me.\n\nSo I went there to talk to the GM, where he told me that there\u2019s no way the engine block was cracked when they sold it because they do a 160 point inspection or whatever. He\u2019s saying that THEY are the ones that messed up the car, so THEY should be liable for any and all costs with that.\n\nSo basically, I was either sold a car with a cracked block or the dealer cracked it by accident. I don\u2019t care which dealership is responsible, the dealership chain itself is responsible. I\u2019ve had the car for 3 weeks and put maybe 200 miles on it, so it obviously isn\u2019t anything I\u2019ve done. Neither of them are willing to admit fault, and I\u2019m the only one on the hook for this rental car, transportation and probably repairs. I know if the seller sold it to me that way, they\u2019re in violation of some sort of Unfair Practice laws (a per se violation I believe), but I don\u2019t know what that really means lol.\n\nI just need to know if I have any type of legal leverage or if I\u2019m entitled to some type of compensation for this mishap.\n\nTLDR;\n\nEither the car I bought already had a cracked block, or the other dealer cracked it when doing repairs.

We hired them over the phone, and we did not sign a contract or give them any payment information (was not requested) and they came out to mow our lawn that week. Can't afford lawn mowing every week and would have never hired them for that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe following week they came back, and we let the technicians know that we only wanted one service and they did not need to mow our lawn that day. They basically said sorry, we just have to follow the list we get every day and they don't control that, but we will let the office know to remove your address. ok.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFollowing week, they return again, so we call the office directly instead of telling the technicians and let them know that we don't want them to return. Lady is nice but doesnt seem surprised, says ok its all cancelled and taken care of. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFollowing week they came again. We recieved no invoice for any services rendered at this point and have been told several times they would not come back but did. Emailed them to ask them to stop again, let them know we didnt get an invoice yet, but their website only has a submission form and no actual email so there is no way to keep a copy or cc myself. didn't really think about this at this point anyway, chalk it up to them being incompetent and figured we've done our due dilligence and forget about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey keep showing up and so we eventually to get the idea to put a lock on our fence. We have a dog and they would show up when we werent home or random times, mow and leave. We didn't want the dog getting out because of their negligence so we locked the fence. Also, figured they would stop if they couldn't get in to mow. Alas, they would still show up and mow the front if the fence wasn't unlocked.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirst invoice we recieve from them I don't see until December. Now, the first invoice is dated October but contains the months june, july, august, september. I honestly don't know if we just missed this in the mail or if they post dated it and didn't send it until much later. This is accompanied by another letter from them that contains ALL our invoices, a bill for $900, and a note that it will go to collections immediatley after christmas if we do not pay. This happens maybe 1 week before christmas.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI called them immediatley, spoke to the front desk. I wanted to tell them what happened and try to sort it out because I wasn't planning on paying for services we didn't want, ask for, and told them several times to stop. Receptionist says owner will call me back in 5 minutes. He doesnt. Call back again the same day a few hours later. She says sorry he probably got busy, he will call you shortly. Never does.

They have no public email address on their website or invoices so it was not possible to get a paper trail.\n\n\\-Lawn company has very few reviews. The good ones are mostly all from people with the same last name as the owner, and there are some bad ones very similar to ours talking about being sued or scammed by this company after they did services that weren't agreed upon or they were told they didnt want. One lady's situation was very similar to mine and I have reached out to her asking her to elaborate on what happened. Same with the lawn firm.\n\n\\-They damaged our vinyl fence with their equipment very badly such that it left a huge black mark and scratch around the entire inside of the fence. We have not brought this up to them at any point.\n\n-I tried looking up my old call records from when I phoned them to cancel and also my husband's to see when we originally first called them to hire them and  we couldn't find them using the company's current number. I'm not sure if they changed their number recently or what.   \n\n\n-i have spoken to another person who was sued by him for similar things and its pretty much what youd expect, she didnt end up fighting him in court because it would cost more than he (company owner) was asking for.\n\n\nTimeline for reference:\n\n\n\n-mid june, hire\n-end june, tell technician not to return\n-july, tell office to remove us from service, we only ever wanted one time, she agrees and says we are removed\n-july, tell technicians to stop coming again\n-first invoice dated october end.

Now reside in NY.\n\nHello, looking for some advice on my options here.\n\n\nIn April 2016 I leased a vehicle through a GMC dealer in my state. The lease was for 39 months with 15,000 annual miles.\n\n\nFast forward to June 2016, I'm starting to prepare to turn this vehicle in. I was over my mileage allowance by approx 5200 miles, so I wanted to see what the potential damage would be in excess mileage charges.\n\n\nCome to find out, when reviewing my physical copy of the lease agreement, the section that covers excess mileage stated: \"You may be charged for excessive wear based on our standards for normal use, and for mileage in excess of 15,000 miles per year at the rate of $ N/A per mile.\"\n\n\nHere is a photo of the lease agreement with the relevant portion circled: https://imgur.com/a/QMpmcUF\n\n\nWhat it appears happened is the finance manager at the dealership I leased the vehicle from erred when completing the paper work, and it was never caught by either the dealer, or GM Financial when the paperwork was submitted.\n\n\nI read the entire agreement from top to bottom to see if there's another section dealing with an excess mileage charge, and there isn't.\n\n\nAs expected, GM Financial sent me a final invoice, which can be seen here (identifying information removed): https://imgur.com/a/J6fWs1j \n\n\nThe invoice contained a few items that I knew that I would have to pay, such as a disposition fee, and taxes. Those charges totaled up to $650.38, which I paid. However, the invoice also showed a charge for $1306.50 for excess mileage. A fee, according to what's written in the lease agreement, that I don't believe that I owe.\n\n\nI contacted GM Financial to discuss the matter several times. Each conversation follows basically the same script. I ask them what I owe, they tell me $1306.50. I ask them what that charge is for. They tell me excess mileage. I ask them to look up my copy of the lease agreement and read to me what it says under the section covering excess mileage. They say oh...hang on a minute while I talk to my supervisor. They tell me that they'll have to review it further and call me back.\n\n\nInevitably, they never call me back. I've gone through this dance several times with them and just continue to get the runaround.\n\n\nHowever, this was only a minor annoyance until they started reporting the debt to the credit bureaus. \n\n\nWhen I realized this, I filed a dispute with all 3 credit bureaus. This was a couple of months ago, and they must have sent something to validate the debt, because they're still reporting me as overdue, thus lowering my credit score.\n\n\nMy question is, do I have any legal recourse here. My wife and I are preparing to apply for a mortgage soon, and while her credit score is immaculate, the reporting of this invalid debt is hurting mine, and thus could cost us money when it comes to the interest rate we qualify for.\n\n\nThe contract is black and white and I don't see how it's legal for them to knowingly report a false debt. Their dealership, or agent acting on their behalf, prepared the paperwork and told me where to sign. They're the professionals who do this every day. If anything, GM Financial should take this up with that dealership, not me.\n\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated.

I had 5 years of service before I started with my former school in early 2017. They took 15 months to complete the intrafund transfer with much pestering from me (already ridiculous.)  Inactive pension accounts expire after two years.  Right before this time period was up (June 2018) the transfer went through.  I received certification from the state that the transfer was completed with a date of March 2017 (so I was only actually inactive for 8 months) and that my deductions and 15 months of back deductions would begin in June 2018.  From that date on, the deductions were coming out of each paycheck, in the correct amounts, under line items clearly denoting pension contribution and back pension contribution. \n\nI left that school this past June and took a job at in a different district for September.  At that point, I thought my biggest issue was waiting for another transfer and making sure I was putting money aside for the 2 remaining back payments, plus the back payments i would have to make after the transfer went through.  In October, the payroll department alerted me to the fact that they were having difficulty because they couldn't find an account in my name.  It seems that even though I was making these contributions, the state wasn't receiving them.  My account expired.  The state most likely sent a notice to a previous address.  I have had to enroll in new account.  Expired accounts lose all rights and privileges connected to that account - I've lost my tier, my retirement is pushed back, and I would have to purchase 7.5 years of service credits at much higher rates.

Obviously, I will continue to push for answers.  Where did my money go?  Where did THEIR required 3% employer contribution go?  Participation for the teacher pension fund in NJ is NOT optional.   I will try and appeal the expiration of my account with the state.  However, if that cannot be undone, then I feel that the my former employer owes me the money they took from my paychecks, the 3% they were supposed to contribute over 28 months, payment for my service credits, and whatever is fair damages for pushing back my retirement (loss of tier).

He was already getting noticeably forgetful and living in disgusting conditions (like mold and fruitflies everywhere) when he lost his job 3 years ago, so it's hard to blame all of his current situation on his job loss. However, once he lost his job, he completely gave up in life and stopped taking care of himself or doing basically anything proactive I begged him to do to help his situation. I begged him to start investing in home repairs and cleaning services so he could sell his home and downsize, as he clearly could no longer afford to continue living there. Instead, he used his severance pay to buy things like new cars and expensive dinners with women he met on dating sites. I begged him to apply to new jobs or come up with some other plan instead of sticking his fingers in his ears and saying \"lalala\" while his bank account dwindled and his world burnt around him...he made every excuse why he couldn't and refused to take any jobs he felt were beneath him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEventually, it got to a point where his bank account was down to zero and he was looking at imminent homelessness. Around this time, I also began medical school, and he started calling me guilting me to let him \"borrow\" a few hundred here and there from my student loans. He also screwed me over on several financial situations where there were still financial strings attached that I am still struggling to deal with while trying to make it thru med school at the same time, but I won't go into the complexities of all of that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThankfully, last August, he got accepted for disability. I don't know for what or how he managed, but he was shockingly accepted super quickly once he actually took the initiative to apply (I and other family members begged him for about a year to do at least that much if he refused to get a new job). He now receives just short of $3000 a month in disability benefits, making him ineligible for many other forms of assistance and rightly so...$36K a year is plenty for one person imo. Except his health and living conditions are now at an all-time low to what seems to be the point of no return. He makes no sense about half of the time when you talk to him...he will repeat the same thing he's already said to you 30 times that day or start talking incoherently about how he met his sister when he took a class with her or how he wants to go skydiving so he can catch shrimp from the ocean. He goes literal months without bathing or washing the clothes he is wearing. I refuse to even go inside his house anymore because the second I walk in there, my eyes begin burning and watering from whatever is in the air. He smells absolutely putrid whenever I am around him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Christmas, I drove him to my sister's place where we were doing Christmas since we obviously can't do it at his house. My car still wreaks of him. While we were at her place, my sister lifted up his pant legs to find giant, festering sores all over his legs and massive leg swelling. The whole time we were there, he repeated himself and said things that made zero sense. My sister, who cleaned his leg sores, wound up getting violently ill shortly after we left, she suspects from getting something along the lines of Staph food poisoning from bacteria from the wounds getting into her food.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI took him to a low-income clinic when we got back, as he is not eligible for Medicare/Medicaid and insists that despite his $3K in benefits a month, he is basically penniless. They got him on some meds and an antibiotic he'd really been needing but can only do so much. I've gone to social security and various other agencies trying to get him help, but there just really aren't any programs in place for a 62 year old who starts developing dementia for no apparent reason, is living in such filth his home could probably be condemned, and whose children are all financially unable to support him. The fact that he's already getting so much in disability (yet insists he has no money to pay for anything that might improve his situation) further limits options.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn top of all of this, I have my boards for med school coming up and my stress levels from that alone are through the roof. I've had more panic attacks that I care to admit. If I fail my boards because I am spending all of my time and mental energy on his situation, that would only make everything 100x worse financially and otherwise. Leaving med school to care for him would similarly be a disaster for many reasons. I don't really have any current skills to fall back on and could, at best, get something like a waitressing job. It goes without saying that my entire future would be radically altered as well. There is also a history of domestic abuse at his hands that makes me further reluctant to sacrifice my entire future to care for him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this point, I'm really wanting to just throw up my hands and block the entire situation out, at least until I finish my boards. I am just worried I could wind up in some sort of legal trouble for doing so. A family member says I could be arrested for neglect. He is also, even in his demented state, very manipulative, and I would not at all put it past him to tell a social worker or somebody that I and/or my siblings are abusing him in any number of ways he invents in his head, as he's already tried telling doctors he doesn't want to live with my sister who offered him her guest bedroom because she \"yells at him.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm sorry this is so long.

During this time period he lost his job (was arrested multiple times over the period of two months and once happened while he was at work) and consequently was evicted from the house we lived in. \n\nHe took all of his stuff and any thing I didn\u2019t take when I went to CPS and put it in a storage unit and moved around with friends until he ultimately went to prison. During this time, he made my sister (then I believe 18) and I power of attorney over his bank account and storage unit. Mine didn\u2019t come into effect until I turned 18 a year ago. Basically he, my sister, and I were the only ones allowed access to the unit and we were the only ones allowed to make changes to the account (change gate code, the lock, etc)\n\nHis dad was paying the monthly payments until he recently fell ill and warned me in the coming months he\u2019d stop paying it.

I live in Louisiana, and I was a retail department manager for the same company for 2 years. In the second year, I never used my vacation time and had accrued almost 30 hours. In June of 2019 I announced that I was going to drop down in my position to pursue my own personal business, but wasn't sure if I was going to drop down to a part time sales associate or a full time team lead. I would lose my health insurance if I dropped down to the SA, so that was the major issue I was struggling with.  I was approved by the district manager to take all of July off to deal with things with my business and then make my decision on staying.  Unbeknownst to me, my boss, the store manager, changed my pay rate the day I left to the Team Lead position of $12/hour even though it wasn't decided what position I would be returning at. July 28th, I told them that I would be returning as a part time sales associate ($9/hour), and need to get the proof of my insurance ending so I can get new coverage outside of open enrollment. My boss said he couldn't provide the proof of loss of coverage and couldn't get the benefits department to give it to me either. Just said I would get something in the mail when it ended. Well, a couple of months go by and I keep following up with my physical therapist (who I see 2x a week), and they say my policy is still active. So I keep going. I realize I wasn't paid out my vacation time, so I get back in touch with the district manager who starts looking into the issue. Turns out, I was paying for my insurance out of my vacation time for a few months, so it was never paid out in cash. She talks to the benefits department and determines they will pay me out that week. Here's the kicker, the REGIONAL manager says he doesn't feel comfortable paying me out at my $17/hour rate that I worked for 2 years because it was apparently changed in the system by my boss to $12/hour, even though I have never worked at the company for $12/hour. I have a full email conversation of the benefits department saying I needed to be paid out at my old rate, and them saying they \"aren't comfortable\". I said screw it, I don't think thats legal and theres no HR department for the company, but I didn't want to add fuel to the fire. Fast forward to now, I got a call from my psychologist saying the insurance was terminated July 28th, and I owe them $400. I also get a call from my physical therapist for the same reason, saying I owe them $1800.

They have 2 dogs, both medium sized (unsure of breed but as far as I can tell not an \"aggressive\" breed (I.e Pit bull). Both dogs are left unattended most of the day in their backyard which is separated by a fence between our yard and theirs. These dogs constantly, and I mean CONSTANTLY bark. All day, every day, even throughout the night. If they hear a footstep outside they go wild and don't calm down for hours. This is an issue as I have a dog as well. My dog is trained well, avoids the fence, and never barks, but once again just the footsteps of him outside is enough to set them off.\n\nAll the neighbors in this subdivision have noticed the dogs as well, and we have all politely approached the property/dog owner and politely ask that they make an attempt to keep their dogs from barking so much (yes I understand you can't magically control dogs, the point is there are options on at least trying to minimize it, like supervision for example.). The owners responded politely the first few times and said they would make a strong effort to correct the issue, but soon became bitter and insisted that they were doing everything they could (although I'm usually home most of the time and they have not changed routine since we started talking). \n\nAfter a while we all began calling our local animal control dept to see if they had any suggestions. They insisted we continue to try to resolve things amongst ourselves, and we again tried to communicate the issue with the neighbor in question, but again no resolution. We now have contacted animal control dozens of times to file complaints, and by we I mean at least me and 5 other neighbors surrounding this house. Every time they say they will log the complaint but they never do much more than that. \n\nAfter 3 years of this, I am absolutely sick and tired of listening to barking 24/7 365 days a year because they can't stand outside while their dog goes to the bathroom for 10 minutes and at least make an effort to keep them from barking so much, and I would really like a resolution here. No I do not want their dogs taken away or put down, but maybe if someone were to issue a citation or something it might persuade them to do some more in terms of keeping it down, but as I said animal control and our local PD seem to have no interest. \n\nAny ideas for recourse here would be much appreciated.

I have a full-time day job, as well as family obligations, so I work fairly irregularly, which is pretty typical with my independent contractor status and the industry as a whole.\n\nOn Dec. 31st, I got a text message from one of the managers telling me that I had to turn in all my \"funny money\" that night or it would be forfeit, on the orders of the club owners. Strip club \"funny money\" is basically scrip -- at this club, whenever customers pay for a VIP room or a private dance on credit card, the club charges them an additional 20% credit card \"service fee\", and pays the dancers with an IOU to be redeemed later at 90% face value. For example, a private dance is $150; if the customer puts it on credit card, he gets charged $180. The club takes an additional cut and the dancer gets $90 in funny money, which, when redeemed, is actually only $81 in actual cash. Oh, and the dancers are expected to tip out the security/ \"VIP hosts\" from that. Yeah, it's bullshit.\n\nSo, I had to hurry my ass into the city to exchange the $1059 I had in strip club funny money, mostly in $20 and $1 denominations. I had 3 $100 bills. When I got there, they told me they'd stopped accepting the $100 denominations either a week, 2 weeks, or a month ago depending on who I talked to. (I last worked the weekend of Thanksgiving, so about a month ago, and I hadn't heard anything about that policy then.) So I could only turn in $759, thus getting $683 for my work. The reason was that the $100 denoms were now officially \"expired and withdrawn from from circulation,\" which seems super bullshit considering there's no expiration date printed on them, and I wasn't informed about the possiblity of these things ever expiring. No earlier text message from management, no signs in the dressing room... Nothing.\n\n$300 is not a life changing amount of money for me, but it's certainly enough to make me feel pretty cranky, especially considering that $300 was after the club took their 50% cut. This practice is fairly common in the industry, but this is the first time I've heard about funny money \"expiring\".  There's a half-ass disclaimer printed on the bill that says \"This bill can only be used for table dances, [private] rooms, tipping dancers and staff\". \n\nOther strip clubs treat scrip like this as a gift card, which from my understanding, cannot expire until 5 years after activation under federal law. According to what I've found on Google, an IOU under any other form (gift certificates and credit memos) is legally valid for 5 years, so telling me without warning that I can no longer redeem my money is pretty bullshit. What legal recourse do I have? I'm pretty sure if I try to file small claims or something, I'll get fired and I'll lose future opportunities to earn money at that particular establishment.", "title": "(Washington DC) My strip club refuses to pay me the money it owes, saying the IOU is \"expired\""}, {"created_utc": 1578157700, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/ejz7mm/i_loaned_a_close_friend_a_substantial_sum_of_us/", "id": "ejz7mm", "is_self": true, "score": 23, "selftext": "Between October 2017 and April 2019, I periodically lent a close friend of mine cryptocurrency (BTC and ETH).

For reference, I am in the US in Oregon.\n\nI've worked for a small company (less than 20 employees) since fall of 2018. I started in a very minor position and after expressing to my boss (our CEO) that I felt like I was capable of more, I slowly worked my way up and was transitioned to a new position on September 1, 2019. In October 2019 I asked my boss (our CEO/owner) about the possibility of a raise as I had taken on many job responsibilities in my new position with no pay adjustment. It began a very troubling next few months in which he said some incredibly hurtful and inappropriate things to me. I discussed the matter with my direct supervisor and our \"HR\" person (not legally trained in HR and has no past experience in HR, but she is designated as our HR person). Essentially nothing happened after this, but my supervisor assured me that I am doing a great job and to just keep moving forward and said that the possibility of a raise would be discussed when all employees had our reviews in January. There was never any resolution with the CEO and he refused to apologize to me. Things continued to be very award with us, but he lives out of state and I didn't see him much.\n\nDecember came and it was our busiest month of the year. I worked a ton of overtime, in addition to working weekends and times when I'm not normally scheduled (I typically work 30 hour weeks). I worked my ass off and was continually told I was doing a great job given how crazy busy we were.\n\nThe company gives us time off the week between Christmas &amp; New Years, so my first day back at work was January 2nd. I come in that morning to an email from our boss/ceo/owner that he will be flying in for employee reviews on Friday (Jan 3rd) and gives a schedule of who will go at what time.\n\nUnrelated to anything prior, I decided to disclose my pregnancy (10 weeks) to our HR person before the end of day. My thought was that it would be good for her to be able to talk to our CEO while he was here because he isn't in very often. There is no maternity leave policy in place and so I wanted to let them know early enough for them to decide what the policy would look like. She is happy and excited for me and lets me know that she will start working with our CEO on a policy.\n\nI have no reason to be scared I will be losing my job. I've had no work related performance issues, I'm on time and I do my work well, and as far as I know things are great. I've loved my job, my coworkers, and I've loved the company that I work for.\n\nMy review was with our CEO/owner and our \"HR\" yesterday. He essentially leads the entire meeting, telling me that I was a great find for the company, came at just the right time when I did (called me a \"miracle\"), and then proceeds to say that my role is has not become what he wanted it to be and rather than letting me go back to my old position, they are going to \"phase me out\". This was a confusing way of putting it because they told me that was my last day, not to come in next week, but they would pay me for two more weeks of work in addition to what I'm owed for hours worked in January. He keeps saying that the main reason is because they think I would be happier somewhere else. Our HR person chimes in to say that if i want to come in for a lunch to \"honor me\" they can arrange for that. The ceo/owner tells me that I probably have a lot of questions, but he says he doesn't want me to ask any of them now and that I can call/email him later with any questions or concerns that I may have. The whole thing felt very weird to me, but I was also very emotional and visibly upset.\n\nThis whole thing has me shocked and extremely scared.

I discovered this moments before leaving for a family function and my father talked me out of taking him to the ER, which I now regret very much. The damage healed by morning \u2014 it was not severe, no blood or anything. That night my daughter woke up screaming incoherently and when I finally calmed her down she told me she had a dream about running away from a game she didn\u2019t want to play, but adamantly refused to describe the dream. \n\nI called the child abuse hotline and reported this event. They took down the report, but called back to say it wasn\u2019t enough to do anything about, which I already knew was going to happen. \n\nLast month, December, I told my daughter I was going to tuck her shirt in and she replied \u201cokay, but don\u2019t touch me down there\u201d. Finding this highly suspicious, I asked her \u201chas anyone been touching you down there?\u201d and she responded \u201cYes, but the person said they didn\u2019t do it, so I don\u2019t remember who it was.\u201d\n\nThey\u2019re both severely regressing on potty training. My daughter has started coming home from school in changed clothes 2-4 times a week due to urine accidents, and twice now has also had poop accidents. My son peed himself four times today, twice while out with his father and twice since coming home, and also pooped on the bathroom floor, which is just completely unlike him \u2014 he potty trained himself way back in April and almost never has any accidents. He\u2019s also become completely terrified of having his butt wiped after pooping, screaming, trying to run away, and hitting me. \n\nA quick google search tells me such accidents are linked to pelvic floor dysfunction from sexual abuse. The study also indicated that visible trauma to the child\u2019s genitals is rare, \u201can exception not the rule\u201d. This is very disappointing to me because back in 2018 when I was working with child sexual assault professionals they tried to convince me it was very unlikely anything is happening because my daughter did not have significant trauma to her genitals. Because of things she has said and done, I\u2019m confident she was abused, and now my son is being abused too, and despite my best efforts the verbal child won\u2019t talk about what\u2019s happening. \n\nI have been repeatedly advised by legal professionals that the absolute only way to move forward with charging him is for my daughter to speak clearly and \u201cwith explicit language\u201d about what is happening. I\u2019ve also been advised that I cannot teach her that language or coach her on what to say (and I have *strictly* followed that rule all along). The detective that handled the case in 2018 told me to wait until she is in sex ed in school and she will probably provide useable information then. This is completely unacceptable to me. I cannot keep living knowing I am delivering my children to be molested by a monster. \n\nAs far as I can tell from googling laws my state (Maine) does not allow me to send them bugged with a camera or mic and have the footage be usable in any way. I have also been unable to find any sort of camera/mic that would be useful in our situation \u2014 it needs to be able to be inconspicuously worn on the 5.5 year old.", "title": "My children (5.5 and 2) are being molested by their father and my efforts to get legal help with this issue are failing.

My dog was also startled and barked at the man, but she immediately backed up. She showed no aggression other than that one bark (if that's even considered aggression). At this point the man lifted his shirt to reveal a pistol and places his hand on it and started yelling that he'll blow my dog's head off. I apologize for nearly bumping into him; however, he continues to yell and won't de-escalate. At this point I threaten to call the cops and he starts to physically back off, but becomes verbally defensive. He says he has a right to carry a gun and defend himself and that I'd only call the cops because he's black. He walked to his car and drove away.

I wish I didn't have to post this but I am in desperate need of advice.\n\nI currently rent a 2 bedroom apartment in Queens. I used to rent with my brother, who was in charge of paying the rent through a third party website (this is what we're all told to pay through by the leasing office). In May he left the lease and I picked up the responsibility while my new roommates pays me his share in cash.\n\nI have noticed no bill we receive is ever the same as what is listed on the lease. Every month it's $20-100 more than my rent, once it was even $200 more. I have been on the phone with the rental office countless times with them about it, and I've been getting the run around. I've been told these are 'building improvement/maintenance fees' that I simply have to pay. Not only that, but when I pay through he website, I ALWAYS have a balance the next month. I was told this was an error on the site's part and that they 'couldn't' do anything about, because sometimes the fees are processed late (????)' and that to simply make sure I pay what is listed on my physical bill and/or call them.\n\nSo, I am incredibly done with this. Last month I made 1000% sure I had a 0 balance (0 balance on the third party site, and I called them directly to confirm the 0 balance). Then I paid through the site the EXACT rent charge I was billed in the mail, regardless of the number on the third party site, JUST like they told me. Then, this month, I'm told I have a $50 balance somehow! It won't say WHAT. it is. No one can seem to tell me what it is exactly.\n\nNone of these fees are itemized, and often times they are literally hidden in a single 'rent' charge that is an inflated number of what I agreed to on my lease. Is this illegal? How am I responsible for building improvements when I'm just a renter and have no stake in the building? help!!\n\nEdit: I am not at home right now so I can't re-read my lease just now, I will as soon as I get home. I am scared there's something in the fine print I missed that will basically mean I'm screwed. Even if there is a clause telling me to pay all these fees, wouldn't that be an illegal clause? They charge tenants for maintenance/improvements, then get tax deductions on said maintenance/improvements, aren't they essentially making a profit?\n\neven if you don't have in depth advice, please someone tell me if I'm right in being suspicious here or if I'm overreacting/don't have a case.

My family explained to her why this was a terrible idea and suggested she go to a family shelter so she could get proper assistance (she's on disability for mental health issues). She refused and was insistent on going with no car , no money and ultimately no real destination with the children.

My husband is a store manager. A few weeks ago, one of his assistant managers said she hated her job and quit. It's necessary to note that this person, D, was the victim of sexual assault by the previous manager. That manager was immediately fired upon investigation by my husband, and has just been sentenced to jail time. Anyway, so D quit without notice. Another assistant, S, tried to convince D to come back because S didn't like the extra work she had to do until D could be replaced. My husband said no. D said only with a raise, which my husband said no to. She didn't ask for a raise before she quit, she just left. \n\nFor the past 2 weeks, D has been spending a lot of time in the store during S's shifts. They've been overheard by at least 4 other employees plotting to get my husband fired. S has been caught on security camera undoing work my husband does, like making a mess of stock and taking down posted schedules. Then she photographs the mess or makes a huge deal of \"fixing his mistakes\". There is video evidence of her doing this. I'm not overly concerned about any of that, because of the evidence. On one video you literally watch my husband put up a schedule as he is leaving work and less than 5 minutes later S tears it down, shreds it, prints a new copy, signs her name, and walks away. My husband is a great manager. So good, hes been sent to other stores that are struggling to help them get better and he is in talks to start a training store for other managers. He is amazing at his job. \n\nNow that you've got the back story, here's the part where I need legal advice. S and D managed to get my husbands district manager to call a meeting about bringing D back on staff. That meeting is today. 2 days ago, S and D were overheard making plans to get D's 16yo cousin A, an employee, to accuse my husband of sexual assault. A is the one that told my husband, she does NOT want to or plan to go along with this. She is majorly upset they are trying to do this. The two other employees that overheard S and D making plans actually overheard D suggest to S that they accuse my husband of assaulting A. S asked if he actually did. D laughed and said of course not, but I can make her lie about it. They corned A at work to try and force her into. That's also on video, although there is no audio. A is devastated and scared no one will believe it didnt happen. Here's my problem. We've got 2 kids, one of which is a little girl, the other a boy with special needs. If their lies were taken seriously we could lose our kids. They are trying to destroy my family just for a job. It's not even a great paying job, my husband makes less than $50 grand a year. Every single other female employee is VOLUNTEERING with out being asked to make statements that nothing inappropriate has ever happened. Some of his former coworkers have become good friends and say he is always very careful. He is well aware of the current situation of any woman being believed, so he makes sure theres nothing to be misinterpreted. \n\nMy questions: if they go through with their accusations, even if the regional manager doesn't believe them, what should we expect and what are our legal options?

She convinced us that it was a matter of public safety, and we should report it somehow. So we filed a claim with the grocer's health department and waited to hear back. They gave us a bit of a run around, transfering us from one 'adjuster' to the next. Eventually they requested we send the tooth to them in the mail for analysis.

Their insurance agent offered us $250 dollars and wanted to close the case.\n\nPersonally I was stunned that they offered us money. My fiancee and her mother urged me to not take it. They are worried that the company is just trying to pay us off and sweep the situation under the rug. As far as I know, there will be no recall of products and no further investigation.\n\nI guess my main question is: do we have a moral obligation to keep pushing the claim until this company takes some sort of actionable responsibility for the incident?

After I was hired, I was informed I\u2019d be a sales person working within a big bulk-buy chain. I would be selling products belonging to a well-known cell service as well as another well-known cable service. I was nervous about this but wanted to prove myself because they promised so much money if I kept at it. \n\nAs a sales associate, I would only make $60 per sale, whereas my manager would make $250 for every sale I or another associate would make. Sales associates would either get an hourly pay (which was lower than the minimum wage in the area we were selling) or the money from our sales- we would get whichever was more. There was a clear order of sales associates at the bottom, then assistant managers, then managers, then corporate positions. \n\nWe would have weekly meetings that would last about an hour and a half. The first hour would be our manager telling us how much money he makes (he said $9k a week) and how we could be like him if we kept at it. The whole first hour every week was spent on this. The last half hour would be team building activities, practicing pitches, etc. We would have monthly calls from the CEO about literally the same thing as the first hour of the meeting. The calls were mandatory but we could not clock in for them. \n\nWe didn\u2019t have to pay any start-up fees, but we did have to buy our own wifi hotspots on our phones so we could have internet to be able to sign customers up for the service. \n\nNow comes the pay problem. I was only being paid about $125 every week. Nowhere near what I was promised. I also didn\u2019t get any paychecks or direct deposits til about a month into the job. Another associate, who had just quit before I was hired, wasn\u2019t paid for 6 weeks and was evicted because she couldn\u2019t pay rent.

We shut down a few weeks ago due to COVID-19,  and my company continued to pay us until March 27, making vague  promises and plans to have us start up telehealth this week.

Long time reader, first time kvetcher.  I always wondered when something would happen in my personal life to get me to post here.\n\nSo I don't have the talent in MS Paint that some other posters do, but the setup is pretty simple.  My mother lives in a home in a planned housing development and her home is on a row on the exterior of the overall property being developed. Behind her is a large drainage which is probably 200-300' wide or so.\n\nSix months ago my mom moved into a new house and it's been pretty nice.  However, in the last few weeks she's been hearing sounds from the woods across the drainage behind her house.  She asked the neighbors about the sounds and they told her that it was a neighbor living over that way who likes to shoot wild pigs, rabbits, squirrels and other assorted varmints.  Apparently they've all gotten used to this.\n\nFor the last month my mom tells me she occasionally hears something hit her house but could never figure out what.  One night last week she's on her back porch eating dinner when she hears asshole neighbor shooting and then hears the \"thing hitting her house\" sound after which a small piece of metal lands on her table.  She takes it to friendly neighbor (next-door) later who tells her it's a 22 caliber bullet.\n\nAfter soliciting everyone in the world for advice she calls the police.  A police officer arrives, asks her some questions, and then at the end tells her that she probably won't like what he's going to tell her, but since asshole neighbor is shooting guns on his own property he's legally in the clear.  Police officer leaves and my mom talks to the growing crowd of friendly neighbors around her house wondering what's going on.  She talks about it and they confirm her story.  Apparently the police have been getting complaints for years about bullets hitting homes and never do anything because multiple neighbors have had the same thing happen before.\n\nI really can't believe that my mother doesn't have any recourse here.  She hasn't been hurt or injured but why would we wait for that to happen?  She lives in a neighborhood with lots of young families as well.\n\nHere's the challenge: my mom loves to solicit advice but is terrible at following it.  Afer the bullet incident she called about seven different people (not including me, for some reason) asking them what she should do.  Every single person suggested she should call the police.  She did call them after all other seven people told her to, although it's probably just because she ran out of other people to call and not because she thought the advice she'd gotten was sound.

The actual repossession was done legally as far as I can tell (no locks broken, no disturbance created, etc...). The issue I have and why I am posting here is the fact that I had a large amount of tools ($1000+) in the trunk of her car; I was fixing her car while she was visiting and I was too lazy to walk them back into my apartment when I finished working that night, that is why the tools  were in her vehicle.\n\nAt first we thought her car was stolen, but after contacting the police we found out what had truly happened; my friend was quite embarrassed and very apologetic about my tools, personally I was in disbelief that a company would repossess a car during the current situation (COVID-19) but I digress. So it was 1 AM when we discovered the missing vehicle I attempted calling the Repossession company immediately but there was no answer. So the next day as soon as the Repossession Agent's place of business opened I got in contact with them and explained the situation; this is where I have a problem. They said that I could get my belongings if I paid $60 dollars, got the keys from my friend, and had my friend sign a note saying she authorizes me to pick up my stuff.\n\nNow I understand that in California the Repossession Agent can charge a fee for my friend's belongings which would have been the $60 dollars ($50 processing fee + $10 per day). But I am a third party I had no involvement in her not paying nor did I have any contract with her lending company. So from my perspective the Repossession Agent took my things without permission and then charged me to get them back; one could say stole my goods and then ransomed the goods back to me.\n\nI was worried about getting my tools back and I needed them to work so I was pressed into making a hasty decision; I tried contacting a few attorneys before I left but none of them were helpful; either they didn't know or did not want to express their opinion on the legality nor could they really offer advice about thy type of lawyer I should be contacting.\n\nSo I went with the \"it is not that much money to get my stuff back plan\" and drove 2 hours to the place they were storing the car and paid the $60. The entire situation was very sketchy not only did they make me wait 20 minutes in a not so nice area of town but when they did arrive they did nothing to alleviate my uneasiness due to the way they were acting; I was very uncertain what I was walking into. I did mention that I didn't think I should have to pay the $60 and they said either pay or they wouldn't take me to the car to get my tools. I did manage to make a hand written receipt that I got one of them to sign and I sneaked one picture of the individuals while leaving; but I didn't record anything because I was worried about the two party consent laws in CA that I was researching on my way to meet the Repossession Agent.\n\nSo the question(s) I have are as follows:\n\n1) As an innocent 3rd party should I have been required to pay to get my belongings (tools) back? (not to mention being required to bring my friends keys as well)\n\n2) What area of specialty should I be looking for in a lawyer if I were to pursue this? Assuming the answer is \"no\" to the first question. \n\n3) Could this be just cause for my friend to say that the Repossession Agent did not follow the rules and therefore it was a wrongful repossession? (It would be nice to be able to help her out)\n\nI am very uncertain about the legality of this situation and my googling has done nothing to help with that. So I would be very grateful to anyone that might be able to offer some insight into this situation; with that in mind I want to say thank you in advance for any advice that anyone may provide.", "title": "My belongings were in a friends car that got repossessed."}, {"created_utc": 1586625173, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/fza5dz/my_uncle_wants_to_leave_his_awful_wife_but_she/", "id": "fza5dz", "is_self": true, "score": 11, "selftext": "Hi, this is my first post so please lmk if im missing any info.\nMy Uncle is leaving in Southern California.

My boss found numerous ways to pay us as little as possible, for example by:\n\n(1) not paying us for initial consultations with clients that took hours of professional time and effort, since by boss's logic these visits weren't the \"actual service;\"\n\n(2) not responding to our emails when we would say a recurring service necessarily took longer than the original scheduled time, preventing us from getting paid for our whole time spent performing quality service (she arranges pay directly with clients and could have easily arranged with the client to extend the time of service to match how long we were actually working to complete the client's tasks while client was away from home);\n\n(3) \"forgetting\" to pay my roommate on time, violating the contract, though roommate didn't do anything about it and was just happy to get paycheck eventually;\n\n(4) various other questionable, unethical, and possibly illegal methods.\n\nI also suspected she was withholding taxes from our pay, which from my knowledge she shouldn't do since we were independent contractors.\n\nFed up with this behavior, I quit. I was struggling with a re-emerging disability at the time and couldn't make the two-hour (unpaid, of course) trip on foot to boss's house to return all clients' keys. I was eager to return them, and offered to have boss make a 15-minute or so drive to my house or have roommate prove that the keys are now in roommate's and therefore another independent contractor's possession, but my boss refused these options and refused to pay me. I was then financially broke and couldn't even afford food, let alone public transit or anything, at that point.\n\nFinally, I unintentionally hinted that I already already moved out of state: I just said that I \"didn't have the resources\" to travel to return the keys myself, even though as always she was invited to get them or accept them as in my roommate's possession, and she assumed that I had already moved. (I was planning to move at the time, and thanks to outside support I am now living in another state.) She finally gave up and accepted the keys as in my roommate's possession, exchanging pictures of the keys over email to verify, talking to my roommate explicitly about how I was being a burden.\n\nBut, as an act of final revenge it seems, she withheld my pay for days right up until the deadline. (I had already mentioned our contract and getting myself a lawyer at that point even though I knew I had no money, so she knew I was aware of the pay deadline listed on the contract.) I remember having nothing to eat and being behind on rent, my disability affecting me physically and psychologically.\n\nOnce I got paid, I thought about what I could do, but didn't know what to do. I emotionally blocked it out of my mind and moved on. However, while doing my 2019 taxes the other week, I remembered. I looked up how her business was doing, and apparently my old boss is trying to convince the government to allow her business to be considered essential even though 99+% of its existence relies on when clients travel and work away from home, and of course the service itself isn't essential, but rather a luxury.\n\nI know it's been a year, but I feel horrible knowing that many of the independent contractors are young people who are more likely to be financially taken advantage of. Specifically, I still feel I should do something regarding how I was treated. The company is a national network of local owners, and I couldn't find any central office to which I could report my boss's=local owner's behavior.\n\nIs there any legal way in which I can file a complaint? I've had trouble finding information, since I wasn't technically an \"employee.\"\n\n(Btw I have a great, legally essential job now and am doing well. I hate thinking about these times.)\n\nP.S.

I briefly lived with him (my lease ended and he seemed normal and offered), but moved out after 3 months when I realized he was not at all who I thought he was. I will call him James.   \n   \nA few of the the things he did during our relationship:   \n    \n-prescribed medication to me for himself... I was not ok with this, but he would guilt me that he needed ambien or benzos to sleep because he was an ED physician with a difficult schedule and I couldn\u2019t possibly understand what it\u2019s like to work as hard as him   \n  \n-sometimes he would call it into the pharmacy and pick it up himself, I\u2019d only know because the pharmacy would text that my prescription was ready   \n   \n-recorded videos during sex without my knowledge or consent (this comes into play later)   \n   \n-prescribed medication to other friends and family to fuel his addiction. He would go through a 30 day supply of ambien in about 10 days, so he had a group of people he knew when their prescriptions were up for refill (30 day requirement) and he would call in more and have them pick it up and give it to him   \n   \n-purchasing and using cocaine. At first this was rare (at least hidden to me), but towards the end of our relationship he was purchasing around $300 worth (don\u2019t know the amount of cocaine that is) A WEEK and using it. Also, I never saw him use cocaine before working, he would only do it when he was off work for a couple of days; however, he did prescribe adderall to a friend and they spilt the script monthly.    \n   \nOK, So.... he was a very threatening/manipulative person and I\u2019m so glad to have just gotten away. He would beg me not to report him and would say \u201chow could you throw away 14 years of my life like that??!\u201d ..referring to college, med school, residency, and fellowship. The year we dated was his first year as an attending physician.  After I broke up with him, he harassed me and this dragged on far too long (which I am also at fault for playing into that at times, hoping he\u2019d get help and get better). He would call my family and ramble on to them about how they don\u2019t really know me, just an all around crazy person. After a couple of months separated, while still being harassed, I went to the police and reported him to the medical board online. The police contacted James, told him not to contact me, he got a lawyer and seemed to be listening to his/her advice.   \n   \nFast forward 3 months. A girl that James was dating/hooking up with (while still begging to get back together with me) asked if she could call me., I will call her Emily. They worked together at a hospital (which is also my previous place of employment, but I now work for a different hospital system, because of him). Emily informed me that while James was high (on ambien, cocaine, or whatever) he texted another coworker of theirs, trying to get her to hook up with him. Emily had a tumultuous relationship with James as well. I actually told her a lot of these things before, but she didn\u2019t listen. Emily also informed me that she now knew everything I told her before was true and she was no longer dating him or interested at all. It also turns out that in addition to asking the other coworker to hook up, James had sent her nude photos of Emily and a screenshot of a video of me.   \n   \nThis made me so angry because I felt like I was finally moving on with my life without him. Together, Emily and I told his boss at work and we also contacted a lawyer. The lawyer seemed to have more of a specialty in sexual harassment/employment law. We talked at length during a conference and we both revealed times he had drugged us and had sex with us. I didn\u2019t report this to the police when it happened, because I was afraid of him and he would tell me he would ruin my life because he has money and I don\u2019t. There are several instances that Emily and I can both say we were probably raped, but it\u2019s honestly so awful to think about and recall that the thought of having to bring it up to police and possibly in court is nauseating.   \n   \nSO after we reported the photos (with proof) to his boss, he lost his job. The lawyer we met with essentially told us there\u2019s nothing they can do (civil side) and we should report to the police, but we didn\u2019t, for the reasons stated above.   \n  \n**Fast forward to now.** About a week ago (a month after he lost his job), someone from the medical board reached out for their investigation. I told the investigator about the prescribing, the cocaine, and sending the photos leading to James losing his job. The investigator asked a lot of questions and I answered as much as I could. I provided dates and my prescription records and other names of people I knew he did this to. I gave her Emily\u2019s name and number, with her permission. I also told the investigator about an event where James told me he was giving me migraine medication (later found out it wasn\u2019t) and then he had sex with me and his friend participated. I was not ok with this, but James took a video and told me if I got him in trouble he\u2019d show the video and show that I didn\u2019t seem to say no. I have a very blurry memory from that night, but I do remember the cellphone flashlight on, while he was recording. I did not claim he raped me, as he\u2019s never been found guilty or even charged with a crime. She thanked me for the information.    \n   \nThe next day, Emily called me crying and told me she told the investigator everything and it was horrible to have to talk about. I agreed and about 30 minutes later the investigator called me back and informed me that she would have to report the incident to the police. I\u2019m freaking out, because I don\u2019t feel like talking to the police about this. I NEVER want to see that video and I worry I might have to if this gets investigated. I want a lawyer because I don\u2019t completely trust the police and if I do end up having to talk to them, I want to be protected and know my options. Since the police told him to not contact me, he has almost stopped entirely. I haven\u2019t heard from him in over a month and I don\u2019t think I can go through reliving that time in my life. It has already caused horrible anxiety. My first attempt at contacting a lawyer wasn\u2019t very helpful, is this not a legal issue at this point? Or is there another type of lawyer I should be reaching out to?   \n   \n**edit to add:** I do think he should get in trouble for this if the police believe there is enough to charge him. I fear going in and talking to them, because of horrible experiences I\u2019ve heard of from similar situations.

My landlord stores 3 vehicles and 2 motorcycles at the leased house in which I live. 2 cars and 2 motorcycles are stored in the garage. The last car (ranch truck) is stored outside in the backyard. Today my landlord and his 2 of his sons showed up unannounced, and proceeded to try and come collect the ranch truck they have. But one of my housemates who is currently back in his home town had his truck parked, blocking this ranch truck. I told them that the owner of said truck was not here, and that there was no way to move the car as the owner had the keys. One of the sons then proceeded to go under the car and manually push the gear box into neutral. At this point I became very uncomfortable and called my housemate who owns the truck. My housemate told me \u201cI am absolutely not okay and very uncomfortable with them touching my truck.\u201d I hung up the phone and told the son this. They didn\u2019t seem to care though and kept throwing out ideas of how to move it stating \u201cwe could just tow it, would that break it?\u201d...\u201dwhy don\u2019t we see if we can get a rope\u201d. Then they proceeded to try and squeeze the ranch truck by and decided there was no way, and that the space was too tight. I apologized and told them sorry. They left after this, and I thought it was the end. \n\nNo, they then proceeded to go and buy or find a rope and come back. I only discovered they had come back when I went outside and hear them trying to move the truck again. I have no idea if they successfully moved it but it appeared as if they had somewhat moved it back a little, and had a jack on the ground next to the truck. I went up to them and said \u201cHey, I thought we had an agreement\u201d to which the landlord said \u201cwhat agreement?\u201d. I then told him again about how the owner was not comfortable with them touching his truck. To which he replied \u201cwell do you know what I\u2019m not comfortable with? Wasting 6 hours of my time.\u201d To this I told him \u201cyou never sent us word or gave a heads up that you were coming,  and that if they would just text me ahead of time it would help avoid situations like this.\u201d When the landlord heard this he angrily threw all his stuff in his truck (the one they drove there in) and got inside. One of the sons lightly apologized to me and they left. I\u2019m really worried about them trying this while I\u2019m gone, I\u2019m currently the only one at the house. What should I do? Is this legal for them to try and move my housemates car without him present? \n\nI also have a video of them trying to squeeze  the car by and I know the house next to us has a camera that might have picked up the incident.

The results were... odd. The line basically cuts diagonally through the hedges. However, the trunks of the hedges are 100% on our side, which to me indicates that we own the hedges. Out front, on the street side, the endpoint stake is completely in his yard. In the backyard, the opposite stake is 100% in our yard. In a raised flower bed. Basically, if I am interpreting these markers correctly, they show that we own the hedge, but our neighbor owns a minuscule wedge of our backyard that includes a fraction of a raised flower bed and a little bit of grass. \n\nI have no idea what he intends to do with this info. But now that it\u2019s Spring I\u2019m gearing up for some yard work, and I\u2019d like to remove the ugly neon pink flag/stake in the middle of the flower bed.

The relationship between Sarah and Kate sours for whatever reason blah blah blah they're not on great terms. \n\nOne day after a morning argument Sarah begins receiving texts from Kate saying that her dog bit her.

When I learned of my exposure to the virus, I removed myself from the building immediately. My boss is now showing symptoms, and has told me my CEO \u201cis pissed you potentially exposed the office to the virus\u201d. I feel there was a strong implication I\u2019m about to get fired. \n\nLong post. I looked through the COVID-19 related FAQ thread but I didn\u2019t see anything that directly answered my question. If there is something that does, I\u2019ll remove this post and follow that guidance. \n\nI\u2019ll try to explain my situation as holistically as I can to provide context. \n\nI (22M) live in a 1000+ person large apartment complex with a roommate. He has been working from home since the beginning of the state-wise shelter in place order. \n\nI work for a small, defense industry business in PA (25 employees). We\u2019ve had a state-wide shelter in place order for the last couple weeks. We were deemed an essential business (DIB classification), for fulfilling law enforcement/government defense-related orders. My job responsibilities are certainly not essential to the operation of the business (I\u2019m an Engineer, everything I do is R&amp;D and new product development). I can perform my job responsibilities from a WFH setting. \n\nMy company culture can generally be described with the sentence \u201chighly conservative and aggressively anti-fact\u201d. I work with a lot of \u201ctruthers\u201d: mostly Infowars and OAN/Fox News consumers and people who would very much fit the definition of \u201cconspiracy theorists\u201d. My CEO and immediate boss are among those who could fit that definition. The phrase \u201cliberal conspiracy\u201d was thrown around the office a lot when the Coronavirus first started making its rounds in the news. Later these turned into phrases along the lines of \u201cthis is all way too overblown\u201d, \u201cthis doesn\u2019t apply to any of us\u201d, \u201cnone of this matters anyway\u201d, \u201cthere\u2019s already a cure\u201d \u201cthey legally can\u2019t shut us down\u201d....you get the picture. \n\nThe Monday after the shelter in place order was issued in my state (it was issued by the governor on a Friday) a memo was distributed company wide explaining how our business is an exempt business, and on it every single employee of the business was named \u201cessential for operation\u201d. Salespeople, the receptionist, engineers, technicians, warehouse shippers, janitors, marketing people, graphic designers: title didn\u2019t matter. All of us were named as essential to the operation of the business, to allow the business to fulfill the \u201cessential\u201d orders of the business. \n\nAlso distributed with the above memo was a single sheet of paper offering us a \u201cvoluntary 60 day furlough\u201d. We were explained how we could enter into this furlough and file for unemployment. During the furlough, we wouldn\u2019t get paid our salary, however our healthcare would still get paid for. Our CEO handed it out to each of us and we were asked to make our decision to take or not take the furlough on the spot. He also stated (without the ability to confirm his statement) \u201cnobody who works here or their family members have the virus\u201d. While it was not directly specified on this particular paper, it was heavily implied by our CEO we would be laid off and replaced as soon as possible if we decided to take the furlough. 1 person out of the 25 took the furlough. \n\nI feel I would be remiss if I didn\u2019t mention our retail orders have been booming recently from a rush of doomsday preppers ordering our product for their bunkers. Or in other words, the vast majority of the business coming in and orders being fulfilled has not been what the state would consider \u201cessential\u201d. \n\nWork from home was not immediately mentioned as an option in any memo or in any official recorded communications. We do, however, have 3 employees who  normally work from home remotely. When I asked personally if it was a possibility for more people to start working from home during the shelter in place order, I was told it would not be permitted unless I was demonstrably exposed to the virus. \n\nAfter this memo was distributed, our CEO stopped coming to work. He sheltered in place at his home and worked from home. Nobody else was allowed to do this. \n\n2 weeks ago, a second memo was distributed company wide by our CEO. In this memo, we were told we must self-isolate and stay at home if we, or anyone we lived with, began showing symptoms. \n\nSo last Thursday night (10 days ago), one of my friends I live on my floor with visited my apartment for late night drinks and a movie (I know, I know, but we stayed 6 feet apart the whole time). He was not showing any symptoms and claimed to be fully healthy. On Wednesday of this last week (4 days ago) this individual texted me and said he began showing symptoms the day after he was in my apartment, was administered a COVID-19 test on Monday (6 days ago), and received a positive test result back right before he texted me (2 days after he took the test). I immediately explained the situation about my exposure and showed these messages to my immediate boss, and he directed me to pack my office up and work from home. I left my office with my work from home materials within 45 mins of learning about my exposure. I emailed my CEO and got approval for this. I worked from home Thursday, and will work from home for this upcoming week. \n\nI had an elevated temperature for 1 day (Friday) and have not shown any symptoms of the virus before or since the day I had an elevated temperature. My roommate has not shown any symptoms. \n\nToday, I found out one of our marketing people started showing symptoms on Monday and also began working from home then, and additionally, my immediate boss (who used to call Coronavirus a liberal conspiracy) started showing symptoms on Friday as well. \n\nMy boss texted me today our CEO \u201cis pissed you potentially exposed the office to the virus\u201d. Ive seen him completely lose his shit in front of the entire company and scream/tantrum until blue in the face before, and I know he has a vengeful personality. \n\nWould my company legally be allowed to let me go over this?

Both are very fast, she ran inside to get her coat and shouted for me.  The dogs ran about a block and turned left, where we couldn't see.

He's an older dog, around 11, and the other is around 3.  We thought at first that he was struggling to keep up with the younger dog or he was hit by a car, and the adrenaline got him halfway home, until we noticed a little bit of blood on his paw.  We took him to an emergency vet, they treated him for shock and x-rayed him, and found what appeared to be a pellet lodged in his abdomen, they also found the entrance wound.

Do I get this money back?\nWhat can I do about the money she stole from my son\u2019s SSI account? I have a letter from the IRS stating that she was the one who received the payments but was given no direction in what to do with it? Is this a criminal court matter? What can I do about this? \n\nI feel like she practically bailed on my son and got to steal from him with no type punishment whatsoever.

A few months ago, I come downstairs one night to find that someone has parked his truck behind my car, blocking me into the spot so I can't get out. I call the towing company and have them come and move the truck a few feet. As I am about to leave, the owner of the truck comes down and starts to scream about the fact that I touched his car. I explain that he's not allowed to block people in. He continues to scream and calls the tow company to scream at them. They apparently tell him to go fly a kite. He hangs up the phone, still visibly enraged, gets into his car and waits until I pull out to follow me aggressively as leave the parking lot. I manage to lose him only when I get onto the highway.\n\nThis weekend, he left a huge dent in my door.\n\nI contacted the HOA who provided camera footage, but the footage is shoddy and doesn't capture the entire thing. The frame only gets the back end of my car and shows the guy getting out of his truck (parked next to mine), going back around to my car, then my car slightly move (as I assume he kicks/ knees the door), making the dent I later found.\n\nI live in this building and own my unit. This person doesn't live in our building. Once a week he visits a woman who rents here. The HOA has told me to go to the police and there is nothing else they can do, but they did give me the contact information of the woman he visits and the contact of the owners of the unit.\n\nMy concerns are: 1) If I call the police they won't give a shit, especially given the current health crisis, and 2) Even if they come and give the guy a warning it will only unhinge him more and he might do something worse. If I contact the woman or the owners, I don't know if they would be able or willing to do anything, and again, might only exacerbate things.\n\nIf I do nothing, I am still worried he will continue to cause damage to my car and/ or physically assault me.

Please excuse my English. It is not my first language.\n\nI moved into a house in Brooklyn in 2016. I was one of 4 people living there. My only written agreement was an email exchange between me and the owner (let\u2019s call her Jenna) saying I would pay $900/month to live there in one of the bedrooms plus a 900 security deposit.\n\nI lived there for almost 4 years, then got a letter in January from Jenna (who lived in Boston) saying she accepted a job in NYC and wanted to move back. She wanted us out by April. Fair enough. I made arrangements and moved. I made a video of my room, but not the common areas upon leaving showing the state it was in just to compare with the video I made upon moving in. My room is completely empty and in the state it was when I arrived. No damage. Same can be said about the common areas.\n\nJenna finally came back to look at the place and said she is surprised that there are still so many pieces of furniture in the house, as well as junk in the pantry and basement. I think she is right about he junk in the pantry and basement, but the furniture was all there when I moved in, and it is all in the common areas or other roommates rooms, but not mine.\n\nShe cites a dining room set, a piano, a couch, some nightstands and dressers in my roommates rooms. She says that if she has to get a junk removal crew to come get the stuff and have the house cleaned it will come out of the deposits split equally among all roommates.\n\nThe basement is indeed full of junk (books, dvds, boxes, old furniture) but that was mostly there when I moved in and I have never put anything down there. \n\nThe furniture in the common areas were all there when I moved in and I have even some social media posts from previous roommates and the Jenna\u2019s family from 2012 and earlier that prove this. She claims these pieces of furniture are not hers so I guess they belonged to a previous tenant? The house has basically had a revolving door of tenants in the last 15 years, so there was never a time when the house was totally empty. I guess no one had been keeping track of what furniture belongs to whom in the common areas but I don\u2019t see why that would make the burden fall on me.\n\nSo my questions are as follows:\n\nShould I get the full deposit back?\n\nShould I be held liable for removal of furniture that I never owned?\n\nCan I be held responsible or any of the junk in the pantry (old food most likely belong to my roommates. I removed all my food but can\u2019t really prove this). I find this particularly annoying because all of this stuff can just be thrown out at the curb like regular garbage so I don\u2019t see why this should even impact the deposit.\n\nCan I be held responsible for junk in the basement?

I'm not well-off by any means, but I have NEVER overdrawn my account or even incurred a maintenance fee for having less than the required balance. I saw that there had been a withdrawal for $2,000, and then a transfer of over $1,000 from my savings account to my checking account. I feared that I'd been hacked, so I immediately changed my passwords and called the bank. \n\nWhen I called the bank, they explained what happened, and I have to say that I've never heard anything like it. My father is joint on my account because I had lived abroad, and he had given me money for a visa. I wanted him to be able to access that money, so I put him on my account and just never took him off. I will say (because the bank tried blaming it on him) that my father would NEVER touch my money. He would be mortified if he thought this was at all his fault. \n\nApparently, my father cashed a check at TD for $2,000. The teller was new, and instead of removing the money from the person who wrote the check (it was a TD check), she cashed the check against MY account. After calling the bank, they assured me that this was a normal thing to do if the check wasn't a TD check (which it was), because how would they know if the check written was \"good\" or not? Until the check cleared with the other institution, it is completely normal for *any* bank to cash against the account of the person the check is written *to*, not *from.* And, as my father doesn't have his own account at TD, it came out of mine, because he is joint on the account.\n\nApparently, the teller saw that I didn't have $2,000 in my checking account (because who does?), and instead of overdrawing my account, transferred exactly enough money from my savings to cover the check. Now, my father is *not* on my savings account. He should not have access to that money. Even if cashing against my account was the right move (which, I don't see how that's legal in any situation), she should *never* have touched my savings account. \n\nObviously, I can't go into a branch right now due to COVID-19. I have called so many times, I swear they know my voice. It's been 6 days, and the money hasn't been returned to my account. I was told it would be in there within 3 business days (which is also unacceptable), and, three days later, it's still not back. I keep calling and I've already told them I'm taking my business elsewhere because it's absolutely ridiculous that this has happened, and they're being wholly unhelpful. I don't feel like they're treating this with the urgency that they should \u2014 they seem to think that, because I have *some* money left in my savings, it's \"not that bad\" and I'm \"lucky it isn't going to take 10 days.\" Both things were said to me.

I had purchased the unit at a big box store and purchased the extended five year warranty on the unit.  This came after the manufacturers one year warranty on the unit.  When it failed, I went into the local store with my receipt and asked for service options since it'd been over a year since I purchased, I expected the store to handle the service request.  They informed me that the unit in fact had a two year warranty and that I needed to talk to the manufacturer to have it serviced. Fine, no big deal.  Its a KitchenAid appliance and I went to their website and found the service section.  There, I entered all the details -- make, model, purchase date, etc, everything from the receipt where it then passed me over to a place to set up a repair date/time and whatnot.  This was fantastic, worked like a charm, great interface, etc.\n\nSo, here's where the problem begins.  The guy shows up, comes in, inspects the unit, inspects the receipt, writes a bunch of stuff down, says the unit MAY not be under warranty because he thinks there's only a 1 year warranty on it. I explain about what happened at the store, and how I do have an extended warranty, as its right on the receipt.  Says he will need time to get the parts, and will call when it arrives to set up an installation time. Fine, that's all normal and expected. Thanked him and he left.\n\nComes back... has the wrong part...has to wait another week for the right one to come.  Hey, things happen, no big deal.  We wait.\n\nAnother week passes, he gets the correct part from KitchenAid, and comes to do the installation.  Finishes up, tests the unit, it works, great.\n\nA week later we get a bill in the mail.  For $400 and an explanation that KitchenAid wouldnt cover it because its out of the warranty period.  The unit has a ONE year warranty, not TWO as I was informed in the store.\n\nI feel (and may be wrong!) that I should not have been stuck with a $400 repair bill for a unit that in fact HAS a warranty on it.    This business acted in bad faith knowing that I in fact had an extended warranty on the unit, and they STILL went ahead and performed billable work on it despite this knowledge.  I feel like KitchenAid acted negligently by sending me to an authorized repair center and set up the repair (KitchenAid contacted the repair company directly, not me) without checking on the warranty status despite taking ALL of the information from the receipt.  And I feel that this repair business acted in bad faith as well.   The big box store employees that informed me I had a two year factory warranty instead of a one year, are also to blame; and while I feel I am the one responsoble for checking my warranty periods -- both this repair business and KitchenAid made it extremely easy to feel that it was covered, and instead, get stuck with a bill.\n\nOn one hand I just feel like these guys are taking advantage of people, and on the other, I just feel like I got a bad deal and thats life, pay and move on.

This man recently hopped from one office to another across the metroplex (come to find out he was responsible for the downfall of the previous one) and it was here (2nd location) that she was finally molded for her permanent implants in July of 2019. She waited for months until she was finally scheduled for the install at the beginning of March. THE MORNING OF HER INSTALLATION she received a call that her permanents were not at that location, and were instead at a NEW location back across the damn metroplex. WTF.\n\nThen this whole pandemic outbreak begins- important detail.\n\nSuddenly, while she's waiting to receive a date to receive her implants, she gets a call from a brand new clerk at this guys brand new dental clinic. This clerk states that she owes another $2,600 (now she's stating $6,500) when she has already paid $32,000 lol. She was the recipient of a grant and paid out of pocket in the first two years. In full. Not only does she have the paper work to back that up, but the paperwork this clerk sent her doesn't even account for all the money. There's something like $5,000 missing from their documents. My partner has all the paperwork so it's a joke that these people are trying this. The clerk repeatedly (we have recordings) requested my partner come in to discuss this in person AND stated if she came in the dentist could just finish the work. My partner declined because 1. Sketchy and 2. Coronavirus. She knows for a fact (via paperwork, receipts, and previous office clerks) that she owes no money and is certainly not going to risk entering the public for the uncertainty of actually receiving the implants.\n\nGets weirder:\n\nOver the years she developed a personal relationship with this guy because he did in fact save her life with the surgery he conducted prior to developing her implants. She has always contacted him via personal cell phone and has even had appointments off the books, like when the first office would be closed for the day, just so she could get the care she needed.\n\nYesterday her temporary bridge broke, which is a huge problem if it falls out of her mouth because she will be unable to eat or even speak. So, she texts her dentist this morning letting him know it broke and asks when she will be able to receive her permanents. He beats around the bush, claims he needs to install new temporaries instead of the permanents he claims to have with him, and states that she needs to COME IN, IN PERSON to discuss this \"cordially\" with the front desk clerk what she \"owes\" stating that \"he's just a contracted dentist and not aware of finances.\" Discuss what? Why does he want her to come in rather than verify on the phone that she owes nothing? Is this a ploy to entrap her in something? This is, based on confirmed totals via bills, grants, receipts, etc. pretty clear that this is extortion.\n\nImportant points:\n\n\\-according to a previous employee of his, 7 other people are dealing with this. Unfinished services that were paid IN FULL.\n\n\\-his reviews on BBB also contain a multitude of people claiming he has done this to them as well.\n\n\\-there is zero proof that she actually owes money. no signed documents.\n\n\\-both he and his new clerk have repeatedly requested for her to come in, in person instead of discussing this via phone, email, etc.\n\n-both previous offices have confirmed that there was zero balance remaining.\n\n-the 2nd location has stated they had to stop allowing him to bring old patients in for unfinished work because it was having a financially negative effect on the company considering their services were already paid in full; therefore taking up appointment times for currently paying clients.\n\nIf you're reading this thank you so much for your time.

I was forced to stay in my room because I couldn't be around people, and her grandchild is a very loud baby.\n\nShe installed a camera in the living room area and didn't tell me which is completely against the law (which I confronted her about and she was like \"I knew you were going to say something\" well then why didn't you talk to me about it?) and then she took it out when she saw online it was illegal.\n\n She asked me to move out one month into my 3 month lease, and said she was keeping my security deposit because I drank a glass of water from a pitcher on the counter and that was in violation of some rule that she claimed was on the lease (it's not). She has acted the entire time I lived there like it was her right to my $500 security deposit. I haven't been able to work since my life-saving surgeries.\n\nShe said to take her to small claims court but my mom said my landlord can no-show, and also the courts can't force her to give me back my money. I feel like she's going to do this again AND not give me back my money because she is SHADY. I was always just money to her and she could care less that she lied to me about what I would be getting for $1000 a month (a quiet place to study) and the room in the house was like everyone lived on top of one another. My grades were suffering and I was fortunate to be able to move in with a pastor who actually cares about me and my wellbeing.\n\nI'm on food stamps and my last career is impossible to restart now with my disability (I am a tattoo artist) so I decided to go back to school so I can do a job I can earn with in spite of my disabilities. $500 is almost a month's rent for where I'm living now, and that was money I had saved for years.

The contract was for 3 months, I moved out a month early because AFTER the pandemic hit she moved her family in without telling me, knowing full well how dangerous that was to my health and also going against what we had agreed on at the beginning.

Or where to start. I am desperate. The system in place with regards to my life and the legal guardianship feels so looming and vast and imposing that it feels like there is nothing I can do to challenge it.\n\nI am a 26-year-old male (*biologically*, at least) living in Kentucky. I have some mental health diagnoses, the most notable of which is Autism Spectrum Disorder.\n\nMy mother obtained legal guardianship over me in either 2012 or 2013. I can't remember which one. We were in a courthouse. She had it legally declared.\n\nIt was a long time before I recognized my mother as the abuser she was, most notably because my father was such a violent and *worse* abuser - a sadistic monster - that it allowed my mother to fly under the radar. She is a narcissist alcoholic who deliberately exaggerates the depths and severity of my mental illness. To her friends and family and web of supporters, she is a long-suffering saint who puts up with autistic adult children (my brother and I; my brother, who is the golden child to my scapegoat, is not under legal guardianship but he has completely internalized her narrative and does not and cannot imagine a future not living with her).\n\nI am also on disability. This was arranged by mother. The guardianship is financial and complete in other ways. Pretty much every way. I am not allowed to know how much money I have, and any attempts for me to learn financial literacy or get closer to any independence is stifled or disallowed to the point where efforts to become indepedent are met with active sabotage.\n\nJust as she exaggerates my symptoms, anyone who supports me is told \"the truth.\" My mother has a legion of flying monkeys who believe her claims that I'm a non-functional, socially inept, walking disaster that will never be able to handle a job, the real world, or any life without her. It's nowhere near true, but with her sabotage, manipulation, abuse, and outright lies about me, I feel trapped and hopeless. It is clear she will never let me leave her grip; she does not want me to. The purpose of the guardianship is to keep me in the house where she can abuse me and milk me for sympathy from those in her narcissistic network.\n\nSupport workers are actively attempted by my mother to be turned against me. I had a voc rehab worker that my mother hated. I told her that my mother was a horrific abuser who is not to be trusted. Later, I found out that my mother had, despite hatred of this support worker, been chatting with her on Facebook. Here's the thing: it caused the support worker to decide that I was the problem. My mother also attempted to make a \"private session\" with MY therapist. My mother never told me she was doing this, but the therapist informed me in private. This is not unusual. Every psychiatric appointement or therapy appointment has my mother in there, with them, as joint sessions. She does all of the talking and will not allow me to have individual sessions. \"Why? Are you afraid of me saying things you won't like?\" When one therapist disallowed this, my mother signed up for her as a client. We both stopped seeing her almost immediately for reasons my mother would not explain. At this point, I was around 22 or 23.\n\nI was living day by day, but after I made a difficult but morally correct decision that cost me a lot of friends, I decided I can't live like this anymore. This is not a life. This is an imprisonment.\n\nI want the guardianship terminated. It is true that because of how influential and manipulative my mother is with the people around her, those in her web, I will lose my family. This is no concern to me.\n\nMy mother also, I believe, exploits her guardianship to take money from me. She \"charges me rent\" for an unspecified amount and will not allow me to know how much money I have.  In February and in March, she kicked me out of the house and I had to stay at a hotel for the night (I pretended with a friend's consent I was staying with him).\n\nI cannot pay a lawyer. It's just...not an option. Being on disability and with my finances exploited?\n\nI am miserable. My heart is heavy and not a day goes by I do not actively suppress a desire to die.

We all pay rent, utilities, etc. About 4 months ago, Roommate asked if his girlfriend of two years could move in.

She has no job or savings so Roommate pays the full portion for rent and for food. They both smoke marijuana excessively, but Roommate has a medical marijuana card and works at a smoke shop so we leave it alone. (We don't smoke) Girlfriend never got a key to the house so she just leaves it unlocked while we're all at work. She steals food. She left the backyard after open and let the dog out. Etc.\n\nRoommate and Girlfriend break up because he caught her sending nudes to multiple people. She said it was for money. He said there were no transactions. He makes up excuses about her moving out for a few weeks but she finally leaves.\n\nThis brings us to Sunday. We're eating with a mutual friend and find out that Girlfriend is 16. We're all horrified and angry at roommate for dating a minor and not telling us while she was in the house.\n\nWhen we get home that day, we find her in the house. Alone.

My younger brother (13) lives with my Nana since my mom couldn't handle him and my baby sister (1) is with us. I love my siblings a lot, especially my sister. \n\nI'm in a complicated situation. My mom does make me happy and she doesn't hit me often, but its when she's angry things go bad. She will constantly say that she's going to commit suicide and that she hopes I'm happy or if she goes to prison she hopes that I'm happy. But there are times where she does slap me or throw things at me. \n\nMaybe in Novemberish my mom had a fit. I don't exactly remember how it started, but it was because of me fucking up something that was little. She started yelling and screaming and because I wasn't giving her a reaction and was just standing there she started throwing stuff like huge glasses, chairs, metal containers, just basically everything on the counter... my sister was in the same room playing. My mom threw a chair and it almost hit my sister who at the time wasn't even one. I couldn't say anything because she would've hit me with something while I was picking up glass. After her yelling about how worthless, stupid, ungrateful I was she left for hours with her friend. I was left to clean up her mess and take care of my sister at the same time.\n\nShe's on medication, but she doesn't take them regularly like she's supposed and she drinks too. I feel so torn because I know I fuck up and she gets me a lot of stuff, but an argument arose yesterday.\n\nHer and her boyfriend (ex now) where arguing and my mom was being irrational. I tried calming her down, but she wasn't listening. After some time he was getting his stuff to leave and she locked the door when he was outside. He opened the door and opened it. My mom was right behind the door trying to close it on him. Her toe got a cut because of her trying to be petty and difficult. I know I messed up with the last part, but she constantly brings men into our lives and gets so mad and difficult when they leave. She's put me through so much because of it. I've almost been molested because of this. I was done, tired, and mad when she threatened to call the cops. She's already irrational and completely insane at this point. She already acts like a damn spoiled child in front of the police and gets so upset even if she's the one to call them. I have to be the adult when cops are involved.\n\nI told her, \"You know that's a bad decision, right?\" She got mad and told me something about how I didn't know what I was talking about and I snapped. I yelled, \"Why do you put us through this shit?!\" I knew I messed up. I was holding my sister and she threw her phone at me. It hit my jaw and there's a bruise now. She took my phone and spat in my face.\n\nAbout a few hours after that with my phone taken away and everything thats connected to the internet. I was giving my sister a bath. \n\nA little context for what happens next is that my mom and the rest of my family had a lot of issues. Because of that I wasn't supposed to talk to any of my family. But I lost them a week before my birthday which was in March. I miss them a lot and I never got to say goodbye. I get that I should've respected my moms wishes, but it not their fault she got arrested. She spat in my nanas face and arrived there out of no where. She was the aggressor.\n\nShe went through my phone and saw that I had texted them weeks ago. For every text she read she slapped me as hard as she could in the back of the head. I was sitting on the toilet and she only stopped when I yelled and covered my head. My mom isn't weak. She started yelling how she should've killed herself when she was 20 because it was my fault. She grabbed my hair and pulled me to the side. She said I was a betrayer, a stupid brat, and that I was useless child who did nothing, but take advantage of her and belittle her and how she'll never see me the same. She slammed the door and the shower curtain fell. She came back in and grabbed it from me. She told me the only reason she wouldn't beat me with it was because my sister was there in front of me. I refused to look at her.\n\nAnd yet I had to take care of her at around 7 because she was on the ground in the shower throwing up. I was left to take care of my sister the entire day. \n\nMy head hurts and my jaws hurts. I would've left, but I can't leave my sister. I don't feel safe, but I feel so guilty. I got my phone back last night and I talked to my boyfriend. Him and his dad are trying to figure something out to get me and my sister out of the house, but I want to be able to see my sister again. I can't bear losing my only family. \n\nWhat should I do? How do I leave? I'm not safe and I don't want to leave my sister. I'm afraid that there's not enough to make anything and I'll be stuck here.

I've never had to deal with anything like this before and I'm really frazzled.\n\nTo start, I believe she's on disability for medical reasons, as well as mentally ill. I can constantly hear her yelling at nothing and slamming things downstairs. The problem started when I started reporting her behaviors to our landlord because I would constantly wake up in the middle of the night to her slamming doors and yelling or playing with her dog at 3-4 AM. She started smoking cigarettes inside as well, which is against the lease, which I also reported to the landlord. He's asked her to stop on multiple occasions, but hasn't done much else to stop the behavior aside from that. After I started reporting her to the landlord she started yelling things at me in the stairway: she threatened that she would kill me if I left my apartment, threatened to knock my teeth out, when I went to take my garbage out she ran to her bathroom window to yell at me that she was going to slit my throat. I tried calling the cops on her about this, but they told me that unless there's physical contact they can't do anything. \n\nI went to take my garbage out last week, and she followed me outside to start harassing me. At that point I took out my phone and recorded the interaction. A half hour later the cops showed up, apparently she called them and told them that I hit her (which I didn't do). At this point I was thankful to have recorded the interaction, when they spoke to me I showed them the video and they ultimately went back downstairs and told her there was no evidence/they weren't doing anything.\n\nToday I was on a conference call with my job when I saw the cops pull up again. My windows were open, and I heard her telling them that I stole her medications off of her kitchen counter. I think she's on controlled painkillers, so that's a pretty serious accusation. I've never set a foot in that woman's apartment, and since the pandemic shut downs began i've only left my apartment to get my mail and take the garbage out. The cop spoke to me but he seemed very nonchalant about it and left without doing anything again.   \n\n\nI've told my landlord about this but he's not doing anything, not that there's anything he really can do with a moratorium on evictions.\n\nIs there anything I can do to stop this behavior?

The HOA bylaws have two rules: \u201cno parking on red curbs for more than 20 minutes\u201d and \u201cno parking on curbs in front of garage. \nMy home is the only one in about 25 or so homes that has a driveway between the garage and the curb. When I moved in, the leasing company said I could park in my own driveway. About two days after moving in, I got a violation sticker on my car when It was parked in the driveway. I furiously decided to read the parking bylaws and it mentioned nothing about parking in my driveway. My car is small and does not extend into the street at all. \n\nI printed the parking rules and left it on my dash for the last two weeks with a handwritten comment saying \u201crules do not mention violation when parked in driveway\u201d.

Our landlord came to us and told us that he wanted to raise the rent to $1,200, but Section 8 denied it because it was too high, so he wanted us to move. We went to Section 8 and they told us that he never requested a rent increase at all and that our limit was actually $1,495, and any rent increase up to that point would be fine. \n \nSo we told him that a rent increase would be fine. He then filed for an increase to $1,300 (as opposed to the $1,200 we had originally discussed), which was denied solely on the basis that the apartment was still in abatement due to needed repairs. \n \nAfter the repairs were done and the inspection was passed, we told him that Section 8 told us that he needed to file for another rent increase, and at $1,300 they would almost certainly approve it, and then we could stay. \n \nHowever, we received a message from his representative (he is currently out of the country) that he now wants to request $1,500 as the rent increase, and if we cannot pay that much, then we have to move. \n \nIn the span of a month and a half, he has gone from wanting $1,200, to $1,300, to $1,500, an over $400 increase in the rent! \n \nBut that's not all. \n \nNot only are there no units in this entire complex that are $1,500 in rent, including three bedroom apartments (this one is a two bedroom), but this apartment has never been renovated as far as we know. The unit directly above us was fully renovated under 3 years ago and they're paying $1,100, and the floor plan is completely identical to ours and everything in it is much nicer. \n \nHowever, the real problem is what we found out about the apartment immediately next door to ours. \n \nThe apartment next door is larger than our apartment, and was renovated in full at some point in the past. It is a much nicer unit than ours is. Their landlord recently raised their rent from $1,100 to $1,300.

However this *same landlord* is now trying to force us, his Section 8 tenants to move by increasing the rent to just beyond our maximum cap, which is $200 more than he is charging the people right next door to us, who have a larger, nicer apartment. \n \nDoes this qualify as discrimination? It seems like he is deliberately singling us out. We have NEVER been late on our rent, none of the repairs that needed to be done were considered by Section 8 to be our responsibility, and we have done nothing but try and resolve this situation with the landlord from the start by repeatedly agreeing to his increasingly high rent costs until he has now deliberately put us over our cap. \n \nIs he breaking any laws? What can we do about this situation? Even if he were to backpedal for some reason, we want to move, and are currently looking for somewhere to go, but I feel like he is intentionally discriminating against us.

Basically the app takes PSI and puts it in standard government forms. The issue with the forms is that they get updated a lot. At the time I worked out with the family member that I would get paid $50 dollars per case. This never panned out so I worked out that I would get paid hourly ($150/h). I know that rate sounds steep but they can afford it due the high volume of cases that my app enables them to process. In addition, other firms have full time employees that literally just do form programming.\n\nThe issue arrived recently where they stopped paying my invoices to update the forms. Their argument is that it was a \"subscription service\". Yes, I attempted to make it a subscription service, and even got two customers, but the monthly income is not enough to cover my hourly labor. I couldn't even hire a 10/h Indian laborer to make it worth it.\n\nSo yesterday, after releasing the government agency pushed out updates to 7+ of their forms, I realized that I cannot do it anymore because my carpal tunnel syndrome was really kicking off (I have a full time job in addition to this job).

She did not have her license or any other identifying information with her.\n* I do not have collision insurance because my car was old at the time of purchase, I was naive when I bought it (eight years ago), and was advised not to get collision insurance.\n* I was able to find the insurance for the other car, because I had the license plate number and took several photos.\n* They sent out an appraiser who declared my car a total loss, and offered to pay me an as-yet-undecided sum for the car to tow and scrap it.\n* However, they've been \"trying to get in contact\" with their insured party (different name than the driver gave) and if they can't get in contact with them to find out more about the driver/get their side of the story, they say they'll drop my claim.\n* I've filed a police report online and confirmed it was received.\n\nMy central questions:\n\n* Can they just drop my claim?\n* Do I have any other recourse?\n\nMore detail:\n\n* I was driving my housemate home from adopting a cat from the MSPCA. We were on the road about ten minutes when we stopped at a red light. I happened to glance up at my rearview mirror, had enough time to think \"hey, that car's going kinda fast-\" and then we were rearended at full speed.\n* We got out to look at the damage and check on the other driver (I was kind of freaking out, yelled \"what the fuck,\" and then apologized) and then I and the other driver pulled our cars forward out of the intersection to a wider shoulder of road where we could stop safely.\n* I assessed the damage and started taking photos, and my roommate called the police. However, she was directed to an automated message about reporting crashes/other incidents online, and no police were dispatched.\n* That being said, as I and the other driver (we'll say she gave her name as Betty) were exchanging info, a police car happened to drive by. They were visibly reluctant to get out due to COVID-19, and when they saw we were exchanging information, they kept driving.\n* As soon as the cops left, Betty revealed that she didn't have a license, at least not with her. \n* I gave her my name and phone number (she was older, and appeared to be having trouble entering that information in her phone, though she may have just been pretending) and told her my insurance was \\[BLANK\\] Insurance. The second I said that, she hastily said she had insurance with the same company.\n* She gave me a name that later turned out to have no listing with regards to the car/no details findable online, and two numbers (\"hers\" and \"her sister's\") which turned out to be inactive.\n* She drove off, and I called a AAA tow truck and Lyft for me, my housemate, and the new cat, as parts of my bumper were dragging on the ground from the impact.\n* The next day, I called my insurance company, who were unable to do anything for me without collision insurance, but who were able to look up the car that hit me via the license plate and photos, and found it registered to someone at \\[OTHER INSURANCE\\]. \n* I called \\[OTHER INSURANCE\\]'s local office and set up a claim with them, sending pictures and details.\n* I also, now that I had more details on the car's registration and official owner (if not the driver), submitted a police report to Boston PD online. (I've submitted one to my insurance too, and tried to submit one to the RMV, but they don't have an email address and trying to contact them is like pulling teeth)\n* \\[OTHER INSURANCE\\] sent out an appraiser who looked at the damage, the age of my car, and the mileage, and delcared it a total loss.\n* The agent at \\[OTHER INSURANCE\\] said that if my claim went through, this meant they would pay me a sum for the car, and then tow and scrap it. She sent me an incident report to fill out, which I submitted.\n* Since then, over the past two weeks, she has been trying to contact her insured via email and phone, and hasn't been able to reach her; she hasn't found any information on the driver, and we've concluded the driver gave a false name. She contacted the insured's daughter, who claims to know nothing about this.\n* My insurance gave me the address of the person who holds the policy of the other car when they told me her name; I'm obviously not going to use this information in any malicious manner, but I did some googling around with the name and address and going off that and the estimated ages listed online for the insured and her daughter, I'm guessing the driver was actually one of those two. \n* The \\[OTHER INSURANCE\\] agent told me early last week that if they can't get through to the other party, my claim will be flatly denied; ever since she told me that, in every point of contact we've had, she's made sure to \"sadly\" drop that in the conversation, as if trying to discourage me.\n* I called my insurance, and they pretty much confirmed that's standard practice.\n* Since the beginning of this week, I haven't been able to get in contact with the \\[OTHER INSURANCE\\] agent directly, just gotten maudlin \"sigh we'll probably have to deny you\" voicemails in response to my calls.\n* I've determined that today, if I don't get a call back from her, I'm going to call and ask to escalate the case.\n\nr/legaladvice, what can I do?

I filled out their form to have any and all of this information sent to me and all they have sent was the redacted interview.\n\nMy main concern is that anyone could have used that credit card since I had no clue about it and I would not have known for a long time.  I would not go looking for the credit card as I purposefully keep my credit cards with another bank. Glad I found it by accident.

So with this being my first legal advice post, I want to apologize for any errors in it. Anyway let me start off with this: This was my first ever experience buying a car. Now, with that said, let's continue on with the story.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo! Today I went to a used car dealership to pick up an RX8 that I had been eyeing. I went into this purchase knowing that this would be a money pit, but I trusted the dealership when they said the car actually **WORKED**. I give it a bit of a test drive, go down to the local Mazda dealer to see if they sneak me in for a checkup, but they were full till Monday. No problem right? The last time they had inspect this car was 2 years ago so stuff for sure should've changed. During this short 20 minute drive to and from the dealership the car, from what I can tell, runs great. It's going VRRRRT with a BRAP BRAP when I change gears after a high rev and no error codes. It's awesome! Well I go to the dealer and we talk, I discuss my worries and desire a warranty. \"No problem!\" says the dealer, \"We'll include a one month warranty just for the engine.\" I am of course pleased with this and eagerly sign the paper work. Well they take away the car to get it scrubbed and the emissions tested. Now here's the issue, they were a little too eager to drop the price down by a couple thousand, plus coupled with the fact that when they brought the car up they claimed something along the lines of, \"The emission shop was closed so just come back in a week to get it tested.\" Leads me to believe that they knew that very expensive parts of the car were busted. Even though! Even though they claimed it was fine! \n\nSo minutes later I take the car and try to go on the highway. Before I reach the highway the car dies at idle. It died 2 blocks from the dealership. Me being a bit sheepish about the fact that it died. I noticed that the battery error code and check light were on when this had happened so I decide to just put it in neutral and run it to a parking lot that was nearby (thank goodness for the RX8s 50/50 weight distribution). I then try to start the car up there . The car starts up fine in the parking lot and I go down the block to fill the tank with gas, because what I didn't notice was that the warning light for low gas was on. \"Weird.\" I thought to myself. Well I fill it up for $30 with only the most premium of gas and hook my dashcam up to the window. Now this is where something weird happens. It starts up just fine, but the battery and check engine light flash for a GOOD 5 seconds. Then they're gone. Who knows? Maybe it's just the ECU cycling through stuff. After that I go on the highway and absolutely enjoy revving this car.\n\nLet's fast forward an hour. The car dies while idle, again. This time in the middle of an intersection! Have you ever tried putting a car in park, then back in drive, then flooring it while there's about a dozen cars coming to smash into you? I did just then and it was terrifying. I didn't have time to stop and cry though. I had to get my booty to my job! During work though I being to really understand that this car is for sure a lemon. Radio didn't work, car was dying randomly, error lights were appearing, and the car won't keeps unlocking itself even when parked and turned off! Ugh you gotta put the key in the door to get it to lock. At any rate, I decided to start the car and have it run during my 3 breaks (including lunch) and it ran fine. Now I'm finally off of work. Freedom at last! The car starts up great, I pull out of the parking lot, and it hits me. The damned headlights don't work. I have to turn on the high beams to get home without driving blind. What the heck! At this time too the check engine light is on for good now.\n\nSo I have an appointment at the Mazda dealership for a full inspection at 10AM sharp and I'll be going to the used car dealership to attempt to return the car. Another problem is even though the dealer wrote down that they'll cover the engine via a \"warranty\", they had marked out the \"as is\" section of the paper work. I didn't realize this until my lunch break when I was reviewing the paperwork and I'm pretty sure I was duped there.\n\nSo. Best case I get my money back and don't need to deal with a loan. Worst case I have a 5k loan to pay off for a car I can't drive and need to pay over 7k to have the engine replaced. Ho boy. What I'd like to know from you guys though is if there is anything I can do to help persuade them into refunding me and taking the car back. I have dashcam footage of me nearly dying. As well as other footage.\n\nI live in Utah and here we have no lemon laws that cover used cars. I also don't believe we have a three day return period or anything like that. I bought the car on 4/16/2020 and will attempt to return it on 4/17/2020.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr\n\nBought lemon that didn't appear to be lemon until I had already bought it.

I live with my mom and we\u2019ve been living (renting) at our house for going on 12 years now. I\u2019ve played drums for about 6 years, inside said house. I\u2019ve never played before 10 AM or past 7 PM, and usually only for a half hour or so at a time. \n\nAbout 3 or 4 years ago some neighbors moved into the house behind my house, divided by an extra tall brick wall (their ground level is about 10 feet above mine). They started calling police on me every time I played drums, I was visited 3 times total. Each time they said I wasn\u2019t doing anything wrong. \n\nAfter the first visit, I attempted to soundproof the room, but being poor I could only afford basic foam which didn\u2019t do much. After the second time the police were called, they visited in person. I offered to work out a schedule, I gave them my phone number to text or call if it was a bad time, and they left. I stuck to the schedule exactly, never deviating but also never receiving a text, call, or visit. I assumed I was in the clear, but I was wrong. \n\nThe third time the police were called, they were extremely irate and would not cooperate with any of us, so basically the police told us to call a mediator because they were done dealing with it and wouldn\u2019t show up for a noise complaint anymore. I said to hell with it, and played when I wanted- still keeping to reasonable hours. Never before 10 and never after 7. \n\nA solid two years go by without issue and during one of those years I did not touch the kit a single time as I was living somewhere else. I come back home and start getting back into playing, still sticking to the times. No issue. \n\nI go out and pick up a used kit for free just because, and I have the bright idea of setting up a huge hybrid-Frankenstein kit in my garage, since I\u2019m getting ready to put my kit into storage as I have other stuff going on and can\u2019t play for a few weeks. I don\u2019t usually ever play in the garage cause it\u2019s a little louder than inside, but it\u2019s just once, right? I walk around, let my immediate neighbors know and nobody has a problem. I tear it up for about an hour, from 6 to 7 and start packing up. Mid-packing up, a police officer walks up my driveway and tells me he\u2019s giving me a ticket for disturbing the peace and a court date because that same neighbor is pressing charges. I am told that said neighbor has a recording of the time I spent playing, and the ticket has the neighbors name and address on it. \n\nAm I in serious trouble for this?

I went under the house because I wanted to wear a big comfy sweater that I missed (I only brought a suitcase of summer clothes to Australia because I knew it would be much warmer there). I go under the house and can't find any bags of clothing... I ask my mom where she put them and she said \"I'm not sure, whatever isn't there was donated\". WHAT?? They never said they were going to donate anything, as I asked them to keep all the boxes and bags. I asked further and she said that my roommate told them they could be donated, I immediately messaged him and he said that he heard them joking about just donating the items when I left, and he said he chimed in and said that he himself got rid of all of his stuff and joked around with them. I told her that excuse was bullshit and they could have had any ANY type of communication with me and I would told them to NOT get rid of the items... \n\nMy mom then said that some of the boxes were ripped and the bags had holes in them so she got rid of them. I continued to search and couldn't find much of anything. They got rid of my duvet, mattress, both of my memory foams pillows, drawing books with all my drawing supplies, VR headset, Samsung galaxy s8+ (including photos and memories that I did NOT upload), 500$ headphones, Google nexus, iPod, Nintendo 3ds, stereo system, they were ALL GONE along with all my clothes. \n\nThey would not have sold my items (they aren't intelligent enough to figure out prices and sell them). So they just threw out or donated them because they didn't want to deal with them. What they DID keep was reorganized into boxes and they labelled themselves. They kept DVDs, CDs, my Xbox 360, my computer and monitor and a bag with some jackets and shoes and then pots and pans. \n\nI am beyond heartbroken.

This included an eviction notice a day after I removed the dog, saying I needed to remove the dog, as well as yelling and screaming on the street by the landlord at me. This was followed up with lies about a history of bad behavior and requirements in the lease (I got a notice saying my lease makes me responsible for the fire extinguishers, and that it needed replacement. The lease definitely didn't include that). Needless to say, neither of us wanted to continue the lease after it ended in march. My girlfriend came into town for most of a day, and we spent the whole time at the house cleaning. I took two pictures, one of the living room, and one of the kitchen floor. This wasn't to demonstrate cleaning, but just to share with friends and family that I was done. That house was definitely cleaner than when I moved in.  \n\n\nI had a walk through at the end, about two weeks ago, and it went generally fine. A few things needed \"light cleaning\" and there were \"some scratches on a door that aren't listed\". Fine. Little stuff, not a big deal. Carpet needed a professional shampoo. Okay. \"Otherwise everything looks good\". I have this all on audio recording for the exact reason that I don't trust this person, and as I recall from a previous legal issue, this is a one party consent state, so I could do this surreptitiously.   \n\n\nI got my remaining security deposit back yesterday, which included a long list of things that needed cleaning, including multiple incidents remarked towards the dog, including hair and damage. Now I vacuumed probably 10 times after the dog left, and then 3 times while moving out/cleaning. I used a rubber brush to clean spots hard for the vacuum to get into. There wasn't dog hair on that carpet. They claimed there was dog hair in an upstairs bedroom, but I have always been adamant about not letting the dog into my bedroom, so it stayed downstairs, and was always in a kennel when I wasn't at home. There was also claim of \"dog damage\" in the other bedroom, but this is the same as the other room. The dog was not allowed upstairs. The list includes wiping down every wall and baseboard in the house, every cabinet, and every appliance. I personally washed the walls because I needed to clean up some of the marks left behind furniture and such, and my girlfriend cleaned out and wiped down the cabinets. I will admit I didn't wipe the walls in the downstairs bathroom, and they noted what were probably water drips from hand drying on the walls in that bathroom during walkout.  \n\n\nHow does a general sense of \"light cleaning\" needed  for a two bedroom home turn into over $800? Is there anything I can do, realistically? I don't really have great pictures from before I moved in as far as I can tell, and I certainly don't have a room by room itemization of the house after I cleaned up. Do they have to have proof that something required cleaning? Can I get quotes for a whole house cleaning and use that to make my case?

We had some mutual friends, she lived in my city, and she seemed normal and nice enough, so I accepted it and thought nothing of it and continued to live my life.\n\nNaturally, when you add someone on FB, you can follow them IG as well, so she started following my personal IG account, as well as a health/fitness account I had. She was super nice and supportive to me on both my IG accounts. She would comment on my photos and reply to my stories talking about how inspirational and amazing I was, calling me \"sweet, beautiful, and love\". It was nice enough in the beginning, but it did get to a point where she would reply to every.single.thing. I'll admit, it did feel a bit obsessive.\n\nNow let me reiterate - I have never met this girl in person in my life and still didn't really know her. Of course, I would be courteous and tell her \"Thank you!\" when she would compliment me, but never a full on conversation. \n\nOne random morning, a little over a year ago, I woke up with messages from a few of my followers on the health/fitness account. They were informing me that they had received messages from a random person on IG, that was saying that I was talking sh\\*t about them, and that I was \"drinking alcohol again and got my stomach stapled\". (I stopped drinking and lost a lot of weight over the course of 2.5 years). They sent me screenshots of the messages and lo and behold, it was the girl! \n\nI was in shock. She was always so nice to me and this completely came out of left-field. From there, it was a whirlwind of fake accounts harassing me on both of my IG accounts. Leaving comments about my appearance and just being downright ridiculous and mean. I would block one and report one, and another one would show up. I eventually made my personal page private, but at the time, I had a few partnerships on my health/fitness page, so I could not make that page private. About a week later, the harassment stopped and I never heard another peep from her for over a year....\n\n...until 2 weeks ago. I woke up to check my phone and saw that I was tagged in a post on IG. I opened up the post and there was an ENTIRE IG ACCOUNT dedicated to her disdain for me with over 60 posts. \n\nEverything from calling me a pig, saying that I'm a lesbian and that she will never date me (???), that I'm creating all these porn bot IG accounts to harass her, that she has a restraining order on me and that I'm stalking her, that I'm mentally insane, among so much other stuff that doesn't even make any sense and isn't true in the slightest. At that point, she had been posting on it for a week before I found out about it.\n\n It was a fake account, but I instantly knew it was her (typing and word style, emoji usage, similarities between her real account and the fake account, and she admitted in one of the posts that she did the same thing over a year ago). \n\nIt became clear to me that this girl is not stable and I wanted to protect my safety, so I filed a police report for harassment. The police are currently investigating, although the investigator said, \"we probably can't do much because it's on social media and hard to prove it's her\", but I have so many screenshots that link her to the profile, but I'm afraid I won't get very far with the local police with this.\n\nShe does not live in my same city anymore, but she's just a few hours away. This account is seriously causing me some major emotional distress. I have reported it over and over to IG and have had trusted friends report it as well, but because of COVID-19, IG is saying they don't have enough people on staff to review the profile. \n\nBut then, I woke up this morning to the girl now posting my work information on the fake profile. My work email, my work phone number, and saying \"for a good time to call me\" and I can't get IG to do anything about this. I have a really good job and I do not want her compromising it. She is still currently posting as I type. She has over 100 posts about me now, most including my personal information and slanderous comments. \n\nWhat can I do? Is there any way to get ahold of IG, and could they be liable for emotional distress?  I'm sure I have a case against her as well, but I do know she doesn't have very much money - might not be worth it or could it?", "title": "Girl has been cyberbullying/harassing me for over a month.

I reached my cap sometime last month.

We were traveling out of state when we received a call from our tenant that the hot water heater was not working.  We called a plumbing company to install a new hot water heater.  While the installer was there, he contacted us to say that the job was complicated (due to some electrical issues I think) and gave us a verbal quote for nearly $2,000.  He also mentioned a warranty/service agreement for $38.99 per month.  We told him to go ahead so that the tenant could have hot water - even though the $2,000K seemed very high.  We asked that we be sent specific information about the hot water heater we were purchasing and the information about the manufacture warranty and the additional service agreement option.   We never heard from him again.  \n\nThe tenant verified that she has hot water.  I called the plumbing company to again request this information as well as the invoice.  They said that they couldn't provide it and that paperwork was left with the tenant and that she should send it to us.    (My tenant did put the paperwork that was left in the mail to our home address but we didn't get it until 2 months later when we arrived home - more on that later).\nAbout a week or so later, I sent an inquiry through the plumbing companies website again asking for information and invoicing.  I received several emails from them in response - the first one saying that I hadn't had any work done with them since 2013.  Then I received another stating \"Oh, here it is - we are trying to schedule an inspection\".  I replied again with fine.  We can schedule an inspection in a couple months when we return home to Florida (there is a one-year window to have the inspection done) - and can we please have the information so that that we can finally settle this?  Their response was that they didn't have the information, and that I had to work with the Advantage Program (not sure of who that was???).  So, I'm tired of trying to get  a copy of this bill so that I can pay them - so I just decided to wait until we get home and review the paperwork that should be waiting for us.\n\nWhen we arrive home there is an envelope containing:  1) A lease agreement to rent a Rheem hot water heater for 10 years at $38.99 per month with no option to purchase it at the end of the 10 year period for a total of $4,678.80.   My husband's name is forged in 2 locations on this agreement.  (although I'm not sure if it was the company or my tenant - as I'm trying to keep her out of the drama by not asking her unless it is necessary).     2) A completely blank \"pre-authorized payment agreement\" form for me to fill out so that they can charge my bank or credit card monthly.  \n\nFlorida has a rule that these service people can put a lien on your property if payment isn't made.  This all seems so ridiculous.  I wanted to ask if it would be legal to just send them a payment for the retail cost of the hot water heater and some estimate of the labor (I just had a new hot water heater installed in my residence for $650.00 3 years ago) - but I don't even have the model of the equipment that was just installed to be able to do that. I suspect that the plumbing company has profited in some way by 'selling' this forged lease agreement to another company and that is why they refuse to send me an invoice for the actual work done.  No one from EITHER has reached out to be about payment or anything.  A friend suggested I do nothing at all until one of the companies reaches out to use - but I don't want to risk a lien going on the property.\n\nAny advice as to how to handle this without having a lien on my house or having to pay $4678.88 for a water heater?

They both were pushing a cart and for some reason the guy wasn't able to control his and it started taking speed (parking lot has a slight slope) and hit the woman. She fell hard on her ass, must have hurt. She had a hard time getting back on her feet so maybe she was injured for real and that's where the medical bills come from? Anyway. She went back to their car and half an hour later back into the store. Then she literally flew herself to the ground when she passed the section I was cleaning. That was quite an artistic \"fall\". Then of course she starting yelling and everything. So yeah, a scam alright, but maybe the injuries were real.

There were no fraudulent charges on this first card, it was simply lost and cancelled.\n\nThe following day on the 25th, I received a FedEx confirmation for the replacement card. The confirmation says it was delivered at 11:34am. I didn't notice this email, nor did I look for the package.

When I checked my online account, I noticed several charges from 1/25-1/28 totaling $2566.28. I immediately cancelled the card and filed a claim for credit card fraud.\n\nThe charges were immediately removed from my credit card statement, but days later, they were put back on. When I called, they said they my card was activated using my personal phone number and the charges were valid. I appealed the case and filed police report. I had my roommate file a police report for a package what was stolen two days later as well. I then went into my local Wells Fargo branch and faxed the two police reports to the fraud claim department.\n\nUnfortunately, the guy working at Wells Fargo filed it for the wrong credit card. He referenced the original card that was lost with my wallet and replaced, and all of my evidence went towards a case for a card I never claimed was stolen.\n\nAfter several weeks of back and forth, I finally figured it out. I was told by a representative to resend everything in one fax referencing the correct card number. I sent a new fax with a letter explaining the situation and the following items:\n\n1. **LAPD report for the stolen credit card**\n2. **Verizon Wireless bill highlighting phone activity during period in question**\n3. **LAPD report for second stolen package at same address**\n4. **Email to Lyft requesting information**\n5. **Screen shots of Lyft ride history during period in question**\n6. **Screen shots of Uber ride history during period in question**\n\n\\*Note: the card was used for several Lyft and Uber charges. I included my ride history to show that they weren't done under my account.\n\nYesterday, I received a letter from Wells Fargo stating that charges are still valid and I will have to pay them. I called them today and they said that my story has been inconsistent; that one point I claimed I received the card and now I'm claiming I never received it. That's simply not true. They just mixed up cards.\n\nAt this point, I've accrued about $60 worth of interest and I'm pretty much at my wits end with this. I feel like I've exhausted all of my options and I'm ready to throw in the towel. But $2600 is a lot of money. I feel like I've exhausted my options with this internal appeals process. Is there anything else I can do? Do I have any legal standing there? No one at Wells Fargo is helpful.

He paid them. He was taken advantage of by these pavers. They overcharged and underperformed. But, the neighbor was the only one involved and as we saw the work being done we figured this was just one of The Mayor's wild plans and even if the work was shoddy it wasn't worse than it started.
