    "# Reddit API\n",
    "While there are many public datasets for Reddit, they are often years old or not updated freqently. The goal of the project is to provide information on Covid-19 and related legal advice, so we're dealing with rapidly developing news and would like to have access to recent activity, as well as historical Reddit posts in a specified period of time. The Reddit API (via PRAW as a Python Reddit API Wrapper, making implementation easier) is powerful and can provide a lot of data and metadata, however it is limited in scope for time periods and response size. To address that, we can use the Pushshift API, an API that provides access to a vast amount of public Reddit data that has been ammassed over the years and continues to get updated by the day (? pretty frequenly I'm pretty sure). Another option rather that is accessing the back-end Elasticsearch search engine endpoint (but doesn't work right now?).\n",
    "\n",
    "Prototype 1: For the moment, Reddit data will use PRAW, which is relatively easy to retrieve. There is an Reddit Api call that can search within a subreddit, which utilizes a cloud-based search engine backend (like Apache Lucene) for internal site searches, but we'd be relying too much on Reddit's relevance algorithms. (There are other Reddit Api functions that get the top/new/hot/controversial posts in a subreddit, but they don't search queries. We could do this, but once again, the Reddit Api is limited in retrieval/time limit, so this would only be for special cases). \n",
    "Since to get historic data via Pushshift takes a while and we need to decide how to process a lot of data quickly, we won't use that for now."

I\\'ve been playing League of Legends for 6 years under the alias Squid Corona - squids are my favourite animal and Corona, believe it or not, is my real life surname. \\n\\nAs I\\'m sure everyone is well aware, there is a global pandemic called COVID-19 or, as very inconveniently for me, better known as Coronavirus. Trust me, I\\'ve heard all the jokes possible from friends and co-workers. \\n\\nAt the start of 2019 I managed to change my in-game name to just \"Corona\" as I thought the shorter version of my name was nicer, worked well with telling my real life friends to add me on League, as they all know it\\'s my surname and I think Corona is a cool name so why not have just that. I had to use one of those third party sites to check the name and stay up till midnight in order to secure my family name in League (as a side note, Riot should really consider implementing a bot-detect system to stop name sniping).\\n\\nI\\'m by most descriptions a casual player - I play one or two games a day of normal draft pick, almost always with friends just as a way of relaxing after work. On the 1st of April, I try to login to be greeted with a message telling me I need to change my name in order to proceed. I thought it was amusing at first, as almost every game a player would say in chat \"nice name\" to me, but I just shrugged my shoulders and emailed Riot in the hopes of them agreeing that it was a funny situation, and my name would be white-listed. \\n\\nAfter two weeks of back and forth with multiple \"Player Support Specialists\", I was told that they had come to the conclusion that my name would not get white-listed and that I would have to change it if I wanted to keep playing League of Legends. **This is specially stupid since in other regions, players with the name Corona are still active and playing.**\\n\\nThis to me is all very disappointing. I haven\\'t chosen the name \"Corona\" for any reason, and certainly haven\\'t done it during the covid-19 outbreak. I feel like Riot are just sticking a big middle finger to me and telling me that my family name is inappropriate to be a part of their game. I\\'m posting this to reddit because I want to know if the community really feels offended by the summoner name \"Corona\", or if I\\'m right in feeling a mild rage and sense of unfairness.\\n\\nEDIT: here\\'s proof of communication: https://imgur.com/a/OE9l8sc\\nProof of ID has also been privately sent.\\n\\nEDIT 2: Thanks for the pressure reddit, Riot has given me my account back!',\n",

I had to use one of those third party sites to check the name and stay up till midnight in order to secure my family name in League (as a side note, Riot should really consider implementing a bot-detect system to stop name sniping).&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m by most descriptions a casual player - I play one or two games a day of normal draft pick, almost always with friends just as a way of relaxing after work. On the 1st of April, I try to login to be greeted with a message telling me I need to change my name in order to proceed. I thought it was amusing at first, as almost every game a player would say in chat &amp;quot;nice name&amp;quot; to me, but I just shrugged my shoulders and emailed Riot in the hopes of them agreeing that it was a funny situation, and my name would be white-listed. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;After two weeks of back and forth with multiple &amp;quot;Player Support Specialists&amp;quot;, I was told that they had come to the conclusion that my name would not get white-listed and that I would have to change it if I wanted to keep playing League of Legends. &lt;strong&gt;This is specially stupid since in other regions, players with the name Corona are still active and playing.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;This to me is all very disappointing. I haven&amp;#39;t chosen the name &amp;quot;Corona&amp;quot; for any reason, and certainly haven&amp;#39;t done it during the covid-19 outbreak. I feel like Riot are just sticking a big middle finger to me and telling me that my family name is inappropriate to be a part of their game. I&amp;#39;m posting this to reddit because I want to know if the community really feels offended by the summoner name &amp;quot;Corona&amp;quot;, or if I&amp;#39;m right in feeling a mild rage and sense of unfairness.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: here&amp;#39;s proof of communication: &lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/OE9l8sc\"&gt;https://imgur.com/a/OE9l8sc&lt;/a&gt;\\nProof of ID has also been privately sent.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT 2: Thanks for the pressure reddit, Riot has given me my account back!&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",
