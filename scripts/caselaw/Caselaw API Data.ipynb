The plaintiff testified at a deposition that, as he exited the house, he stepped out onto the landing, and then down one stair. When he realized that he forgot to lock the interior door to the house, he stepped back onto the landing and attempted to open the outer door to the house. He alleged that the outer door extended beyond the edge of the landing, which made it difficult to stand on the <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"923\" href=\"#p923\" id=\"p923\">*923</a>landing and open the door at the same time. He further alleged that, as he tried to open the outer door, he lost his footing and began to fall. He grabbed the handrail to stop his fall, but the handrail broke.</p>\n",
      "    <p id=\"b757-4\">After the accident, the plaintiff commenced this action to recover damages for personal injuries. The defendants moved, inter alia, for summary judgment dismissing the complaint. The Supreme Court denied the motion, and the defendants appeal.</p>\n",

      "    <p id=\"b759-4\">On June 1, 2014, the plaintiff allegedly was injured when he fell off a ladder on the defendant’s property in Monroe, Orange County. On October 15, 2014, he commenced this action in the Supreme Court, Kings County, to recover damages for personal injuries, stating, as to venue, that he was a resident of Kings County. In conjunction with its answer to the complaint, the defendant served a demand to change venue to Orange County. Thereafter, the defendant timely moved pursuant to CPLR 510 (1) and (3) to change venue to Orange County, arguing that the plaintiff did not reside in Kings County, and that the convenience of material witnesses warranted the change of venue. In the order appealed from, the Supreme Court granted the defendant’s motion, finding that pursuant to CPLR 510 (3), the convenience of material witnesses warranted a change of venue to Orange County.</p>\n",
      "    <p id=\"b759-5\">CPLR 510 (3) provides that, upon motion, the court may change the venue of an action where “the convenience of material witnesses and the ends of justice will be promoted by the change.” A party moving to change venue pursuant to CPLR 510 (3) must provide information about the prospective witnesses, including, but not limited to, their names and addresses, disclose the facts about which the proposed witnesses will testify at the trial, represent that the prospective witnesses are willing to testify, and state that the witnesses would be inconvenienced if the venue is not changed <em>(see Lapidus v 1050 Tenants Corp., </em>94 AD3d 950, 950 [2012]; <em>O’Brien v Vassar Bros. Hosp., </em>207 AD2d 169, 172-173 [1995]; <em>see also Marin v Levin Props., </em>306 AD2d 256 [2003]; <em>McGarry v Columbia Greene Med. Ctr., </em>260 AD2d 451 [1999]). The defendant’s submissions satisfied none of these criteria, and accordingly, the Supreme Court should not have granted the defendant’s motion for a change of venue pursuant to CPLR 510 (3).</p>\n",
      "    <p id=\"b759-6\">CPLR 503 (a) provides, in relevant part, that “the place of trial shall be in the county in which one of the parties resided when it was commenced.” “For venue purposes, a residence is where a party stays for some time with a bona fide intent to retain the place as a residence for some length of time and with some degree of permanency” <em>(Ellis v Wirshba, </em>18 AD3d 805, 805 [2005]; <em>see Deas v Ahmed, </em>120 AD3d 750 [2014]; <em>Chehab v Roitman, </em>120 AD3d 736, 737 [2014]; <em>Forbes v Rabinovich, </em>94 AD3d 809, 810 [2012]; <em>Furth v ELRAC, Inc., </em>11 AD3d 509, 510 [2004]).

In the context of determining the proper venue of an action, a party may have more than one residence <em>(see </em>CPLR 503 [a]; <em>King v Car Rentals, Inc., </em>29 AD3d at 210).</p>\n",
      "    <p id=\"b760-3\">To prevail on a motion pursuant to CPLR 510 (1) to change venue, the defendant must show that the plaintiffs choice of venue is improper, and also that the defendant’s choice of venue is proper (see CPLR 511 [b]; <em>Deas v Ahmed, </em>120 AD3d at 750; <em>Chehab v Roitman, </em>120 AD3d at 737; <em>Gonzalez v Sun Moon Enters.

Since the factual questions could not have been properly resolved on the papers alone, the Supreme Court should have held a hearing on the issue of the plaintiff’s residency prior to its determination of the motion <em>(see Patton v Malychev, </em>132 AD3d at 830-831; <em>Tiangco v Andrickson, </em>116 AD3d 763, 764 [2014]; <em>Feather v Goglia, </em>65 AD3d 1186, 1187 [2009]).</p>\n",

      "    <p id=\"b761-9\">The defendant’s appeals from the order dated December 17, 2014, and the amended order must be dismissed because the order dated December 17, 2014, and the portion of the amended order appealed from were superseded by a money judgment of the Supreme Court, Westchester County, dated May 3, 2016 <em>(see Culen v Culen, </em>157 AD3d 930 [2018] [decided herewith]).

      "    <p id=\"b761-10\">The parties were married in August 1982. During the marriage, the defendant owned and operated Hudson Marine, Inc. (hereinafter Hudson), a diving services company, while the plaintiff was a full-time mother and homemaker. In January 2009, after 26 years of marriage, the plaintiff commenced this action for a divorce and ancillary relief. In September 2012, the parties entered into a stipulation of undisputed facts resolving issues relating to the equitable distribution of certain marital property. Pursuant to that stipulation, the parties agreed, <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"928\" href=\"#p928\" id=\"p928\">*928</a>inter alia, that the value of Hudson upon commencement of the action was $421,000, and that the value of the marital residence upon commencement of the action was $508,000. The parties also agreed to equally divide the marital portion of the defendant’s New York City District Council of Carpenters Pension Fund (hereinafter the defendant’s pension) by a qualified domestic relations order (hereinafter QDRO) pursuant to the <em>Majauskas </em>formula <em>(Majauskas v Majauskas, </em>61 NY2d 481 [1984]), and to equally divide the value of the defendant’s New York City Counsel of Carpenters Annuity (hereinafter the defendant’s annuity) accumulated from August 7, 1982, to January 22, 2009, by QDRO, plus or minus gains and losses, not including contributions made after January 22, 2009, or gains or losses on contributions made after January 22, 2009.</p>\n",
      "    <p id=\"b762-3\">A nonjury trial was held on the remaining issues of equitable distribution of the marital property and maintenance. The Supreme Court issued an amended decision after trial, and subsequently a judgment, inter alia, awarding the marital residence to the defendant, with a credit to the plaintiff in the amount of $254,000, awarding Hudson to the defendant, with a credit to the plaintiff in the amount of $105,250, and awarding the plaintiff maintenance for a total of eight years commencing on the date of the amended decision after trial, in the amount of $2,200 per month for the first five years, and $1,000 per month for the last three years. The court declined to award the defendant a separate property credit in the sum of $77,500 as to the purchase of the marital residence. The court distributed the defendant’s pension and the defendant’s annuity in accordance with the stipulation of undisputed facts. The defendant appeals from stated portions of the judgment of divorce.</p>\n",
      "    <p id=\"b762-4\">The amount and duration of maintenance is a matter committed to the sound discretion of the trial court, and every case must be determined on its unique facts (see <em>Gafycz v Gafycz, </em>148 AD3d 679 [2017]; <em>Gastello v Costello, </em>144 AD3d 723, 726 [2016]). The court may order maintenance in such amount as justice requires, considering, among other factors, the standard of living of the parties during the marriage, the distribution of marital property, the duration of the marriage, the health and present and future earning capacity of the parties, the ability of the party seeking maintenance to become self-supporting, and the reduced or lost lifetime earning capacity of the party seeking maintenance <em>(see </em>Domestic Relations Law § 236 [B] [6] [a]; <em>D’Alauro v D’Alauro, </em>150 AD3d 675 [2017]).</p>\n",
      "    <p id=\"b762-5\">Taking these factors into consideration here, the Supreme Court providently exercised its discretion in awarding the <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"929\" href=\"#p929\" id=\"p929\">*929</a>plaintiff maintenance for a period of eight years, in the sum of $2,200 per month for the first five years, and in the sum of $1,000 per month for the last three years <em>(see Osman v Osman, </em>142 AD3d 978, 979 [2016]; <em>Sawin v Sawin, </em>128 AD3d 663, 663 [2015]; <em>Naik v Naik, </em>125 AD3d 734, 735 [2015]; <em>Kay v Kay, </em>302 AD2d 711 [2003]). The court properly considered as one factor in awarding maintenance to the plaintiff the inheritance that the defendant was entitled to receive from his aunt’s estate, even though the inheritance was the defendant’s separate property and not subject to equitable distribution <em>(see </em>Domestic Relations Law § 236 [B] [6] [a] [1], as eff prior to L 2015, ch 269, § 4; <em>Owens v Owens, </em>107 AD3d 1171, 1174 [2013]; <em>Carl v Carl, </em>58 AD3d 1036, 1037 [2009]; <em>Kay v Kay, </em>302 AD2d at 712). Additionally, contrary to the defendant’s contention, because Hudson constituted a tangible income-producing asset, the court did not err in awarding the plaintiff a distributive share of Hudson in addition to maintenance <em>(see Keane v Keane, </em>8 NY3d 115, 122 [2006]; <em>Palydowycz v Palydowycz, </em>138 AD3d 810, 813 [2016]; <em>Sutaria v Sutaria, </em>123 AD3d 909, 911 [2014]; <em>Shah v Shah, </em>100 AD3d 734, 735 [2012]; <em>Weintraub v Weintraub, </em>79 AD3d 856, 857 [2010]).</p>\n",
      "    <p id=\"b763-4\">Equitable distribution law does not mandate an equal division of marital property <em>(see Scaramucci v Scaramucci, </em>140 AD3d 848, 849 [2016]; <em>Halley-Boyce v Boyce, </em>108 AD3d 503, 504 [2013]). The equitable distribution of marital assets must be based on the circumstances of the particular case and the consideration of a number of statutory factors <em>(see </em>Domestic Relations Law § 236 [B] [5] [d]; <em>Holterman v Holterman, </em>3 NY3d 1, 7 [2004]). “Those factors include: the income and property of each party at the time of marriage and at the time of commencement of the divorce action; the duration of the marriage; the age and health of the parties; the loss of inheritance and pension rights; any award of maintenance; any equitable claim to, interest in, or direct or indirect contribution made to the acquisition of marital property by the party not having title; and any other factor which the court shall expressly find to be just and proper” <em>(Taylor v Taylor, </em>140 AD3d 944, 945-946 [2016]; <em>see </em>Domestic Relations Law § 236 [B] [5] [d]; <em>Halley-Boyce v Boyce, </em>108 AD3d at 504). “A trial court is vested with broad discretion in making an equitable distribution of marital property, and unless it can be shown that the court improvidently exercised that discretion, its determination should not be disturbed” <em>(Aloi v Simoni, </em>82 AD3d 683, 685 [2011] [internal quotation marks omitted]; <em>see Saleh v Saleh, </em>40 AD3d 617, 617-618 [2007]).</p>\n",
      "    <p id=\"b763-5\">Here, considering the foregoing factors, the Supreme Court <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"930\" href=\"#p930\" id=\"p930\">*930</a>providently exercised its discretion in equitably distributing the marital assets. The plaintiff was properly awarded the sum of $105,250, representing a 25% share of the value of Hudson as of the date of commencement. Given the court’s discretion to establish the valuation date of assets <em>(see Taylor v Taylor, </em>140 AD3d at 946; <em>Pappas v Pappas, </em>140 AD3d 838, 840 [2016]), and the parties’ stipulation as to the value of Hudson on the date of commencement, the court did not err in employing the date of commencement as the valuation date for Hudson <em>(see Grabelsky v Handler, </em>127 AD3d 1141, 1142 [2015]; <em>Haymes v Haymes, </em>298 AD2d 117, 118 [2002]). Contrary to the defendant’s assertion, the court did not place undue emphasis on the inheritance that he was entitled to receive from his aunt’s estate, and was permitted to consider the inheritance as a factor in equitably distributing the marital assets <em>(see </em>Domestic Relations Law § 236 [B] [5] [d] [4], [9]; <em>Owens v Owens, </em>107 AD3d at 1174).</p>\n",
      "    <p id=\"b764-3\">Furthermore, the defendant’s contention that he was entitled to a separate property credit for his contributions to the down payment on the marital residence is without merit. The defendant’s self-serving trial testimony that his aunt gave him a check in the sum of $50,000, that his uncle gave him the sum of $10,000, and that he used these funds toward the down payment, was unsupported by documentary evidence, and insufficient to establish his entitlement to a separate property credit <em>(see Rosenberg v Rosenberg, </em>145 AD3d 1052, 1055 [2016]; <em>Horn v Horn, </em>145 AD3d 666, 667 [2016]; <em>Wasserman v Wasserman, </em>66 AD3d 880, 883 [2009]). Additionally, the Supreme Court properly found that the defendant failed to present sufficient evidence tracing the source of any funds used to purchase the martial residence to the sale of certain stock, which was purportedly the defendant’s separate property <em>(see Maddaloni v Maddaloni, </em>142 AD3d 646, 652 [2016]).</p>\n",

      "    <p id=\"b765-7\">The parties were married in August 1982. In January 2009, the plaintiff commenced this action for a divorce and ancillary relief. In October 2011, the parties executed a stipulation pendente lite, in which they agreed, inter alia, that the plaintiff would “have exclusive use and possession of the parties’ Jeep Cherokee,” and the defendant would continue to make the automobile loan payments on the vehicle. A nonjury trial on the issues of equitable distribution of the marital property and maintenance was conducted. The trial evidence established that the balance of the loan on the Jeep Cherokee (hereinafter the jeep) was approximately $10,312, and that the payments were $396.63 per month. The Supreme Court issued an amended decision after trial dated September 25, 2013, and subsequently a judgment of divorce, inter alia, awarding the plaintiff exclusive possession of the jeep, and directing that the plaintiff was solely responsible for all costs associated with the jeep, including the loan payments.</p>\n",

In an order dated December 17, 2014, the Supreme Court awarded the plaintiff an attorney’s fee in the sum of $20,000. In the event that the defendant failed to make payment to the plaintiff within 90 days of the order, the plaintiff was permitted to enter a judgment against the defendant in the sum of $20,000, “plus interest, less any credits for any sums paid toward this counsel fee award, without further notice.”</p>\n",
      "    <p id=\"b766-3\">In March 2015, the defendant moved, inter alia, in effect, to vacate the order dated December 17, 2014, asserting that he did not have to pay the plaintiff the attorney’s fee award because he had already paid the plaintiff more than he was obligated to. The defendant contended that in the order dated December 17, 2014, the Supreme Court had stated that he was entitled to a credit in the sum of $10,000, representing the payment that he made pendente lite to the plaintiff for her attorney’s fees. The defendant further contended that in the amended decision after trial, the court assigned the balance remaining on the automobile loan for the jeep in the sum of $10,312 as a debt to the plaintiff, and that he was entitled to a credit in the sum of $10,312, representing the payment that he made toward the loan balance between the conclusion of trial and when the amended decision after trial was issued. In an amended order dated August 28, 2015, the court denied that branch of the defendant’s motion.</p>\n",
      "    <p id=\"b766-4\">After the defendant failed to pay the plaintiff the attorney’s fee award, on May 3, 2016, the Clerk of the Supreme Court, Westchester County, entered a money judgment in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant in the principal sum of $20,000, plus interest.

These tactics included, but were not limited to, the defendant’s insistence that the parties proceed to a jury trial on the grounds for the divorce, despite the plaintiff having agreed either to settle on a ground other than cruel and inhuman treatment or to withdraw the case and re-file on the ground of irretrievable breakdown of the marital relationship, and the defendant’s motion filed after trial on the issues of equitable distribution and maintenance to exclude the plaintiff from a tennis club where the parties were both previously members. The defendant unnecessarily prolonged the litigation by attempting to obstruct the plaintiff from obtaining discovery regarding an inheritance that the defendant was entitled to receive from his aunt’s estate, even though it is well established that parties to a divorce action are entitled to liberal and broad discovery from one another, including with respect to separate property that is not subject to equitable distribution <em>(see Owens v Owens, </em>107 AD3d 1171, 1174 [2013]; <em>Jaffe v Jaffe, </em>91 AD3d 551, 554 [2012]; <em>Dorsa v Dorsa, </em>50 AD3d 842, 843 [2008]).</p>\n",
      "    <p id=\"b767-5\">Contrary to the defendant’s contention, in the order dated December 17, 2014, the Supreme Court did not state that the award of an attorney’s fee in the sum of $20,000 to the plaintiff should be offset by the $10,000 that the defendant paid to the plaintiff pendente lite for attorney’s fees. The court explicitly considered the amount that the defendant had paid to plaintiff prior to trial in determining that the plaintiff was entitled to a further award of an attorney’s fee in the sum of $20,000. Therefore, the defendant was not entitled to a credit in the sum of $10,000 against the award of an attorney’s fee to the plaintiff.</p>\n",
      "    <p id=\"b767-6\">Additionally, the defendant failed to demonstrate that he was entitled to an offset against the award of an attorney’s fee in the sum of $10,312, representing the amount that he paid <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"934\" href=\"#p934\" id=\"p934\">*934</a>toward the balance of the loan on the jeep after the conclusion of the trial <em>(see generally Menillo v Menillo, </em>72 AD3d 1035, 1036 [2010]). The defendant agreed in the pendente lite stipulation that the plaintiff would have exclusive use and possession of the jeep, and that he would continue to make the monthly loan payments on the jeep. Therefore, the defendant was not entitled to a credit for payments that he made pursuant to the stipulation before the court issued its amended decision after trial, particularly because the defendant does not challenge the validity of the stipulation.

      "    <p id=\"b768-9\">In November 2006, the defendant Barrington Adrian (hereinafter the defendant) executed a mortgage on his property as security for a note. After the defendant defaulted on his payment obligations, the plaintiff accelerated the debt and commenced an action on April 11, 2008, to foreclose the mortgage (hereinafter the prior foreclosure action). On April 8, 2014, the plaintiff sent the defendant a 90-day notice pursuant to RPAPL 1304, but discontinued the foreclosure action on April 23, 2014.</p>\n",
      "    <p id=\"b768-10\">On July 8, 2014, the plaintiff commenced this action to foreclose upon the same mortgage.

The plaintiff opposed the motion, arguing that it affirmatively revoked its election to accelerate the mortgage debt by discontinuing the prior foreclosure action and, alternatively, that the 90-day preforeclosure period in RPAPL 1304 tolled the statute of limitations pursuant to CPLR 204 (a). The Supreme Court granted the defendant’s motion for summary judgment dismissing the complaint insofar as asserted against him, and the plaintiff appeals.</p>\n",
      "    <p id=\"b769-4\">A mortgage foreclosure action is subject to a six-year statute of limitations <em>(see </em>CPLR 213 [4]; <em>NMNT Realty Corp. v Knoxville 2012 Trust, </em>151 AD3d 1068, 1069 [2017]). “[E]ven if a mortgage is payable in installments, once a mortgage debt is accelerated, the entire amount is due and the Statute of Limitations begins to run on the entire debt” <em>(Nationstar Mtge., LLC v Weisblum, </em>143 AD3d 866, 867 [2016] [internal quotation marks omitted]; <em>see Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. v Burke, </em>94 AD3d 980, 982 [2012]; <em>EMC Mtge.

      "    <p id=\"b769-5\">Here, the defendant established, prima facie, that the within action is untimely.

Contrary to the defendants’ contention, this argument <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"937\" href=\"#p937\" id=\"p937\">*937</a>does not present a pure question of law appearing on the face of the record which could not have been avoided if raised at the proper juncture and, therefore, is improperly raised for the first time on appeal <em>(see Bingham v New York City Tr. </em>Auth., 99 NY2d 355, 359 [2003]; <em>R &amp; B Design Concepts, Inc. v Wenger Constr.

      "    <p id=\"b771-6\">Appeal from an order of the Supreme Court, Suffolk County (Arthur G. Pitts, J.), dated June 10, 2015. The order, insofar as appealed from, granted those branches of the separate motions of the defendants Nelson &amp; Pope, LLP, DF Stone Contracting, Ltd., and Verizon New York, Inc., and the cross motion of the defendant County of Suffolk, which were for summary judgment dismissing the complaint insofar as asserted against each of them.</p>\n",
      "    <p id=\"b771-7\">Ordered that the order is modified, on the law, by deleting the provision thereof granting that branch of the motion of the defendant DF Stone Contracting, Ltd., which was for summary judgment dismissing the complaint insofar as asserted against it, and substituting therefor a provision denying that branch of the motion; as so modified, the order is affirmed insofar as appealed from, with one bill of costs payable by the defendant DF Stone Contracting, Ltd., to the plaintiff, and one bill of costs payable by the plaintiff to the defendants Nelson &amp; Pope, LLP, Verizon New York, Inc., and County of Suffolk.</p>\n",
      "    <p id=\"b771-8\">As the plaintiff was riding his motorcycle on Montauk Highway through an area where a sidewalk construction project was ongoing, he was allegedly struck in the chest by a wire that had come loose from a utility pole, causing him to fall off his motorcycle. The plaintiff commenced this action against, among others, DF Stone Contracting, Ltd. (hereinafter DF Stone), Nelson &amp; Pope, LLP (hereinafter N&amp;P), Verizon New York, Inc. (hereinafter Verizon), and the County of Suffolk.</p>\n",
      "    <p id=\"b771-9\">The Supreme Court should have denied that branch of DF Stone’s motion which was for summary judgment dismissing the complaint insofar as asserted against it. DF Stone allegedly was performing work in the location of the accident at the <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"938\" href=\"#p938\" id=\"p938\">*938</a>time of the accident and for some length of time prior to the accident, and had been unloading asphalt from a dump truck whose bed, when fully extended, reached above the height of the wire that allegedly caused the plaintiffs injuries. The evidence submitted by DF Stone failed to eliminate questions of fact as to whether it created the alleged dangerous condition <em>(see Sturm v Myrtle Catalpa, LLC, </em>149 AD3d 1130, 1132 [2017]; <em>Morris v City of New York, </em>143 AD3d 681, 682 [2016]).</p>\n",
      "    <p id=\"b772-4\">The Supreme Court properly granted that branch of N&amp;P’s motion which was for summary judgment dismissing the complaint insofar as asserted against it. N&amp;P, the engineering consultant on the subject project, made a prima facie showing that it did not have control over the work site or actual or constructive notice of the alleged dangerous condition <em>(see Rocha v GRT Constr. of N.Y., </em>145 AD3d 926, 928 [2016]; <em>Doxey v Freeport Union Free Sch. Dist., </em>115 AD3d 907, 908 [2014]). N&amp;P’s right to generally supervise the work, stop the contractor’s work if a safety violation was noted, and ensure compliance with safety regulations and contract specifications does not amount to supervision and control of the work site such that N&amp;P would be liable for any negligence of the contractor who performs the day-to-day operations <em>(see Guallpa v Canarsie Plaza, LLC, </em>144 AD3d 1088, 1092 [2016]; <em>Cabrera v Board of Educ. of City of N.Y., </em>33 AD3d 641 [2006]; <em>Warnitz v Liro Group, </em>254 AD2d 411 [1998]). In opposition, the plaintiff failed to raise a triable issue of fact.</p>\n",
      "    <p id=\"b772-5\">The Supreme Court also properly granted those branches of Verizon’s motion and the County’s cross motion which were for summary judgment dismissing the complaint insofar as asserted against each of them. Verizon, which owned the subject utility pole, and the County, which owned the roadway and sidewalk in the area of the accident, each made a prima facie showing that they did not create a hazardous or defective condition or have actual or constructive notice of its existence <em>(see Gordon v American Museum of Natural History, </em>67 NY2d 836, 837 [1986]; <em>Lococo v Mater Cristi Catholic High Sch., </em>142 AD3d 590, 590-591 [2016]; <em>Wheeler v Citizens Telecom.

      "    <p id=\"b773-6\">The Supreme Court properly denied the defendant’s motion for summary judgment dismissing the complaint and on its counterclaim to recover damages for breach of the concealment and fraud provision of the policy. The evidence submitted by <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"940\" href=\"#p940\" id=\"p940\">*940</a>the defendant revealed the existence of triable issues of fact as to whether the defendant breached the subject insurance policy by failing to pay the claim within 60 days after it received proof of loss and reached an agreement with the plaintiff as to the amount of the loss <em>(see 232 Broadway Corp. v Calvert Ins. Co., </em>149 AD2d 694, 695-696 [1989]). Further, although the defendant established its prima facie entitlement to judgment as a matter of law on the issue of whether the plaintiff breached the concealment and fraud provision of the policy and thus vitiated the defendant’s obligation to provide coverage, in opposition, the plaintiff raised a triable issue of fact as to whether she intentionally submitted an inaccurate proof of loss <em>(see Walker v Tighe, </em>142 AD3d 549, 551 [2016]; <em>Christophersen v Allstate Ins. Co., </em>34 AD3d 515, 516 [2006]; <em>St. Irene Chrisovalantou Greek Orthodox Monastery v Cigna Ins. Co., </em>226 AD2d 624 [1996]). Moreover, contrary to the defendant’s contention, it was not entitled to partial summary judgment dismissing the request for consequential damages, as it failed to make a prima facie showing that the consequential damages sought by the plaintiff were not within the contemplation of the parties when they executed the insurance policy <em>(see Pandarakalam v Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>137 AD3d 1234, 1236 [2016]; <em>30-40 E. Main St. Bayshore, Inc. v Republic Franklin Ins. Co., </em>74 AD3d 1330, 1333 [2010]).</p>\n",
      "    <p id=\"b774-4\">Since there are triable issues of fact as to whether the defendant breached the insurance policy, we decline the plaintiff’s invitation to search the record and award her summary judgment on her breach of contract cause of action <em>(see Cioffi v Target Corp., </em>114 AD3d 897, 899 [2014]; <em>Central Irrigation Supply v Putnam Country Club Assoc., LLC, </em>27 AD3d 684, 685 [2006]).</p>\n",
      "    <p id=\"b774-5\">The Supreme Court improvidently exercised its discretion in conditionally granting the plaintiff’s cross motion pursuant to CPLR 3126 to strike the defendant’s answer unless the defendant served a “meaningful” response to the plaintiff’s supplemental demand for discovery and inspection within a specified time. “The drastic remedy of striking an answer is inappropriate absent a clear showing that a defendant’s failure to comply with discovery demands is willful and contumacious” <em>(Lantigua v Goldstein, </em>149 AD3d 1057, 1059 [2017]). Here, the defendant had already complied with the plaintiff’s supplemental demand for discovery and inspection, except for items four and five of the demand. The defendant properly objected to items four and five, which called for information regarding the claims of other insureds, as those items sought information that was not nec<a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"941\" href=\"#p941\" id=\"p941\">*941</a>essary and proper to the prosecution of this action <em>(see Diaz v City of New York, </em>140 AD3d 826, 827 [2016]; <em>Cabrera v Allstate Indent.

Mazzurco allegedly defaulted on his payments due pursuant to the stipulation of forbearance, and PII SAM resumed prosecution of the foreclosure action.

The corrected order of fact-finding, insofar as appealed from, after a fact-finding hearing and upon a finding that the petitioner failed to establish that the father and the mother neglected the children Christopher D.B. and Ava B., dismissed the amended petitions relating to those children. The corrected order of fact-finding, insofar as cross-appealed from, after the fact-finding hearing, found that the father and the mother neglected the child Eric B. The order of disposition dated September 22, 2016, upon the mother’s consent, inter alia, placed the mother under the supervision of a child protective services agency for a period of six months. The order of disposition dated September 28, 2016, insofar as appealed from, after a dispositional hearing, directed the issuance of a limited order of protection against the father which failed to require him to stay away from the family home.

      "    <p id=\"b780-7\">The petitioner filed three petitions alleging, inter alia, that the father neglected the subject children by engaging in acts of domestic violence against the mother in the presence of the children. The petitions also alleged that the mother neglected the children by failing to provide them with proper supervision or guardianship in failing to take measures to have the father removed from the home. The petitions were later amended to include, among other things, an additional alleged act of domestic violence. After a fact-finding hearing, the Family Court found that the petitioner failed to establish that the father and the mother neglected the two oldest children, Christopher and Ava, and dismissed the amended petitions relating to those two children. However, the court found that both the father and the mother had neglected the youngest child, Eric. The petitioner appeals from so much of a corrected order of fact-finding dated July 26, 2016, as dismissed the amended petitions relating to Christopher and Ava. The father and the mother separately cross-appeal from so much of the corrected order of fact-finding as found that each had neglected Eric.</p>\n",
      "    <p id=\"b780-8\">At a dispositional hearing, all parties consented to Eric being released to the mother’s custody, with certain conditions. In an order of disposition dated September 22, 2016, the Family Court released Eric to the mother’s custody and placed her <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"947\" href=\"#p947\" id=\"p947\">*947</a>under the supervision of a child protective services agency for a period of six months. The mother appeals from the order of disposition dated September 22, 2016.</p>\n",
      "    <p id=\"b781-4\">As to the father, after the dispositional hearing, the Family Court denied the petitioner’s request that an order of protection be issued which would require him to stay away from the family home. In an order of disposition dated September 28, 2016, the court, inter alia, placed the father under the supervision of a child protective services agency for a period of six months and directed the issuance of a limited order of protection requiring the father to refrain from committing any criminal offense against the mother and Eric. The petitioner appeals from so much of the order of disposition dated September 28, 2016, as directed the issuance of a limited order of protection which failed to require the father to stay away from the family home, and the father cross-appeals from that order of disposition.</p>\n",
      "    <p id=\"b781-5\">Contrary to the father’s contention, the Family Court properly found that he neglected Eric by engaging in acts of domestic violence in Eric’s presence that impaired, or created an imminent danger of impairing, Eric’s physical, mental, or emotional condition <em>(see </em>Family Ct Act §§ 1012 [f] [i] [B]; 1046 [b] [i]; <em>Nicholson v Scoppetta, </em>3 NY3d 357, 371 [2004]; <em>Matter of Amelia V.M.B. [Davidson B.], </em>107 AD3d 980 [2013]; <em>Matter of Ajay Sumert D. [Vijay Anand D.], </em>87 AD3d 637, 638 [2011]; <em>Matter of Kiara C. [David C.], </em>85 AD3d 1025, 1026 [2011]; <em>Matter of Xavier </em>II., 58 AD3d 898, 899 [2009]). The evidence established that the father pushed the mother while she was holding Eric, who was approximately 10 months old at the time, causing both her and Eric to fall, thereby creating an imminent risk of impairing Eric’s physical, mental, or emotional condition. Moreover, the court providently exercised its discretion in drawing a negative inference against the father, who did not testify <em>(see Matter of Zaire D. [Benellie R.], </em>90 AD3d 923 [2011]; <em>Matter of Nicole H., </em>12 AD3d 182, 183 [2004]).</p>\n",
      "    <p id=\"b781-6\">The Family Court properly reopened the fact-finding hearing to admit Eric’s hospital record into evidence <em>(see Sweet v Rios, </em>113 AD3d 750, 752 [2014]). The hospital record was properly certified and contained the requisite delegation of authority <em>(see </em>Family Ct Act § 1046 [a] [iv]). Moreover, the statements in the hospital record as to how Eric fell were properly admitted pursuant to the business records exception to the hearsay rule, because they were relevant to the diagnosis and treatment of Eric’s injuries, and likely were relied upon by hospital personnel in developing a discharge plan to ensure his safety <em>(see </em><a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"948\" href=\"#p948\" id=\"p948\">*948</a><em>People v Ortega, </em>15 NY3d 610, 617-618 [2010]; <em>People v Atkinson, </em>150 AD3d 870, 871 [2017]; <em>People v Baught, </em>138 AD3d 1129, 1129-1130 [2016]; <em>People v Greenlee, </em>70 AD3d 966, 967 [2010]). Contrary to the father’s contention, the fact that the statements were made by the mother and not the 10-month-old child is of no consequence <em>(see Matter of Commissioner of Social Servs. of City of N.Y. v Ligia K., </em>207 AD2d 488, 488-489 [1994]; <em>United States v Yazzie, </em>59 F3d 807, 813-814 [9th Cir 1995]).</p>\n",
      "    <p id=\"b782-4\">The finding that the mother neglected Eric was supported by a preponderance of the evidence. There was a history of police being called to the family home. At the fact-finding hearing, when the mother was asked about statements she had made to the police, she either testified that she did not remember making the statements or invoked her right to remain silent. She did not even recall bringing Eric to the hospital to be treated for head trauma as a result of the fall. Under these circumstances, the record supports the Family Court’s finding that Eric’s physical, mental, or emotional condition was in imminent danger of being harmed as a result of the mother’s failure to exercise a minimum degree of care <em>(see Matter of Anthony S. [Dawn N.], </em>98 AD3d 519, 520 [2012]; <em>Matter of Shalyse WW., </em>63 AD3d 1193, 1196 [2009]; <em>Matter of Xavier II., </em>58 AD3d at 900; <em>Matter of Angelique L., </em>42 AD3d 569, 571-572 [2007]; <em>Matter of Christopher B., </em>26 AD3d 431, 432 [2006]).</p>\n",
      "    <p id=\"b782-5\">Additionally, the Family Court properly dismissed the amended petitions alleging that the father and the mother neglected Christopher and Ava. There was no evidence that these children witnessed any domestic violence incident, or that their emotional condition was impaired or placed in imminent danger of impairment <em>(see Matter of Kiana M.-M. [Robert M.], </em>123 AD3d 720, 721 [2014]; <em>Matter of Daphne G., </em>308 AD2d 132, 135 [2003]). Further, the petitioner did not allege in the petitions that the father and the mother derivatively neglected these two children <em>(see Matter of Latifah C., </em>34 AD3d 798, 800 [2006]).</p>\n",
      "    <p id=\"b782-6\">The mother is not aggrieved by so much of the order of disposition dated September 22, 2016, as placed her under the supervision of a child protective services agency for a period of six months because she consented to the disposition. Therefore, her appeal from that portion of the order of disposition dated September 22, 2016, must be dismissed <em>(see </em>CPLR 5511; <em>Matter of Beverly R., </em>38 AD3d 668, 669 [2007]). In addition, her appeal from that portion of the order of disposition dated September 22, 2016, must be dismissed as academic, as that potion of the order has expired by its own terms.</p>\n",

[Jose D.G.], </em>111 AD3d 404, 405 [2013]; <em>Matter of Chaim R.

Johnson filed a claim against the County for uninsured motorist benefits, and the County denied the claim. Subsequently, Johnson filed a demand for arbitration of her uninsured motorist claim against the County. Thereafter, the County commenced this proceeding pursuant to CPLR article 75 against Johnson and State Farm Insurance Company (hereinafter State Farm), Johnson’s private automobile insurance carrier, seeking a permanent stay of arbitration on the ground that, pursuant to Vehicle and Traffic Law § 370, the County was exempt from providing uninsured motorist benefits. State Farm cross-petitioned, inter alia, to permanently stay arbitration of an uninsured motorist claim made by Johnson against it and to direct the County to provide primary uninsured motorist benefits to Johnson. After a framed-issue hearing, the Supreme Court, inter alia, granted the petition and, in effect, denied those branches of the cross petition, finding that the County is not obligated to provide uninsured motorist benefits to Johnson.

(hereinafter the respondent), was the father of the subject child. Upon the respondent’s default, the Family Court entered orders of filiation and child support dated November 10, 2005, and March 3, 2006, respectively. Several years later, the respondent moved, inter alia, to vacate the prior order of filiation on the ground that he was never served with the underlying paternity petition. After conducting a hearing on the issue of service, the Family Court vacated the prior orders and dismissed the underlying petition for lack of personal jurisdiction. The child appeals.</p>\n",
      "    <p id=\"b786-3\"><a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"952\" href=\"#p952\" id=\"p952\">*952</a>In paternity and support proceedings, personal service of the summons and petition, inter alia, may be made by delivery of a true copy thereof to the person summoned at least eight days before the time stated therein for appearance <em>(see </em>Family Ct Act §§ 427 [a]; 525 [a]). Service of process upon a natural person must be made in strict compliance with the methods of service set forth by statute <em>(see FV-1, Inc. v Reid, </em>138 AD3d 922, 923 [2016]; <em>Washington Mut. Bank v Murphy, </em>127 AD3d 1167, 1174 [2015]; <em>Emigrant Mtge. Co., Inc. v Westervelt, </em>105 AD3d 896, 896-897 [2013]). The failure to serve process in an action leaves the court without personal jurisdiction, and renders all subsequent proceedings null and void <em>(see CitiMortgage, Inc. v Twersky, </em>153 AD3d 1230, 1231 [2017]; <em>Washington Mut. Bank v Murphy, </em>127 AD3d at 1173-1174; <em>Emigrant Mtge. Co., Inc. v Westervelt, </em>105 AD3d at 897; <em>Krisilas v Mount Sinai Hosp., </em>63 AD3d 887, 889 [2009]).</p>\n",
      "    <p id=\"b786-4\">Ordinarily, the affidavit of a process server constitutes a prima facie showing of proper service <em>(see FV-1, Inc. v Reid, </em>138 AD3d at 923; <em>Velez v Forcelli, </em>125 AD3d 643, 644 [2015]; <em>Scarano v Scarano, </em>63 AD3d 716, 716 [2009]). However, when a defendant or respondent submits a sworn denial of receipt of service containing specific facts to refute the statements in the process server’s affidavit, the prima facie showing is rebutted and the plaintiff or petitioner must establish at a hearing personal jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence <em>(see Velez v Forcelli, </em>125 AD3d at 644; <em>Machovec v Svoboda, </em>120 AD3d 772, 773 [2014]; <em>Aurora Loan Servs., LLC v Gaines, </em>104 AD3d 885, 886 [2013]). Moreover, the burden of proof does not shift during the hearing. Rather it “rests at all times” upon the plaintiff or petitioner <em>(Lexington Ins. Co. v Schuyler Bumpers, </em>125 AD2d 554, 554 [1986] [internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n",
      "    <p id=\"b786-5\">Here, the attorney for the child does not dispute that the process server’s affidavit was successfully rebutted by the respondent, and the petitioner failed to establish at the hearing that the respondent was properly served. The evidence adduced at the hearing showed that the physical description of the individual allegedly served, as described in the process server’s affidavit of service, differed considerably from the physical appearance of the respondent at the alleged time of service. In addition, the process server did not testify at the hearing, and the petitioner failed to demonstrate that the process server was unavailable to testify or that she exercised due diligence in attempting to locate the process server to testify. Accordingly, there was ample support for the Family Court’s determination that the respondent was never personally served <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"953\" href=\"#p953\" id=\"p953\">*953</a>with process. Contrary to the attorney for the child’s contention, neither the respondent’s delay in moving to vacate the prior orders, nor the fact that he may have acquired actual notice of the paternity proceeding by means other than those authorized by statute, preclude him from challenging the court’s jurisdiction over him <em>(see Matter of H. v M., </em>47 AD3d 629, 629-630 [2008]).</p>\n",

The automobile involved in the collision, which was insured under a policy issued by Allstate Insurance Company (hereinafter the Allstate policy), had the statutory minimum coverage of $25,000 per person and $50,000 per incident. The Allstate policy was tendered to Williams.</p>\n",
      "    <p id=\"b787-10\">Williams made a claim under a supplementary uninsured/ underinsured motorists (hereinafter SUM) endorsement in an automobile insurance policy issued to a relative with whom Williams allegedly lived by the petitioner, Government Employees Insurance Company (hereinafter GEICO). The policy issued by GEICO (hereinafter the GEICO policy) had SUM <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"954\" href=\"#p954\" id=\"p954\">*954</a>limits of $100,000 per person and $300,000 per incident. GEICO disclaimed coverage on the grounds that Williams was not an “insured” as that term was defined under the GEICO policy, and that the claim was subject to a policy exclusion in the SUM endorsement. Williams requested arbitration of his SUM claim. GEICO then commenced this proceeding pursuant to CPLR article 75, inter alia, to temporarily stay arbitration pending a hearing on the issue of whether Williams was an “insured” under the GEICO policy and the issue of whether the claim was subject to the policy exclusion in the SUM endorsement. In an order entered April 15, 2016, the Supreme Court granted that branch of the petition which was to temporarily stay arbitration pending a hearing on the issue of whether Williams was an “insured” under the GEICO policy and, in effect, denied that branch of the petition which was to temporarily stay arbitration pending a hearing on the issue of whether the claim was subject to the policy exclusion in the SUM endorsement.</p>\n",
      "    <p id=\"b788-3\">GEICO moved for leave to reargue that branch of the petition which was to temporarily stay arbitration pending a hearing on the issue of whether the claim was subject to the policy exclusion in the SUM endorsement. In an order entered January 17, 2017, the Supreme Court granted GEICO leave to reargue and, upon reargument, adhered to its original determination in the order entered April 15, 2016. GEICO appeals from so much of the order entered January 17, 2017, as adhered to the original determination, in effect, denying that branch of the petition which was to temporarily stay arbitration pending a hearing on the issue of whether the claim was subject to the policy exclusion in the SUM endorsement.</p>\n",
      "    <p id=\"b788-4\">At the outset, we reject Williams’s contention that the appeal should be dismissed as untimely taken. Williams did not move to dismiss the appeal on this ground, and the record does not establish that the time within which to take an appeal from the January 17, 2017 order expired before GEICO filed its notice of appeal <em>(see </em>CPLR 5513).</p>\n",

      "    <p id=\"b789-3\">Here, the SUM endorsement in the GEICO policy provided, in relevant part, that SUM coverage did not apply “to bodily injury to an insured incurred while occupying a motor vehicle owned by that insured, if such motor vehicle is not insured for SUM coverage by the policy under which a claim is made, or is not a newly acquired or replacement motor vehicle covered under this terms of this policy.” This policy exclusion excludes from SUM coverage compensation for bodily injuries sustained by an insured when injured in a motor vehicle accident while occupying a motor vehicle he or she owns, which vehicle was not covered under the policy.</p>\n",
      "    <p id=\"b789-4\">The issue of whether this policy exclusion excludes coverage in this case must be determined by the Supreme Court, and not the arbitrator <em>(see e.g. Matter of Government Empls.

GEICO met its initial burden of demonstrating that a factual issue exists as to the applicability of this exclusion. GEICO submitted the SUM benefits claim form, signed by Williams and the policyholder, which disclosed that Williams was operating his motorcycle at the time of the accident and that the motorcycle purportedly had coverage under a different GEICO policy at the time of the accident. Therefore, a hearing should have been held to determine if the exclusion applied <em>(see Matter of Government Empls. Ins. Co. v Avelar, </em>108 AD3d at 673; <em>Matter of New York Cent. Mut.

      "    <p id=\"b790-3\">In July 2016, the Administration for Children’s Services (hereinafter ACS) filed a petition alleging that the mother abused her then three-month-old child, Kylee J., who suffered an arm fracture and a skull fracture. Kylee was removed to the custody of ACS and placed in kinship foster care with a maternal aunt. On March 8, 2017, the mother gave birth to Aaliyah J. In a petition dated March 10, 2017, ACS alleged that the mother derivatively abused Aaliyah based on the earlier injuries to Kylee. At a hearing pursuant to Family Court Act § 1027, the mother consented to the removal of Aaliyah to ACS custody, to be placed in kinship foster care with another maternal aunt (hereinafter the second maternal aunt). The mother applied for supervised overnight visitation with Aaliyah in order to breastfeed her at night and bond with her. The parties stipulated, inter alia, that the mother had undergone a mental health evaluation, that the mother had signed a HIPAA release form so that ACS could consult with her health care providers, that the mother had begun parenting classes, and that the maternal aunt who supervised the mother’s visitation with the older child, Kylee, had stated that the mother’s interactions with Kylee were at all times appropriate. Furthermore, the second maternal aunt agreed that she would install a lock on the door to the bedroom where she and Aaliyah would sleep, and that upon Aaliyah’s waking at night, the aunt would supervise the mother’s contact with Aaliyah.</p>\n",
      "    <p id=\"b790-4\">In an order dated March 16, 2017, the Family Court removed Aaliyah from the mother’s custody on consent, released her to the second maternal aunt with ACS supervision, and granted the mother’s application for supervised overnight visits. The court allocuted both the mother and the second maternal aunt as to the consequences of failing to abide by or enforce the order. ACS appeals from so much of the order as granted the mother’s application for supervised overnight visitation.</p>\n",
      "    <p id=\"b790-5\">During the pendency of an abuse proceeding, a respondent whose child is in the temporary custody of a social services official pursuant to article 10, part 2 of the Family Court Act shall “have the right to reasonable and regularly scheduled visitation” with the child (Family Ct Act § 1030 [a]) and shall “be granted reasonable and regularly scheduled visitation unless the court finds that the child’s life or health would be endangered thereby” (Family Ct Act § 1030 [c]; <em>see Matter of Nyla W.

The order, insofar as appealed from, upon an order of that court dated March 2, 2016, granting that branch of the petitioner’s motion which was for summary judgment on the issue of whether the father severely abused the subject child, and after a dispositional hearing, found that the father severely abused the subject child, terminated his parental rights, and transferred guardianship and custody of the subject child to <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"958\" href=\"#p958\" id=\"p958\">*958</a>the petitioner and the Commissioner of Social Services of the City of New York for the purpose of adoption.</p>\n",
      "    <p id=\"b792-3\">Ordered that the order of fact-finding and disposition is affirmed insofar as appealed from, without costs or disbursements.</p>\n",
      "    <p id=\"b792-4\">In 2012, the Administration for Children’s Services (hereinafter ACS) filed petitions pursuant to Family Court Act article 10 alleging, inter alia, that the father severely abused the child Jaiden P. (hereinafter Jaiden), for whom he was legally responsible, and derivatively severely abused his biological child Riley C.P. (hereinafter Riley), Jaiden’s brother. During the fact-finding hearing on the petitions, the father was convicted in the Supreme Court, Kings County, upon his plea of guilty, inter alia, of attempted course of sexual conduct against a child in the first degree in violation of Penal Law § 130.75 (1) (a), with respect to acts he committed against Jaiden. Following the father’s conviction, the fact-finding hearing was suspended and ACS moved, among other things, for summary judgment against the father on the issue of whether he severely abused Jaiden and derivatively severely abused Riley within the meaning of Social Services Law § 384-b (8) (a) (ii). In an order of fact-finding dated January 28, 2015, the Family Court found, by clear an convincing evidence, that the father severely abused Jaiden and derivatively severely abused Riley. Thereafter, ACS moved pursuant to Family Court Act § 1039-b for a finding, among other things, that reasonable efforts to reunite the father with Riley were no longer required. The Family Court granted that motion, which the father did not oppose.</p>\n",
      "    <p id=\"b792-5\">On the father’s prior appeal, this Court affirmed the finding that he derivatively severely abused Riley within the meaning of Social Services Law § 384-b (8) (a) (ii) <em>(see Matter of Keishaun P. [Tyrone P.], </em>140 AD3d 1171 [2016]). The father did not challenge the finding that he severely abused Jaiden.</p>\n",
      "    <p id=\"b792-6\">In July 2015, while the prior appeal was pending, the petitioner commenced this proceeding pursuant to Social Services Law § 384-b, inter alia, to terminate the father’s parental rights to Riley. The petitioner moved, among other things, for summary judgment against the father. In an order dated March 2, 2016, the Family Court, among other things, granted that branch of the petitioner’s motion which was for summary judgment on the issue of whether the father severely abused Riley. After a dispositional hearing, the court issued an order of fact-finding and disposition dated June 1, 2016, among other things, finding that the father severely abused Riley, terminating his <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"959\" href=\"#p959\" id=\"p959\">*959</a>parental rights, and transferring guardianship and custody of Riley to the petitioner and the Commissioner of Social Services of the City of New York for the purpose of adoption. The father appeals from the order of fact-finding and disposition.</p>\n",
      "    <p id=\"b793-4\">The father contends that the Family Court’s finding by clear and convincing evidence in the Family Court Act article 10 proceeding that he derivatively severely abused Riley is not sufficient, for the purposes of the instant proceeding to terminate his parental rights, to establish that he severely abused Reily. He bases this contention on the fact that Jaiden, the child against whom the felony sex offense was committed, was not his biological child, but rather a child for whom he was legally responsible. He argues, therefore, that a fact-finding hearing was required in order to determine whether he severely abused Riley. The father’s contention is without merit. A finding by clear and convincing evidence in a Family Court Act article 10 proceeding that a parent severely abused a child within the meaning of Social Services Law § 384-b (8) (a) (ii) establishes that the child was severely abused in a proceeding to terminate the parent’s parental rights under Social Services Law § 384-b <em>(see </em>Social Services Law § 384-b [8] [d]). Under Social Services Law § 384-b (8) (a) (ii), a child is severely abused when the child has been found to be an abused child within the meaning of Family Court Act § 1012 (e) (iii) as a result of a parent’s actions, provided that the parent committed or knowingly allowed to be committed a felony sex offense. Since the finding that the child was abused may itself be derivative, Social Services Law § 384-b (8) (a) (ii) contemplates derivative findings <em>(see Matter of Marino S., </em>100 NY2d 361, 375 [2003]). The Court of Appeals held in <em>Matter of Marino S. </em>that a derivative finding of severe abuse may be made under Social Services Law § 384-b (8) (a) (ii) where the subject child’s parent committed the sex offense against the subject child’s sibling <em>(see Matter of Marino S., </em>100 NY2d at 375). The father’s contention that the sibling against whom the sex offense was committed must also be the biological child of the respondent parent is without merit <em>(see id.).</em></p>\n",
      "    <p id=\"b793-5\">In addition, based on the evidence adduced at the disposi-tional hearing, the Family Court properly determined that Riley’s best interests would be served by terminating the father’s parental rights and freeing him for adoption by his foster mother, with whom he had been living since 2012, had bonded, and had expressed his desire to remain <em>(see Matter of Davina R.M.R.L. [Jennifer A.], </em>123 AD3d 1126, 1128 [2014]; <em>Matter of Tiwana M., </em>267 AD2d 144, 145 [1999]).</p>\n",

As is relevant to this appeal, on February 25, 2015, a default judgment was entered against Kingsway. Thereafter, on March 9, 2016, Kingsway filed a motion pursuant to CPLR 5015 (a) (1) and (4) to vacate the default judgment and for leave to file a late answer. The plaintiff failed to timely serve any opposition to the motion but faxed an affirmation, without exhibits, to Kingsway in the late afternoon preceding the return date. Counsel for the plaintiff then appeared on the return date with an affirmation in opposition and nine exhibits attached thereto. The Supreme Court held that the plaintiff’s failure to timely serve his opposition papers constituted a default in opposing Kingsway’s motion to vacate. In an order dated May 13, 2016 (hereinafter the May 2016 order), the court granted, upon the plaintiff’s default, Kingsway’s motion to vacate the default judgment against it and directed Kingsway to serve its answer by May 20, 2016.</p>\n",
      "    <p id=\"b794-7\">By notice of motion dated June 21, 2016, the plaintiff moved, pursuant to CPLR 5015 (a) to vacate the May 2016 order. In an order entered August 17, 2016, the Supreme Court denied the plaintiff’s motion. The plaintiff appeals from that order.</p>\n",
      "    <p id=\"b794-8\">To vacate his default in opposing Kingsway’s motion to vacate the default judgment against it, the plaintiff was required to demonstrate a reasonable excuse for his default and a potentially meritorious opposition to the motion <em>(see </em>CPLR 5015 [a] [1]; <em>Taylor Appraisals v Prokop, </em>99 AD3d 985, 985 [2012]; <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"961\" href=\"#p961\" id=\"p961\">*961</a><em>Walker v Mohammed, </em>90 AD3d 1034 [2011]; <em>Roche v City of New York, </em>88 AD3d 978, 979 [2011]; <em>Casali v Cyran, </em>84 AD3d 711 [2011]). “While law office failure can be accepted as a reasonable excuse in the exercise of a court’s sound discretion, the movant must submit supporting facts to explain and justify the default, and mere neglect is not accepted as a reasonable excuse” <em>(Ogunmoyin v 1515 Broadway Fee Owner, LLC, </em>85 AD3d 991, 992 [2011]; <em>see Taylor Appraisals v Prokop, </em>99 AD3d at 985; <em>Morrison v Rosenberg, </em>278 AD2d 392, 392 [2000]).</p>\n",
      "    <p id=\"b795-4\">Here, the plaintiff’s proffered excuse of law office failure was vague and unsubstantiated. Thus, it did not constitute a reasonable excuse for his default <em>(see Taylor Appraisals v Prokop, </em>99 AD3d at 985; <em>Ogunmoyin v 1515 Broadway Fee Owner, LLC, </em>85 AD3d at 992; <em>Alberton Devs., Inc. v All Trade Enters., Inc., 74 </em>AD3d 1000, 1000-1001 [2010]). Accordingly, the Supreme Court providently exercised its discretion in declining to consider the plaintiff’s opposition to Kingsway’s motion to vacate the default, despite no showing of prejudice to Kingsway, as the plaintiff failed to provide a valid excuse for the late service of its opposition papers (see <em>Risucci v Zeal Mgt. Corp., </em>258 AD2d 512 [1999]; <em>Bush v Hayward, </em>156 AD2d 899 [1989]). In any event, the plaintiff also failed to demonstrate a potentially meritorious opposition to Kingsway’s motion to vacate (see <em>Airtight Sec.

      "    <p id=\"b796-4\">The defendant pleaded guilty to two counts of burglary in the second degree under two separate indictments in exchange for the Supreme Court’s promise that, if the defendant successfully completed a substance abuse treatment program, the indictments would be dismissed. The court explained that, if the defendant violated the terms of the plea agreement, he would be sentenced to two concurrent determinate terms of imprisonment of 10 years, to be followed by 5 years of post-release supervision. After he was discharged from his fourth substance abuse treatment facility for having obtained a controlled substance on a prescription not through an affiliate of the substance abuse treatment center, the court conducted an inquiry as to whether there were legitimate bases for the defendant’s discharges from the drug treatment programs, and whether the information supplied to the court was reliable and accurate <em>(see People v Fiammegta, </em>14 NY3d 90, 98 [2010]; <em>People v Rivera, </em>32 AD3d 446, 446 [2006]). Upon finding, among other things, that the bases for the discharges were legitimate, the court declined the defendant’s request for a further opportunity for drug treatment, and sentenced the defendant to two concurrent determinate terms of imprisonment of seven years, to be followed by five years of postrelease supervision.</p>\n",
      "    <p id=\"b796-5\">Contrary to the defendant’s contention, the record demonstrates that his waiver of the right to appeal was knowing, intelligent, and voluntary <em>(see People v Bryant, </em>28 NY3d 1094 [2016]; <em>People v Sanders, </em>25 NY3d 337 [2015]; <em>People v Lopez, </em>6 NY3d 248 [2006]). The defendant’s valid waiver of his right to appeal forecloses his claims that the Supreme Court improvidently exercised its discretion in imposing an enhanced sentence, as well as his claim that the enhanced sentence was excessive <em>(see People v Gary, </em>106 AD3d 932, 932-933 [2013]; <em>People v Emma, </em>101 AD3d 1146, 1147 [2012]).</p>\n",

The People argue, among other things, that review of the defendant’s sentence is foreclosed by his appeal waiver.</p>\n",
      "    <p id=\"b799-7\">“A waiver of the right to appeal is effective only so long as the record demonstrates that it was made knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily” <em>(People v Lopez, </em>6 NY3d 248, 256 [2006]; <em>see People v Bradshaw, </em>18 NY3d 257, 264 [2011]; <em>People v Brown, </em>122 AD3d 133, 136 [2014]). Here, the record of the plea proceeding did not demonstrate that the defendant knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently waived his right to appeal. The Supreme Court, after inquiring of counsel whether the defendant had executed a written waiver, advised the defendant: “[Y]ou have just executed the waiver of appeal. And by doing so, you have given up your right to appeal, which means there will be no appeal with regards to anything in your case.” Instead of ascertaining whether the defendant had made a knowing, voluntary, and intelligent choice to waive his right to appeal as a condition of his plea, the court merely informed the defendant that he had already waived his right to appeal by executing the appeal waiver and then confirmed that the defendant understood this established fact. “[A] defendant does not validly waive his or her right to appeal where the colloquy suggests that ‘waiving the right to appeal [is] mandatory rather than a right which the defendant [is] being asked to voluntarily relinquish’ ” <em>(People v Brown, </em>122 AD3d at 137, quoting <em>People v Pelaez, </em>100 AD3d 803, 803 [2012]). Moreover, the court failed to establish on the record that the defendant read and understood the written waiver, or discussed the waiver with his counsel <em>(see People v Elmer, </em>19 NY3d 501, 510 [2012]; <em>People v Callahan, </em>80 NY2d 273, 283 [1992]; <em>People v Brown, </em>122 AD3d at 139). Under these circumstances, the purported waiver of the defendant’s right to appeal is not enforceable <em>(see People v Simon, </em>153 AD3d 1435 [2017]; <em>People v Colon, </em>153 AD3d 550 [2017]; <em>People v Head, </em>147 AD3d 1083 [2017]; <em>People </em><a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"966\" href=\"#p966\" id=\"p966\">*966</a><em>v Bynum, </em>142 AD3d 1183 [2016]; <em>People v Burnett-Hicks, </em>133 AD3d 773 [2015]).</p>\n",

In any event, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution <em>(see People v Contes, </em>60 NY2d 620 [1983]), we find that it was legally sufficient to establish the defendant’s guilt of that crime beyond a reasonable doubt <em>(see People v Van Praag, </em>153 AD3d 559, 560 [2017]). Moreover, in fulfilling our responsibility to conduct an independent review of the weight of the evidence <em>(see </em>CPL 470.15 [5]; <em>People v Danielson, </em>9 NY3d 342 [2007]), we accord great deference to the jury’s opportunity to view the witnesses, hear the testimony, and observe demeanor <em>(see People v Mateo, </em>2 NY3d 383, 410 [2004]; <em>People v Bleakley, </em>69 NY2d 490, 495 [1987]). Upon reviewing the record here, we are satisfied that the verdict of guilt as to burglary in the second degree was not against the weight of the evidence <em>(see People v Romero, </em>7 NY3d 633 [2006]).</p>\n",
      "    <p id=\"b802-4\">Contrary to the defendant’s contention, the Supreme Court providently exercised its discretion in denying his request for an adjournment, which request was made on the ground that he was suffering from a back ailment for which he was taking medication <em>(see People v Woolson, </em>122 AD3d 1353, 1354 [2014]; <em>see generally People v O’Daniel, </em>105 AD3d 1144, 1146 [2013], <em>affd </em>24 NY3d 134 [2014]). “ ‘The determination whether to grant an adjournment is committed to the sound discretion of the . . . court,’ and ‘absent a showing of prejudice, the court’s denial of a request for an adjournment will not be disturbed’ ” <em>(People v Struss, </em>79 AD3d 773, 774 [2010], quoting <em>People v McRae, </em>62 AD3d 723, 724 [2009]; <em>see People v Spears, </em>64 NY2d 698, 699-700 [1984]). Here, the defendant did not indicate that his back ailment or the medication he was taking made him unable to understand or follow the proceedings. Moreover, the court’s observation of the defendant and knowledge of his efforts to delay the case on prior occasions gave the court ample reason to deny the request <em>(see generally People v Woolson, </em>122 AD3d at 1354; <em>People v Doyle, </em>82 AD3d 564, 564 [2011]). To the extent the defendant contends that the court’s decision deprived him of his right to be present at all material stages of trial because he fell asleep during a pretrial proceeding shortly after his request for an adjournment was denied <em>(see generally People v Struss, </em>79 AD3d at 774), that contention is without merit. The pretrial proceeding concerned issues of law and, as such, did not implicate his peculiar factual knowledge or otherwise present the potential for his meaningful participa<a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"969\" href=\"#p969\" id=\"p969\">*969</a>tion <em>(see People v Fabricio, </em>3 NY3d 402, 406 [2004]; <em>People v Singson, </em>40 AD3d 1015, 1017 [2007]). Accordingly, the defendant’s due process right to be present was not implicated <em>(see People v Fabricio, </em>3 NY3d at 406; <em>People v Rodriguez, </em>85 NY2d 586, 591 [1995]).</p>\n",
      "    <p id=\"b803-4\">Nevertheless, a new trial is required because the defendant was deprived of his right to the effective assistance of counsel. “ ‘[W]hen reviewing claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, care must be taken to avoid confusing true ineffectiveness with mere losing tactics. The performance of counsel must be viewed without the benefit of hindsight and if counsel provided meaningful representation in the context of the evidence, the law, and the circumstances of the particular case, the constitutional requirement will have been met’ ” <em>(People v Olsen, </em>148 AD3d 829, 830 [2017], quoting <em>People v Butler, </em>143 AD2d 140, 140-141 [1988]; <em>see People v Baldi, </em>54 NY2d 137, 147 [1981]). Moreover, in order to prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel based on counsel’s choices, a defendant must establish that they cannot be objectively explained as part of a legitimate strategy (see <em>People v Evans, </em>16 NY3d 571, 575 [2011]). Further, since a defendant is entitled to meaningful, not perfect, representation (see <em>People v Oathout, </em>21 NY3d 127, 128 [2013]), the fact that counsel may have made errors does not by itself establish that counsel was ineffective (see <em>People v Casey, </em>149 AD3d 771, 772 [2017]).</p>\n",
      "    <p id=\"b803-5\">The defendant was discovered by the complainant in a storage room or closet in the basement of the complainant’s home. When the complainant encountered the defendant, the defendant did not have any property in his hands. However, a laptop case that had been in the storage area had been moved outside of that area, but was still in the basement. Upon being discovered, the defendant waved his arms in a circular motion and, without blinking, repeated, over and over, “hallelujah,” and then fled. The complainant chased the defendant and used his cellphone to summon the police. The complainant lost sight of the defendant for only brief intervals before returning to his home to meet the police. Within a few minutes, the complainant and the police saw the defendant emerging from the nearby property where the complainant had last seen him. The defendant was charged with burglary in the second degree (Penal Law § 140.25 [2]) and criminal mischief in the fourth degree (Penal Law § 145.00 [1]). At trial, defense counsel pursued a defense of mistaken identification. After the close of the evidence, counsel made no request that the court submit any lesser included offense, and no lesser included offense was <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"970\" href=\"#p970\" id=\"p970\">*970</a>submitted. The defendant was convicted of burglary in the second degree and criminal mischief in the fourth degree.</p>\n",
      "    <p id=\"b804-3\">On appeal, the defendant contends that counsel was ineffective for failing to request that the court submit criminal trespass in the second degree as a lesser included offense of burglary in the second degree. The People contend that mistaken identification was the strongest possible defense, and that counsel’s failure to request the lesser included offense could be objectively explained as having been a legitimate tactical decision in furtherance of that “all-or-nothing” defense. The People also contend that submission of the lesser included offense could have distracted the jury from the mistaken-identification defense.</p>\n",
      "    <p id=\"b804-4\">The People’s argument overlooks several important considerations. Although there was sufficient evidence to establish that the defendant intended to commit a crime in the basement, a reasonable view of the evidence, taking into account, among other things, the less than compelling evidence that the defendant had stolen something from the residence and the defendant’s bizarre behavior upon being discovered, supported a finding that the defendant intended to commit criminal trespass in the second degree but did not also intend to commit a crime inside the residence (see <em>People v Devonish, </em>6 NY3d 727, 728 [2005]). Accordingly, upon request, the Supreme Court would have been required to submit criminal trespass in the second degree as a lesser included offense of burglary in the second degree <em>(see People v Ingram, </em>140 AD3d 1777, 1778 [2016]; <em>People v Borges, </em>90 AD3d 1067, 1069 [2011]; <em>cf. People v Zhagnay, </em>142 AD3d 1029, 1030 [2016]; <em>People v Freeman, </em>98 AD3d 682, 683-684 [2012]).</p>\n",
      "    <p id=\"b804-5\">In deciding whether to ask for submission of the lesser included offense, defense counsel was obligated to consider the possible consequences of that decision for his client. The defendant was a persistent violent felony offender who, upon his conviction of burglary in the second degree <em>(see </em>Penal Law § 70.02 [1] [b]), faced a minimum sentence of 16 years to life imprisonment <em>(see </em>Penal Law § 70.08 [3] [b]). By contrast, upon conviction of criminal trespass in the second degree, which, like the remaining charge, criminal mischief in the fourth degree, was a class A misdemeanor, the defendant faced a maximum of one year in jail. That is not to say that counsel would have been required to argue the lesser included offense in summation, but it was not reasonable for counsel to deprive the jury of the opportunity to consider it <em>(cf. People v Nesbitt, </em>20 NY3d 1080, 1081-1082 [2013]). Given the weakness of the <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"971\" href=\"#p971\" id=\"p971\">*971</a>mistaken-identification defense, the plausibility of the lesser included offense, and the enormous sentencing disparity between a burglary conviction and a criminal trespass conviction, counsel’s failure to request submission of the lesser included offense cannot be considered part of a legitimate all-or-nothing strategy. Under the circumstances, counsel’s failure to request submission of the lesser included offense deprived the defendant of his right to meaningful representation <em>(see People v Turner, </em>5 NY3d 476 [2005]).</p>\n",

      "    <p id=\"b806-7\">However, upon the exercise of our independent factual review power (see CPL 470.15 [5]), we find that the verdict of guilt was against the weight of the evidence. “[W]eight of the evidence review requires a court first to determine whether an acquittal would not have been unreasonable. If so, the court must weigh conflicting testimony, review any rational inferences that may be drawn from the evidence and evaluate the strength of such conclusions. Based on the weight of the credible evidence, the court then decides whether the jury was justified in finding the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt” <em>(People v Danielson, </em>9 NY3d 342, 348 [2007]; <em>see People v Bleakley, </em>69 NY2d 490 [1987]). “Essentially, the court sits as a thirteenth juror and decides which facts were proven at trial” <em>(People v Danielson, </em>9 NY3d at 348-349).</p>\n",
      "    <p id=\"b806-8\">Here, an acquittal would not have been unreasonable. The only witness who identified the defendant prior to trial admitted to being intoxicated at the time of the stabbing incident. That witness failed to identify the defendant at trial. Although the People presented the testimony of three other witnesses who identified the defendant at the trial, those witnesses did not identify the defendant at any point prior to the trial, even though they were present at the scene of the crime when the defendant was apprehended and they appeared at a police precinct for questioning later that day. Two of the witnesses’ descriptions of the perpetrator’s clothing varied significantly from the clothing worn by the defendant upon his apprehension, which occurred within minutes of the incident. At the scene, those witnesses provided no further description of the <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"973\" href=\"#p973\" id=\"p973\">*973</a>defendant. Despite testimony that the victim began “gush[ing]” blood after he was stabbed during a physical struggle, the arresting officer did not remember having seen any blood on the defendant’s person or clothing when he was apprehended.

The complainants testified that the defendant, while aided by others with a metal pipe and a bat, continuously pummeled them, and that while this attack took place, one of the defendant’s fellow attackers ripped their jewelry from their bodies in plain sight. Accordingly, contrary to the defendant’s contention, the conclusion that the defendant intentionally aided his fellow attackers in forcibly stealing the complainants’ property can be readily inferred from the defendant’s conduct and the surrounding circumstances <em>(see Matter of Juan J., </em>81 NY2d 739, 740-741 [1992]; <em>People v Luke, </em>279 AD2d 534, 535 [2001]). Moreover, upon our independent review pursuant to CPL 470.15 (5), we are satisfied that the verdict of guilt was not against the weight of the evidence <em>(see People v Romero, </em>7 NY3d 633, 644-645 <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"974\" href=\"#p974\" id=\"p974\">*974</a>[2006]). To the extent that the defendant challenges the Supreme Court’s jury charge with regard to robbery, the challenge is without merit, as the court’s instruction on robbery, read as a whole, was proper <em>(see People v Fields, </em>87 NY2d 821, 823 [1995]).</p>\n",
      "    <p id=\"b808-4\">The defendant’s contention that two of the counts of robbery in the first degree should have been dismissed as multiplicitous is unpreserved for appellate review <em>(see </em>CPL 470.05 [2]; <em>People v Cruz, </em>96 NY2d 857, 858 [2001]; <em>People v Campbell, </em>120 AD3d 827 [2014]) and, in any event, without merit <em>(see People v Jackson, </em>264 AD2d 857 [1999]; <em>People v Negron, </em>229 AD2d 340, 340-341 [1996]).</p>\n",
      "    <p id=\"b808-5\">The defendant contends that certain remarks made by the prosecutor during summation deprived him of a fair trial and constituted reversible error, because she allegedly mischarac-terized the evidence, vouched for the credibility of the People’s witnesses, and made inflammatory comments. The defendant’s contentions are unpreserved for appellate review, since he either made only one-word objections, failed to request curative instructions, or failed to timely move for a mistrial on this ground (see CPL 470.05 [2]; <em>People v Balls, </em>69 NY2d 641, 642 [1986]; <em>People v Salnave, </em>41 AD3d 872, 874 [2007]). In any event, most of the comments alleged to be improper were either fair comment on the evidence (see <em>People v Ashwal, </em>39 NY2d 105 [1976]), or responsive to arguments and theories presented in the defense summation (see <em>People v Galloway, </em>54 NY2d 396 [1981]; <em>People v Moore, </em>29 AD3d 825, 825-826 [2006]). To the extent that any of the prosecutor’s remarks were improper, they did not deprive the defendant of a fair trial, and any other error in this regard was harmless, as there was overwhelming evidence of the defendant’s guilt and no significant probability that the error contributed to the defendant’s conviction <em>(see People v Crimmins, </em>36 NY2d 230, 241-242 [1975]; <em>People v Hill, </em>286 AD2d 777, 778 [2001]).</p>\n",

      "    <p id=\"b809-8\">In an action, inter alia, to recover damages for chiropractic malpractice, etc., the plaintiffs appeal, as limited by their brief, from so much of an order of the Supreme Court, Queens County (O’Donoghue, J.), dated December 10, 2014, as granted the separate motions of the defendants Robert J. Kleinwaks, TLC Medical Services, P.C., Robert K. Health Care Management, Inc., doing business as Roslyn Health and Wellness Center, and Hadassah Orenstein, and the motion purportedly made on behalf of the deceased defendant Thomas V. Venice, pursuant to CPLR 1021 to dismiss the complaint in its entirety for failure to timely substitute a representative for the deceased defendant Thomas V. Venice, and denied those branches of the plaintiffs’ cross motion which were to appoint a representative for the deceased defendant Thomas V. Venice and, upon appointment, substitute the representative for Thomas V. Venice as a defendant.</p>\n",

Venice is dismissed, and that portion of the order is vacated; and it is further,</p>\n",
      "    <p id=\"b810-4\">Ordered that the order is modified, on the law, by deleting the provision thereof granting the separate motions of the defendants Robert J. Kleinwaks, TLC Medical Services, P.C., Robert K. Health Care Management, Inc., doing business as Roslyn Health and Wellness Center, and Hadassah Orenstein pursuant to CPLR 1021 to dismiss the complaint in its entirety for failure to timely substitute a representative for the deceased defendant Thomas V. Venice, and substituting therefor a provision granting those separate motions only to the extent of dismissing the complaint insofar as asserted against the deceased defendant Thomas V. Venice, and otherwise denying those separate motions; as so modified, the order is affirmed insofar as reviewed, without costs or disbursements.</p>\n",
      "    <p id=\"b810-5\">On March 11, 1999, the plaintiffs commenced this action, inter alia, to recover damages for chiropractic malpractice based on chiropractic services rendered in 1998. On February 14, 2001, the plaintiffs filed a note of issue and certificate of readiness. On June 5, 2002, the action was marked “stayed” by the Supreme Court. On January 21, 2005, the former counsel of the defendant Thomas V. Venice (hereinafter the decedent), who had been retained by the decedent’s insurance carrier, notified the Supreme Court and the parties that the decedent had died on March 8, 2004. Despite some belated effort by the plaintiffs’ counsel, no representative of the decedent’s estate has been appointed. In the order appealed from, the Supreme Court, among other things, granted the separate motions of the defendants pursuant to CPLR 1021 to dismiss the complaint in its entirety based upon the plaintiffs’ failure to timely substitute a representative for the decedent, and denied those branches of the plaintiffs’ cross motion which were to appoint a representative of the decedent’s estate and, upon appointment, substitute the representative for the decedent as a defendant. We modify.</p>\n",
      "    <p id=\"b810-6\">“The death of a party divests the court of jurisdiction and stays the proceedings until a proper substitution has been made pursuant to CPLR 1015 (a). Moreover, any determination rendered without such substitution will generally be deemed a nullity” <em>(Vapnersh v Tabak, </em>131 AD3d 472, 473 [2015] [internal quotation marks and citations omitted]). The death of a party terminates his or her attorney’s authority to act on behalf of the deceased party <em>(see id. </em>at 474; <em>Lewis v Kessler, </em>12 AD3d <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"977\" href=\"#p977\" id=\"p977\">*977</a>421, 422 [2004]). Although the determination of a motion pursuant to CPLR 1021 made by the successors or representatives of a party or by any party is an exception to a court’s lack of jurisdiction, here, one of the motions pursuant to CPLR 1021 was made by the former attorney for the decedent purportedly on behalf of the decedent. Since the former attorney lacked the authority to act, the Supreme Court lacked jurisdiction to consider that motion to dismiss <em>(see Vapnersh v Tabak, </em>131 AD3d at 474; <em>Lewis v Kessler, </em>12 AD3d at 422). Accordingly, so much of the order as granted the motion purportedly made on behalf of the decedent is a nullity.</p>\n",
      "    <p id=\"b811-3\">Nonetheless, the Supreme Court had jurisdiction to consider the other defendants’ separate motions to dismiss pursuant to CPLR 1021 and to consider the plaintiffs’ cross motion. CPLR 1021 provides, in pertinent part, that “[i]f the event requiring substitution occurs before final judgment and substitution is not made within a reasonable time, the action may be dismissed <em>as to the party for whom substitution should have been made, </em>however, such dismissal shall not be on the merits unless the court shall so indicate” (emphasis added; <em>see Terpis v Regal Hgts. Rehabilitation &amp; Health Care Ctr., Inc., </em>108 AD3d 618, 619 [2013]; <em>Borruso v New York Methodist Hosp., </em>84 AD3d 1293, 1294 [2011]). CPLR 1021 also provides, in pertinent part, that “if the event requiring substitution is the death of a party, and timely substitution has not been made, the court, before proceeding further, shall, on such notice as it may in its discretion direct, order the persons interested in the decedent’s estate to show cause why the action or appeal should not be dismissed.” The latter provision is intended to provide special protection for the estate of a deceased plaintiff where the opponent seeks dismissal of the action based on the estate’s failure to make timely substitution <em>(see </em>Vincent C. Alexander, Practice Commentaries, McKinney’s Cons Laws of NY, CPLR C1021:2).</p>\n",
      "    <p id=\"b811-4\">Here, the Supreme Court providently exercised its discretion in determining that substitution of the decedent was not made within a reasonable time. As such, the court providently exercised its discretion in denying those branches of the plaintiffs’ cross motion which were to appoint a representative for the decedent and, upon appointment, substitute the representative for the decedent as a defendant. Given that substitution was not made within a reasonable time, dismissal of the complaint as against the decedent, “the party for whom substitution should have been made” (CPLR 1021), was proper. However, contrary to the court’s determination, CPLR 1021 did <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"978\" href=\"#p978\" id=\"p978\">*978</a>not authorize dismissal of the complaint as against any of the other defendants.</p>\n",

The Clerk is directed to enter judgment in favor of defendants dismissing the complaint.</p>\n",
      "    <p id=\"b462-7\">This personal injury action arises out of the death of Edward Bradley (decedent), an experienced elevator maintenance mechanic, who was electrocuted as a result of coming into contact with a transformer while servicing a malfunction in one of the building’s elevators. Decedent was working alone when he died; there is no evidence of how the accident occurred.</p>\n",
      "    <p id=\"b462-8\">Defendant HWA 1290 III LLC (HWA) owns the building. Nonparty Schindler Elevator Corporation (Schindler), the building’s elevator maintenance contractor, employed decedent as the building’s resident or “stationary” elevator maintenance mechanic. Codefendant United Elevator Consultants Service, Inc. (United) is the elevator consultant retained by HWA to manage the building’s elevator modernization project and its machine rooms and to monitor Schindler’s performance under its elevator maintenance contract with HWA.</p>\n",
      "    <p id=\"b462-9\">The accident occurred in the elevator motor room on the ninth floor where the elevator control cabinets and hoist motors are located. Decedent’s body was discovered hours after his death in the motor room. He was found lying partially inside the bottom of the #3 elevator control cabinet with his body slumped over the metal plate covering the transformers. The medical examiner determined that he was the victim of an apparent accidental electrocution. Photographs of the control cabinet and the decedent, taken after his body was lifted out of the cabinet, depicted rags on top of the transformers. Additionally, screws and wire nuts were found on the floor beneath the transformers, which are located at the bottom of the control cabinet.</p>\n",
      "    <p id=\"b462-10\">FDNY Captain Jeffrey Facinelli responded to the 9-1-1 call. At the scene, Facinelli observed decedent “face down on the floor” with one of his arms “reaching into the cabinet” and his <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"629\" href=\"#p629\" id=\"p629\">*629</a>“right arm and right side of his chest were lying on top of a transformer inside of the control panel.”</p>\n",
      "    <p id=\"b463-4\">Chief Elevator Inspector Douglas Smith from the New York City Department of Buildings (DOB) conducted a postaccident investigation. He testified that decedent was electrocuted when his right arm came into contact with the middle of the three transformers. With regard to how the accident might have happened, Smith’s report surmised that “ [i] t appears [decedent] was working at the bottom of the controller where the transformer was mounted and may have been reaching over and below the transformer when his arm and body made contact.” Smith testified that “maybe [decedent] dropped something, was reaching for something,” that there were many “possibilities,” but that all were “speculation.” Smith’s report further provided that “[decedent] appears to have been performing maintenance on the #3 elevator controller in the 9th floor motor room” based on the fact that the #3 elevator’s “fault log revealed a brake fault occurred at 1:30pm on 3/28/12, which appears to be the reason for the [decedent] trouble shooting the elevator’s controller.”</p>\n",
      "    <p id=\"b463-5\">Plaintiffs commenced this wrongful death action alleging common law negligence and violations of the Labor Law. With regard to the common-law negligence and Labor Law § 200 claims, plaintiffs alleged that defendants were liable based on the claim that the lighting in the motor room was not adequate, and that the transformer on which decedent was electrocuted did not have a cover.</p>\n",
      "    <p id=\"b463-6\">Defendants moved for summary judgment dismissing the complaint. The motion court, as is relevant on this appeal, denied in part defendants’ motion and allowed plaintiffs to pursue their common-law negligence and Labor Law § 200 claims insofar as such claims were based on the alleged inadequate lighting in the motor room and the alleged lack of a cover over the transformers because “[defendants fail[ed] to demonstrate that the uncovered transformers and the lighting did not create dangerous conditions readily observable to defendants.” We reverse.</p>\n",
      "    <p id=\"b463-7\">Labor Law § 200 “codifies landowners’ and general contractors’ common-law duty to maintain a safe workplace” <em>(Ross v Curtis-Palmer Hydro-Elec. Co., </em>81 NY2d 494, 505 [1993]). “Claims for personal injury under the statute and the common law fall into two broad categories: those arising from an alleged defect or dangerous condition existing on the premises and those arising from the manner in which the work was performed” <em>(Cappabianca v Skanska USA Bldg. </em>Inc., 99 AD3d <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"630\" href=\"#p630\" id=\"p630\">*630</a>139, 143-144 [1st Dept 2012])- “Where . . . the accident arises . . . from a dangerous premises condition, a property owner is liable under Labor Law § 200 when the owner created the dangerous condition ... or when the owner failed to remedy a dangerous or defective condition of which he or she had actual or constructive notice” <em>(Mendoza v Highpoint Assoc., IX, LLC, </em>83 AD3d 1, 9 [1st Dept 2011] [internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n",
      "    <p id=\"b464-3\">With regard to the claimed inadequate lighting in the motor room, the dissent takes the position that a factual issue exists because “decedent was using a flashlight at the time of death” given that a flashlight was found near his body. Further, plaintiffs and the dissent rely on the testimony of Juan Melendez, a Schindler employee who, at one point in time prior to the accident, worked as decedent’s helper. He testified that the fluorescent lighting in the ninth floor motor room “wasn’t that good at all.” In addition, Dennis Olson, plaintiffs’ certified elevator inspector expert, states that “[p]oor lighting conditions would have created a safety hazard for [decedent] by impairing his ability to see his work area—including the uncovered transformers.” We respectfully disagree with this position for the following reason.</p>\n",
      "    <p id=\"b464-4\">Melendez’s testimony is merely conclusory and fails to raise a factual issue as to whether the lighting in the motor room was up to code <em>(see Cahill v Triborough Bridge &amp; Tunnel </em>Auth., 31 AD3d 347 [1st Dept 2006] [plaintiff failed to provide sufficient evidence to create an inference that the amount of lighting fell below the specific statutory standard by relying on conclusory and nonspecific assertions of witnesses stating that the area was “dark” or “a little dark”]; <em>see also Carty v Port Auth. of N.Y. &amp; N.J., </em>32 AD3d 732, 733 [1st Dept 2006], <em>lv denied </em>8 NY3d 814 [2007] [“plaintiff’s vague testimony that the lighting was 'poor’ and the basement where he fell was ‘dark’ was ‘insufficient to create an inference that the amount of lighting fell below the specific statutory standard’ ”]), particularly in view of the fact that Olson, other than merely stating the obvious, namely, that “poor” lighting “would” have created a safety hazard, critically, failed to opine that the lighting in the motor room was not code compliant. This failure is fatal to plaintiffs’ claim given the testimony of Smith, who conducted the postaccident investigation, that the lighting in the motor room was up to code, and the absence from the record of any evidentiary proof of violations for inadequate lighting. Accordingly, defendants’ motion for summary judgment dismissing the claims based on inadequate lighting should be granted.</p>\n",
      "    <p id=\"b465-2\"><a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"631\" href=\"#p631\" id=\"p631\">*631</a>Plaintiffs’ Labor Law § 200 and common-law negligence claims are based on the alleged dangerous condition of a lack of a cover over the transformers on which the decedent was electrocuted. Indeed, Melendez testified that there was a threat that a person could touch one of the transformers and be electrocuted because none of the transformers had covers. Thus, the issue to be resolved is whether defendants demonstrated that they did not cause or create, or have actual or constructive notice of, the allegedly dangerous condition, so as to warrant summary judgment in their favor. For the reasons that follow, resolution of this issue is not dependent on how the accident occurred, and, as such, a proximate cause analysis is not warranted. Further, with regard to the alleged dangerous condition, the absence of any witnesses is of no moment <em>(see German v Morales, </em>24 AD3d 246, 247 [1st Dept 2005] [plaintiff decedent’s expert raised an issue of fact as to whether defendant deviated from industry standards]; <em>Detres v New York City Hous. Auth., </em>271 AD2d 309, 310 [1st Dept 2000] [plaintiff decedent proffered evidentiary and other materials to support the assertion that a dangerous condition existed]).</p>\n",
      "    <p id=\"b465-3\">With regard to the issue of whether defendants caused or created a hazardous condition, there is no dispute that HWA and United did not design or manufacture the elevator control cabinet, or any of its electrical components, including the transformers, which was installed some time in 1997. HWA purchased the elevator system from nonparty O’Thompson Company, who designed and manufactured it during or prior to 1997. Plaintiffs proffer no challenge.</p>\n",
      "    <p id=\"b465-4\">As to whether defendants had notice of the alleged dangerous condition, Richard B. Wallace, the building’s property manager, testified that he was never informed that there was any problem with the elevator control cabinet or that the transformers lacked a proper cover either by the DOB or by United despite the fact that both DOB and United conducted inspections of the ninth floor motor room. Philip A. Garcia, United’s president, testified that a cover was not required on the transformers because the transformers were in an enclosed cabinet. Further, Smith testified that if a transformer is in a cabinet, such as these transformers, the cabinet itself operates as the cover for the transformer, and that such a transformer does not have a separate cover over them. Additionally, Jon B. Halpern, defendants’ licensed professional engineer expert, inspected the accident site, and provided the following opinion: “Any suggestion that the building owners HWA 1290 and its elevator consultant United Elevator Consultants—neither of <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"632\" href=\"#p632\" id=\"p632\">*632</a>which had any experience in elevator component design— should have recognized the absence of a barrier over the transformers in the 1997 manufactured O’Thompson control cabinet as a hazard to the Schindler mechanic is unsupportable. . . . It is the recognized custom in the elevator industry for the building owners and their elevator consultants to look to the New York City Department of Buildings CNYCDOB’) for concluding the safety of the design of elevator equipment in service in NYC. When this elevator was modernized in 1997 with the O’Thompson controller the NYCDOB approved the installation and found no problems with its design.”</p>\n",
      "    <p id=\"b466-3\">Indeed, Halpern noted that “ [i] ollowing [the] accident, . . . the inspector who investigated [the] accident for the City did not issue a violation for the design of this controller—which would have carried a ‘hazardous/cease use’ directive—but rather opined in deposition that this control cabinet was safe because it had a closeable cabinet to protect non-professionals from the electrical hazards inside.”</p>\n",
      "    <p id=\"b466-4\">Finally, Halpern stated that “[t]he 1997 O’Thompson controller met all the applicable codes and standards,” that it “was safe,” and that further barriers separating the transformers from the other components were “not required under any applicable standards back in 1997 when the subject control cabinet was designed and manufactured.”</p>\n",
      "    <p id=\"b466-5\">Plaintiffs have failed to raise an issue of fact concerning actual or constructive notice. They have not proffered any evidence that any complaints were made to defendants by the decedent, Melendez, or anyone else that the lack of covers over the transformers was dangerous, or that defendants should have known that the absence of such a cover was dangerous and was in violation of a statute, ordinance or regulation. Nonetheless, plaintiffs and the dissent rely on Olson for the proposition that the lack of a cover over the transformer violated American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and is evidence that defendants had notice of the dangerous condition. For the following reasons, such reliance, respectfully, is misplaced.</p>\n",
      "    <p id=\"b466-6\">Olson relies on ANSI A 17.5, § 5.2, which states as follows: “Barriers shall be installed to prevent contact with live parts if inadvertent contact with bare live parts during normal service and adjustment operation is considered probable. Note: Troubleshooting or the replacement of fuses is not considered a normal service adjustment operation with respect to control equipment, but the resetting of overload devices, repeated adjustment of timers or switches, etc., are considered normal service operations.”</p>\n",
      "    <p id=\"b467-2\"><a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"633\" href=\"#p633\" id=\"p633\">*633</a>Olson’s reliance on ANSI is not proper. To begin, the Environmental Testing Labs, an independent tester/certifier of products in the elevator industry, certified the elevator control cabinet as complying with the ANSI requirements. Even if the elevator control cabinet did not comply with the above ANSI standard because the transformers did not have a cover, plaintiffs have failed to establish that defendants were required by law to comply with the above ANSI standard. Indeed, the above ANSI standard has not been adopted by or incorporated into New York City’s elevator code and ANSI itself is not a statute, ordinance or regulation. Thus, a violation thereof is not evidence of negligence <em>(see Gonzalez v City of New York, </em>109 AD3d 510, 512 [2d Dept 2013] [ANSI standards do not constitute statutes, ordinances, or regulations and not proper evidentiarily in determining proper standard of care]).</p>\n",
      "    <p id=\"b467-3\">The dissent also relies on Olson’s statement that United “inspected the #3 control cabinet on numerous occasions in the 2 years prior to March 28, 2012 and thus knew, or should have known, that the transformers lacked this safety cover at that time” and his opinion that “with a reasonable degree of technical certainty, . . . that if the transformer had a safety cover then [decedent] would not have been electrocuted.”</p>\n",
      "    <p id=\"b467-4\">Olson’s statements are speculative and conclusory, and fail to raise an issue of fact as to defendants’ actual or constructive notice of the alleged dangerous condition. Further, Olsen’s opinion that had there been a cover on the transformer decedent would not have been electrocuted is pure speculation. Again, plaintiffs fail to point to any past complaints about the transformers, any time when the transformers or the cabinet did not pass inspection, or any industry-wide problems or issues with this type of cabinet and transformers that would provide actual or constructive notice of a dangerous condition.</p>\n",
      "    <p id=\"b467-5\">Accordingly, the motion court should have granted defendants’ motion to dismiss the claims related to the lack of a cover over the transformers.</p>\n",

      "    <p id=\"b467-7\">The HWA 1290 defendants owned the building located at 1290 Avenue of the Americas. Decedent was an employee of <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"634\" href=\"#p634\" id=\"p634\">*634</a>nonparty Schindler Elevator Corp., the building’s maintenance contractor. He was the building’s resident mechanic for over five years preceding the fatal incident.</p>\n",
      "    <p id=\"b468-4\">Defendant United Elevator Consultants Service, Inc. was hired by the HWA defendants as an elevator consultant to monitor Schindler’s performance under its contracts with the building. The contract between the HWA defendants and United required United to provide one dedicated mechanic and one helper onsite during normal working hours.</p>\n",
      "    <p id=\"b468-5\">On the afternoon of March 28, 2012, decedent was working in an electrical control cabinet located in the motor room on the ninth floor of the building.<a class=\"footnotemark\" href=\"#footnote_2_1\" id=\"ref_footnote_2_1\">1</a> Later that day, decedent was found dead from electrocution atop transformers that were located on the bottom right side of the cabinet. The medical examiner’s report listed cause of death as “electrocution,” and the manner of death as an “accident (right arm contacted electrical transformer).” He was not wearing safety gloves. Photos of the accident scene showed a handheld meter and handheld light next to decedent’s body.</p>\n",
      "    <p id=\"b468-6\">Douglas Smith, the chief inspector for the NYC Department of Buildings who conducted the post-accident investigation, concluded that decedent’s accident occurred at 3:30 p.m., and that he was alone at the time of death.</p>\n",
      "    <p id=\"b468-7\">The inspector testified that it appeared decedent had been reaching into the cabinet and that his right biceps made electrical contact with the transformer located on the lower right corner of the panel. The inspector agreed that a cover on the contact point would have prevented decedent from being electrocuted. He also agreed that a helper might be beneficial for tasks requiring an extra set of hands, including those where a helper might hold a drop light to better illuminate equipment. He also agreed that if a helper were present, he could have shut down the mainline switch in the motor room (located approximately 12-15 feet away), stopping the current and preventing decedent from being electrocuted.</p>\n",
      "    <p id=\"b468-8\">Juan Melendez was decedent’s helper for five years. He characterized the lighting in the ninth floor machine room as “poor.” He testified that sometimes they had to use a “little flashlight” to peer inside the cabinet. The transformers inside the cabinet did not have covers.</p>\n",
      "    <p id=\"b468-9\">Melendez was reassigned to an elevator modernization proj<a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"635\" href=\"#p635\" id=\"p635\">*635</a>ect shortly before decedent’s accident. No one replaced him as decedent’s helper; if decedent required the assistance of a helper, one of the workers on the project would assist. Since the modernization team worked from 7:00 to 3:30 p.m., decedent was alone during the 3:30 to 5 p.m. time frame.</p>\n",
      "    <p id=\"b469-4\">Plaintiffs commenced this wrongful death action on or about January 17, 2014. Defendants moved for summary judgment dismissing the complaint, asserting that plaintiff was not engaged in “construction work” so as to impose liability under Labor Law § 241 (6), and that the negligence claim could not be sustained because the cause of the accident was unknown. Defendants relied on the expert affidavit of John Halpern, a licensed professional engineer. Halpern opined that the 1997 O’Thompson electrical cabinet complied with manufacturing standards. He acknowledged that new cabinets installed as part of the modernization project had plexiglass barriers separating the transformers from the other components, but noted that “the components inside the new cabinet [we] re substantially closer to the transformers than in the 1997 O’Thompson cabinet.” Halpern maintained that because decedent was engaged in “troubleshooting” at the time of his death, section 5.2 of the Safety Code for Elevators did not apply.<a class=\"footnotemark\" href=\"#footnote_2_2\" id=\"ref_footnote_2_2\">2</a></p>\n",
      "    <p id=\"b469-5\">Plaintiffs opposed, asserting that defendants had failed to provide a helper for decedent though contractually obligated to do so, failed to provide adequate lighting, and created a hazardous condition by failing to provide a cover on the transformer which electrocuted the decedent. Plaintiffs relied on the affidavit of Dennis Olson, a certified elevator inspector. Mr. Olson opined that the photographs of the control cabinet where decedent was working at the time of death depicted exposed transformers with no safety covers. He opined that since United had inspected the control cabinet on numerous occasions in the two years prior to the accident, they knew, or should have known, that the transformers lacked a safety cover. He opined, in light of the findings of the medical examiner, and within a reasonable degree of technical certainty, that decedent would not have been electrocuted had the transformer had a safety cover. He noted that the Safety Code <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"636\" href=\"#p636\" id=\"p636\">*636</a>for Elevators (ASME/ANSIA 17.5, § 5.2) required that “[Carriers shall be installed to prevent contact with live parts if inadvertent contact with bare live parts during normal service and adjustment operation is considered probable.” Mr. Olson further opined that while it was not possible to ascertain the exact task decedent was engaged in at the time of death, the absence of the helper placed him in danger if he were forced to perform a task alone that was generally reserved for two workers.</p>\n",
      "    <p id=\"b470-3\">The motion court granted defendants’ motion to the extent of dismissing the section 241 (6) claim, and decedent’s Labor Law § 200 and common-law negligence claims to the extent predicated on the contractual duty to provide a helper, and otherwise denied the motion. I would affirm.</p>\n",
      "    <p id=\"b470-4\">While “sheer speculation” as to the cause of an accident is not permissible <em>(see Teplitskaya v 3096 Owners Corp., </em>289 AD2d 477 [2d Dept 2001]), proximate cause may nonetheless be demonstrated in the absence of direct evidence of causation and may be inferred from the facts and circumstances underlying the injury. To establish a prima facie case of negligence based on circumstantial evidence, “it is enough that plaintiff shows facts and conditions from which the negligence of the defendant and the causation of the accident by that negligence may be reasonably inferred” <em>(Schneider v Kings Hwy. Hosp. Ctr., </em>67 NY2d 743, 744 [1986] [brackets omitted]). Plaintiffs need not eliminate every other possible cause of the accident but defendant’s negligence, as defendants suggest; rather, plaintiffs’ proof must render those other causes sufficiently remote as to enable the jury to arrive at a verdict based not on speculation, but on logical inferences to be drawn from the evidence <em>(id. </em>[plaintiff established a prima facie case via proof that the side rails on the decedent’s bed had been lowered, in violation of a hospital rule requiring that they be maintained in a raised position, from which it might be deduced that a staff person had lowered the bed rails, a more likely possibility than that the frail and elderly decedent had lowered the rails herself, particularly given the effort to activate a spring latch at the foot of the bed]; <em>Maresca v Lake Motors, </em>25 NY2d 716 [1969] [for jury to determine whether the defendant’s car, traveling in a parallel lane to the decedent, collided with the decedent’s truck because the defendant crossed into the lane or because the decedent’s truck veered into the defendant’s car]; <em>Davila v Sleepy’s, LLC, </em>142 AD3d 851 [1st Dept 2016] [circumstantial evidence in support of the plaintiffs’ claim furnished a basis for jury to infer the defendants’ liability for a bedbug infestation]; <em>Hernandez v Alstom Transp., Inc., </em>130 AD3d 681, 683 [2d Dept 2015] <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"637\" href=\"#p637\" id=\"p637\">*637</a>[plaintiffs raised triable issues of fact as to whether the circumstantial proof rendered it more likely that an employee of defendant software company that maintained train’s communication systems had placed a shoe paddle in the train door to prop it open than an employee of NYCTA]).</p>\n",
      "    <p id=\"b471-4\">Plaintiffs have established a prima facie case via proof that the cause of decedent’s death was electrocution; that the manner of death was an “accident (right arm contacted electrical transformer)”; that decedent was discovered next to the uncovered transformers with burn marks on the right side of the body, indicating that he was reaching into the cabinet at the time of death; that the lighting was inadequate; and that decedent lacked a required helper to perform his work. This evidence rendered it more likely than not that decedent was electrocuted due to defendants’ failures to shield decedent from the transformers, rather than the remote possibility that decedent was electrocuted because he passed out or lost his balance or even that he failed to wear safety gloves.<a class=\"footnotemark\" href=\"#footnote_2_3\" id=\"ref_footnote_2_3\">3</a> This latter surmise is undercut by the fact that decedent was not found to have contact marks on his hands. Further, no evidence was offered that such “safety gloves” would have prevented decedent from being electrocuted.</p>\n",
      "    <p id=\"b471-5\">On this record, plaintiffs raise issues of fact as to whether decedent died owing to the negligence of defendants. There is an issue of fact as to whether the lack of safety cover over the transformers constitutes negligence. Plaintiffs maintain that a cover was required as per ANSI § 5.2. However, the parties dispute whether decedent was engaged in “troubleshooting” at the time of death, such that the ANSI § 5.2 did not apply; and whether the ANSI standard required a “cover” other than the cabinet itself.</p>\n",
      "    <p id=\"b471-6\">There is also an issue of fact regarding the adequacy of the lighting in the machine room. While the City inspector testified that the lighting in the machine room was up to code, he could not recall the minimum requirements for lighting under the code, and had no independent recollection of having performed a lighting test. The fact that decedent was using a flashlight at the time of death supports plaintiffs’ assertion that the lighting was inadequate. Melendez was decedent’s helper for five years and had occasion to observe the conditions in the motor room on a regular basis. He testified that they had to use “a little flashlight to look . . . inside the cabinet” because they could not “see otherwise.” Both Melendez and Smith concurred that <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"638\" href=\"#p638\" id=\"p638\">*638</a>uncovered transformers could kill on contact, as happened here.</p>\n",

      "    <p id=\"b472-7\">The court’s determination lacks a sound and substantial basis in the record, which shows that visitation with the mother would not be in the children’s best interests <em>(see Matter of Tristram K., </em>25 AD3d 222, 228 [1st Dept 2005]). The court erroneously found that no visitation had occurred since 2012, overlooking a supervised therapeutic visit that took place in December 2013, which, in particular, caused the older child to suffer from a resurgence of stress and anxiety-related symptoms. Further, the court failed to address the numerous professional evaluations consistently recommending that visitation with the mother would be detrimental to the children (see <em>Young v Young, </em>212 AD2d 114, 118 [2d Dept 1995]). Neither did the court explain the basis for its conclusion that the agency was lax in its reunification efforts. Given the finding of neglect and abuse against the mother, and the documented history of stress and trauma triggered by previous visits with her, including a brief, unplanned encounter with the mother at the agency during the hearing, it was an improvident exercise of discretion for the Family Court to order a supervised therapeutic visit at this juncture <em>(see Matter of Justine N. [Patricia M.], </em>136 AD3d 452 [1st Dept 2016], <em>lv denied </em>27 NY3d 906 [2016]), especially after having precluded argument on the issue at the. permanency hearing.</p>\n",

Order, same court and Justice, entered August 9, 2017, which, to the extent appealed from as limited by the briefs, denied plaintiff’s motion for leave to renew, unanimously affirmed, without costs.</p>\n",
      "    <p id=\"b473-4\">Plaintiff is the owner of 411 East 76th Street in Manhattan. In June 2002, plaintiff agreed to lease the building to defendant City of New York so that it could be used as a public high school. Pursuant to the lease, plaintiff agreed to perform certain alterations and improvements to convert the building into a school.</p>\n",
      "    <p id=\"b473-5\">The motion court correctly dismissed plaintiff’s claim for payment for “extra work” to replace drywall interior vault room walls with concrete block walls, since the drawings made part of the lease called for those walls to be constructed of concrete, and plaintiff failed to provide proof that the parties agreed, either orally or in writing, to modify this lease term <em>(see Van Dorn Realty Corp. v Sundec Intl. Corp., </em>190 AD2d 516, 518 [1st Dept 1993]). Defendants’ failure to respond to plaintiff’s architect’s letter regarding interior wall construction does not modify the agreed-upon term, since the lease requires that specifications prepared by plaintiff’s architect be approved by defendants in writing.</p>\n",
      "    <p id=\"b473-6\">Plaintiff’s claims for payment for “additional work” in the kitchen and for reimbursement in connection with certain financing costs should not have been dismissed, as plaintiff met its burden to submit proof sufficient to raise a question of fact requiring a trial on those issues <em>(Kershaw v Hospital for Special Surgery, </em>114 AD3d 75, 82 [1st Dept 2013]).</p>\n",
      "    <p id=\"b473-7\">Plaintiff submitted an affidavit by its officer, saying that, at a meeting on October 30, 2002, the parties agreed that instead of installing a full “cooking kitchen,” as called for in the lease, the school would have only an electric warming pantry, to be installed by plaintiff. This affidavit was supported by, inter alia, a schematic for the kitchen marked “meeting of 10/30/02 changes to Kitchen design,” and signed by the five attendees, including a representative of defendants. In reply, defendants failed to submit an affidavit by anyone with knowledge of the relevant facts to dispute plaintiff’s account of the changes <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"640\" href=\"#p640\" id=\"p640\">*640</a>indicated by the schematic or deny that defendants had agreed to them, even though one of the October meeting attendees who signed the schematic, Michael Cona, defendant New York City Department of Education’s lease manager, had previously submitted an affidavit in support of defendants’ moving papers.<a class=\"footnotemark\" href=\"#footnote_1_1\" id=\"ref_footnote_1_1\">*</a></p>\n",
      "    <p id=\"b474-3\">The lease provides at paragraph 6.19 that the tenant shall reimburse the landlord for costs incurred in obtaining financing to pay startup costs for the alterations or to pay contractors and subcontractors when the tenant’s reimbursement for alteration costs are not received within 30 days. In opposition to defendants’ motion, plaintiff produced an affidavit by its officer, saying that a credit line was secured to pay alteration start up costs and contractor and subcontractor payments that plaintiff would incur, and saying “unequivocally” that plaintiff paid all of the sums sought in connection with the financing, which totaled $121,591. In support of the affidavit, plaintiff submitted a copy of a mortgage that it had taken out on the subject premises, which provided for an $850,000 term loan and a $2,100,000 line of credit, recorded on November 7, 2002, an invoice from the title company, invoices from the attorneys who represented plaintiff and the bank at the mortgage closing, correspondence from plaintiff’s mortgage attorneys listing disbursements of the mortgage proceeds, including attorneys’ fees, title company fees, and an appraisal fee, and correspondence between the parties regarding the financing costs. There are discrepancies between some of the supporting documents as to the amount of some costs. Defendants also question whether any or all of the loan costs sought were attributable to reimbursable expenditures under the lease, and argue that plaintiff failed to submit sufficient documentation of the financing costs for which it sought reimbursement in 2003 and 2005. However, defendants are in a poor position to make the latter argument, since they admit that the lease does not set forth any particular type of documentation required as a condition precedent to reimbursement. Indeed, the record before us indicates that defendants did not respond in writing at all to plaintiff’s requests for reimbursement in 2003, and responded to the 2005 request only by claiming they were “looking into” it. Although a principal attorney for the City’s School Construction Authority submitted an affidavit dated October 7, 2016, in which he claims he sought additional documentation from plaintiff, his claim is not supported by any correspondence or other documentation, and gives no time frame for the alleged <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"641\" href=\"#p641\" id=\"p641\">*641</a>request. Furthermore, this claim is contradicted by the affidavit by plaintiff’s officer, who says that defendants never rejected or objected to the demands. On this record, plaintiff has raised a question of fact as to whether and in what amount it is entitled to reimbursement for financing costs consistent with the terms of the lease.</p>\n",
      "    <p id=\"b475-4\">Finally, as Supreme Court stated, because the dispute here falls squarely within the scope of the parties’ lease, the unjust enrichment claim cannot stand <em>(see Clark-Fitzpatrick, Inc. v Long Is. R.R. Co., </em>70 NY2d 382, 388 [1987]).</p>\n",

      "    <p id=\"b475-10\">By failing to object, making general objections or failing to request any further relief after the court sustained an objection, defendant failed to preserve his present challenges to the prosecutor’s summation (see <em>People v Romero, </em>7 NY3d 911, 912 [2006]). “The word ‘objection’ alone [is] insufficient to preserve [an] issue” for review as a question of law <em>(People v Tevaha, </em>84 NY2d 879, 881 [1994]), and defendant’s assertion to the contrary is unavailing. We decline to review these challenges in the interest of justice. As an alternative holding, we conclude that while some of the challenged remarks should have been avoided, they were not so egregious or pervasive as to have deprived defendant of a fair trial <em>(see People v Overlee, </em>236 AD2d 133 [1st Dept 1997], <em>lv denied </em>91 NY2d 976 [1992]; <em>People v D'Alessandro, </em>184 AD2d 114, 118-119 [1st Dept 1992], <em>lv denied </em>81 NY2d 884 [1993]).

      "    <p id=\"b475-11\">We also conclude that defendant was not deprived of a fair trial by the prosecutor’s reference in his opening statement to a witness who ultimately did not testify.

      "    <p id=\"b478-2\"><a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"644\" href=\"#p644\" id=\"p644\">*644</a>Respondents met their burden of “articulating a particularized and specific justification for denying access” to the requested documents <em>(Matter of Data Tree, LLC v Romaine, </em>9 NY3d 454, 462-463 [2007] [internal quotation marks omitted]) on the grounds that they are exempt from disclosure as nonfinal intra-agency materials that “are entirely advisory in nature and rendered only to aid the actual decision-maker [s]” <em>(Rothenberg v City Univ. of N.Y., </em>191 AD2d 195, 196 [1st Dept 1993], <em>lv denied </em>81 NY2d 710 [1993]; <em>see </em>Public Officers Law § 87 [2] [g] [iii]; <em>Matter of Thomas v New York City Dept. of Educ., </em>137 AD3d 698, 698 [1st Dept 2016]).</p>\n",
      "    <p id=\"b478-3\">Petitioners’ argument that the requested documents are effectively the final documents because there are no later documents providing reasons for the failures to promote, other than the conclusory notification letters that the candidates were passed over, is unavailing. Respondents explain that, while the decision makers, including the Chief of Department who was the primary orchestrator, considered the requested documents in determining whom to promote, no documents exist encapsulating the final decision, other than the notice to petitioners. There is no statutory basis to look beyond respondents’ representation. Nor does FOIL require agencies “to formulate a final determination whe[re] none exists” <em>(Kheel v Ravitch, </em>93 AD2d 422, 430 [1st Dept 1983], <em>affd </em>62 NY2d 1 [1984]).</p>\n",
      "    <p id=\"b478-4\">We have considered petitioners’ remaining contentions and find them unavailing.</p>\n",

      "    <p id=\"b478-7\">Order, Supreme Court, New York County (David Benjamin Cohen, J.), entered October 6, 2017, which stayed the action in light of a pending matrimonial action, and denied plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment without prejudice and with leave to refile, unanimously reversed, on the law, without costs, and the matter remanded to the Supreme Court to determine the underlying motion for summary judgment.</p>\n",
      "    <p id=\"b478-8\">Under the circumstances of this case, the stay was not warranted. Although there are some interrelated issues in the pending divorce action between plaintiff’s daughter and defendant, they are not the same issues. Most importantly, plaintiff is not a party to the divorce action and cannot adjudicate his claim in that action. Although certain monies <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"645\" href=\"#p645\" id=\"p645\">*645</a>were ordered to be placed in escrow in the divorce action, there is no proof about the terms of the escrow, nor is there any indication that the monies are to used to benefit plaintiff, if he is ultimately found to be a legitimate creditor of defendant. Upon issuing the stay, the motion court denied the motion for summary judgment without prejudice to refile “if the issue raised in this motion is not resolved in the context of the matrimonial action.” We believe, however, that the motion court should have reached the merits of the motion for summary judgment and, therefore, we remand the matter to Supreme Court.</p>\n",
